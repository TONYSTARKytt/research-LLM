Collisional excitation of HNC by He found to be stronger than for structural isomer HCN in experiments at the low temperatures of interstellar space

HCN and its unstable isomer HNC are widely observed throughout the interstellar medium, with the HNC/HCN abundance ratio correlating strongly with temperature. In very cold environments HNC can even appear more abundant than HCN. Here we use a chirped pulse Fourier transform spectrometer to measure the pressure broadening of HCN and HNC, simultaneously formed in situ by laser photolysis and cooled to low temperatures in uniform supersonic flows of helium. Despite the apparent similarity of these systems, we find the HNC–He cross section to be more than twice as big as the HCN–He cross section at 10 K, confirming earlier quantum calculations. Our experimental results are supported by high-level scattering calculations and are also expected to apply with para-H2, demonstrating that HCN and HNC have different collisional excitation properties that strongly influence the derived interstellar abundances. HCN and its isomer HNC are both observed in the interstellar medium and inelastic collisions with helium and other species strongly influence their derived abundances. Now it has been shown experimentally and theoretically that HNC is much more strongly excited than HCN in collisions with helium at the low temperatures of interstellar space.

Active template strategy for the preparation of π-conjugated interlocked nanocarbons

Mechanically interlocked carbon nanostructures represent a relatively unexplored frontier in carbon nanoscience due to the difficulty in preparing these unusual topological materials. Here we illustrate an active-template method in which a [n]cycloparaphenylene precursor macrocycle is decorated with two convergent pyridine donors that coordinate to a metal ion. The metal ion catalyses alkyne–alkyne cross-coupling reactions within the central cavity of the macrocycle, and the resultant interlocked products can be converted into fully π-conjugated structures in subsequent synthetic steps. Specifically, we report the synthesis of a family of catenanes that comprise two or three mutually interpenetrating [n]cycloparaphenylene-derived macrocycles of various sizes. Additionally, a fully π-conjugated [3]rotaxane was synthesized by the same method. The development of synthetic methods to access mechanically interlocked carbon nanostructures of varying topology can help elucidate the implications of mechanical bonding for this emerging class of nanomaterials and allow structure–property relationships to be established. An active-template approach has been used to prepare π-conjugated interlocked nanocarbons derived from [n]cycloparaphenylenes. A metal ion bound within the central cavity of a precursor macrocycle first catalyses cross-coupling reactions and then the resulting mechanically interlocked intermediates are further transformed into π-conjugated species—[2] and [3]catenanes as well as a conjugated [3]rotaxane.

Capturing primary ozonides for a syn-dihydroxylation of olefins

Ozonolysis is a widely used and practical synthetic technique for the deconstructive oxidation of olefins using ozone. While there are numerous ozonolysis reactions that give a myriad of products and functionalities, almost all of them involve scission at the olefin double bond. Using ozone as a constructive reagent rather than a deconstructive one would open new domains of chemical reactivity and amplify molecular complexity in synthetic methodology. Here we report the use of primary ozonides as preparative synthetic intermediates for a safe and green olefin syn-dihydroxylation reaction. Furthermore, we have demonstrated this method using a continuous flow reactor that virtually eliminates peroxide accumulation and extended these applications towards the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules such as guaifenesin, the active ingredient in Mucinex, and a precursor to ponesimod, a drug to treat multiple sclerosis. Traditionally, ozone has been primarily used to oxidatively deconstruct carbon–carbon bonds. Now, it has been shown that ozone can be used for the construction of carbon–oxygen bonds without oxidative cleavage of the olefin substrate through capturing primary ozonides. Furthermore, intercepting primary ozonides with nucleophiles in continuous flow enabled the green, syn-dihydroxylation of olefins to be realized.

Title: 
Multistep, site-selective noncovalent synthesis of two-dimensional block supramolecular polymers

Although the principles of noncovalent bonding are well understood and form the basis for the syntheses of many intricate supramolecular structures, supramolecular noncovalent synthesis cannot yet achieve the levels of precision and complexity that are attainable in organic and/or macromolecular covalent synthesis. Here we show the stepwise synthesis of block supramolecular polymers from metal–porphyrin derivatives (in which the metal centre is Zn, Cu or Ni) functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains. These monomers first undergo a one-dimensional supramolecular polymerization and cyclization process to form a toroidal structure. Subsequently, successive secondary nucleation, elongation and cyclization steps result in two-dimensional assemblies with concentric toroidal morphologies. The site selectivity endowed by the fluorinated chains, reminiscent of regioselectivity in covalent synthesis, enables the precise control of the compositions and sequences of the supramolecular structures, as demonstrated by the synthesis of several triblock supramolecular terpolymers. Supramolecular structures are typically formed by the one-step self-assembly of building blocks. Now, a greater level of control has been achieved using stepwise non-covalent reactions under kinetic control. Two-dimensional block supramolecular polymers with tailored compositions and sequences were synthesized, and a site selectivity that is reminiscent of regioselectivity in covalent synthesis was observed.

Title: 
Synthesis and single-molecule imaging reveal stereospecific enhancement of binding kinetics by the antitumour eEF1A antagonist SR-A3

Ternatin-family cyclic peptides inhibit protein synthesis by targeting the eukaryotic elongation factor-1α. A potentially related cytotoxic natural product (‘A3’) was isolated from Aspergillus, but only 4 of its 11 stereocentres could be assigned. Here, we synthesized SR-A3 and SS-A3—two out of 128 possible A3 epimers—and discovered that synthetic SR-A3 is indistinguishable from naturally derived A3. Relative to SS-A3, SR-A3 exhibits an enhanced residence time and rebinding kinetics, as revealed by single-molecule fluorescence imaging of elongation reactions catalysed by eukaryotic elongation factor-1α in vitro. An increased residence time—stereospecifically conferred by the unique β-hydroxyl in SR-A3—was also observed in cells. Consistent with its prolonged duration of action, thrice-weekly dosing with SR-A3 led to a reduced tumour burden and increased survival in an aggressive Myc-driven mouse lymphoma model. Our results demonstrate the potential of SR-A3 as a cancer therapeutic and exemplify an evolutionary mechanism for enhancing cyclic peptide binding kinetics via stereospecific side-chain hydroxylation. The total synthesis and complete stereochemical assignment of the cyclic peptide natural product SR-A3—which has potential as a cancer therapeutic—has now been reported. Single-molecule biophysical and cellular experiments reveal a crucial, stereospecific role for a side-chain hydroxyl in SR-A3, which confers enhanced target residence time and efficacy in a mouse tumour model.

Genetically encoded lipid–polypeptide hybrid biomaterials that exhibit temperature-triggered hierarchical self-assembly

Post-translational modification of proteins is a strategy widely used in biological systems. It expands the diversity of the proteome and allows for tailoring of both the function and localization of proteins within cells as well as the material properties of structural proteins and matrices. Despite their ubiquity in biology, with a few exceptions, the potential of post-translational modifications in biomaterials synthesis has remained largely untapped. As a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a genetically encoded biohybrid material through post-translational modification, we report here the generation of a family of three stimulus-responsive hybrid materials—fatty-acid-modified elastin-like polypeptides—using a one-pot recombinant expression and post-translational lipidation methodology. These hybrid biomaterials contain an amphiphilic domain, composed of a β-sheet-forming peptide that is post-translationally functionalized with a C14 alkyl chain, fused to a thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide. They exhibit temperature-triggered hierarchical self-assembly across multiple length scales with varied structure and material properties that can be controlled at the sequence level. Inspired by the post-translational modifications of polypeptides widespread in biological systems, the one-pot synthesis of biohybrid materials was engineered within Escherichia coli using a recombinant expression and post-translational lipidation. The fatty-acid-modified elastin-like polypeptides (FAMEs) prepared, which comprise peptide-amphiphile segments prone to self-assembly fused to a thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide, exhibit temperature-triggered hierarchical assembly.

Demystifying the asymmetry-amplifying, autocatalytic behaviour of the Soai reaction through structural, mechanistic and computational studies

The Soai reaction has profoundly impacted chemists’ perspective of autocatalysis, chiral symmetry breaking, absolute asymmetric synthesis and its role in the origin of biological homochirality. Here we describe the unprecedented observation of asymmetry-amplifying autocatalysis in the alkylation of 5-(trimethylsilylethynyl)pyridine-3-carbaldehyde using diisopropylzinc. Kinetic studies with a surrogate substrate and spectroscopic analysis of a series of zinc alkoxides that incorporate specific structural mutations reveal a ‘pyridine-assisted cube escape’. The new tetrameric cluster functions as a catalyst that activates the substrate through a two-point binding mode and poises a coordinated diisopropylzinc moiety for alkyl group transfer. Transition-state models leading to both the homochiral and heterochiral products were validated by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, experimental and computational analysis of the heterochiral complex provides a definitive explanation for the nonlinear behaviour of this system. Our deconstruction of the Soai system reveals the structural logic for autocatalyst evolution, function and substrate compatibility—a central mechanistic aspect of this iconic transformation. The discovery of amplifying autocatalysis in a pyridine-3-carbaldehyde system facilitates a mechanistic deconstruction of the Soai reaction. A tetrameric autocatalyst, assembled by a combination of steric effects and nitrogen–zinc coordination, activates the substrate by two-point binding. This is followed by intra-complex isopropyl group transfer that generates the product alkoxide with high homochiral fidelity.

Connecting the geometric and electronic structures of the nitrogenase iron–molybdenum cofactor through site-selective 57Fe labelling

Understanding the chemical bonding in the catalytic cofactor of the Mo nitrogenase (FeMo-co) is foundational for building a mechanistic picture of biological nitrogen fixation. A persistent obstacle towards this goal has been that the 57Fe-based spectroscopic data—although rich with information—combines responses from all seven Fe sites, and it has therefore not been possible to map individual spectroscopic responses to specific sites in the three-dimensional structure. Here we have addressed this challenge by incorporating 57Fe into a single site of FeMo-co. Spectroscopic analysis of the resting state informed on the local electronic structure of the terminal Fe1 site, including its oxidation state and spin orientation, and, in turn, on the spin-coupling scheme for the entire cluster. The oxidized resting state and the first intermediate in nitrogen fixation were also characterized, and comparisons with the resting state provided molecular-level insights into the redox chemistry of FeMo-co. The molybdenum nitrogenase catalytic cofactor is composed of seven high-spin Fe sites making it difficult to study spectroscopically. Now it has been shown that 57Fe can be incorporated into a single site and that such site-selectively labelled samples provide insights into the cofactor’s electronic structure and the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation.

σ–σ Stacked supramolecular junctions

Intermolecular charge transport plays an essential role in organic electronic materials and biological systems. To date, experimental investigations of intermolecular charge transport in molecular materials and electronic devices have been restricted to conjugated systems in which π–π stacking interactions are involved. Herein we demonstrate that the σ–σ stacking interactions between neighbouring non-conjugated molecules offer an efficient pathway for charge transport through supramolecular junctions. The conductance of σ–σ stacked molecular junctions formed between two non-conjugated cyclohexanethiol or single-anchored adamantane molecules is comparable to that of π–π stacked molecular junctions formed between π-conjugated benzene rings. The current–voltage characteristics and flicker noise analysis demonstrate the existence of stacked molecular junctions formed between the electrode pairs and exhibit the characteristics of through-space charge transport. Density functional theory calculations combined with the non-equilibrium Green’s function method reveal that efficient charge transport occurs between two molecules configured with σ–σ stacking interactions. Supramolecular interactions play an essential role in organic electronic materials and biological systems. Now, it has been demonstrated that the σ–σ stacking interactions between neighbouring non-conjugated molecules can offer an efficient pathway for charge transport through supramolecular junctions, which provides a new guideline for the design and fabrication of organic materials and devices.

Confluence of theory and experiment reveals the catalytic mechanism of the Varkud satellite ribozyme

The Varkud satellite ribozyme catalyses site-specific RNA cleavage and ligation, and serves as an important model system to understand RNA catalysis. Here, we combine stereospecific phosphorothioate substitution, precision nucleobase mutation and linear free-energy relationship measurements with molecular dynamics, molecular solvation theory and ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical free-energy simulations to gain insight into the catalysis. Through this confluence of theory and experiment, we unify the existing body of structural and functional data to unveil the catalytic mechanism in unprecedented detail, including the degree of proton transfer in the transition state. Further, we provide evidence for a critical Mg2+ in the active site that interacts with the scissile phosphate and anchors the general base guanine in position for nucleophile activation. This novel role for Mg2+ adds to the diversity of known catalytic RNA strategies and unifies functional features observed in the Varkud satellite, hairpin and hammerhead ribozyme classes. The Varkud satellite ribozyme, which catalyses site-specific RNA cleavage and ligation, is an important model to understand RNA catalysis. Now, a combination of theoretical and experimental work has revealed new details about its catalytic mechanism. Mg2+ is shown to play an important role in organizing the active site, and the proton transfers in the transition state have also been identified.

A multiplexed, electrochemical interface for gene-circuit-based sensors

The field of synthetic biology has used the engineered assembly of synthetic gene networks to create a wide range of functions in biological systems. To date, gene-circuit-based sensors have primarily used optical proteins (for example, fluorescent, colorimetric) as reporter outputs, which has limited the potential to measure multiple distinct signals. Here we present an electrochemical interface that permits expanded multiplexed reporting for cell-free gene-circuit-based sensors. We have engineered a scalable system of reporter enzymes that cleave specific DNA sequences in solution, which results in an electrochemical signal when these newly liberated strands are captured at the surface of a nanostructured microelectrode. We describe the development of this interface and show its utility using a ligand-inducible gene circuit and toehold switch-based sensors by demonstrating the detection of multiple antibiotic resistance genes in parallel. This technology has the potential to expand the field of synthetic biology by providing an interface for materials, hardware and software. Gene-circuit-based sensors have, to date, largely relied on optical proteins (such as green fluorescent protein) to report the output, which limits the signalling bandwidth. Now, an electrochemical output has been developed and integrated with cell-free gene circuits. This approach enables multiplexing of sensors and introduces the possibility of electronic-based logic, memory and response elements to synthetic biology.

Title: 
Cobalt(II)–tetraphenylporphyrin-catalysed carbene transfer from acceptor–acceptor iodonium ylides via N-enolate–carbene radicals

Square-planar cobalt(II) systems have emerged as powerful carbene transfer catalysts for the synthesis of numerous (hetero)cyclic compounds via cobalt(III)–carbene radical intermediates. Spectroscopic detection and characterization of reactive carbene radical intermediates is limited to a few scattered experiments, centered around monosubstituted carbenes. Here, we reveal the formation of disubstituted cobalt(III)–carbene radicals derived from a cobalt(II)–tetraphenylporphyrin complex and acceptor–acceptor λ3-iodaneylidenes (iodonium ylides) as carbene precursors and their catalytic application. Iodonium ylides generate biscarbenoid species via reversible ligand modification of the paramagnetic cobalt(II)–tetraphenylporphyrin complex catalyst. Two interconnected catalytic cycles are involved in the overall mechanism, with a monocarbene radical and an N-enolate–carbene radical intermediate at the heart of each respective cycle. Notably, N-enolate formation is not a deactivation pathway but a reversible process, enabling transfer of two carbene moieties from a single N-enolate–carbene radical intermediate. The findings are supported by extensive experimental and computational studies. Although cobalt–carbene radicals have proved to be highly versatile intermediates for homogeneous catalysis, their spectroscopic detection and characterization have been limited. Now, by using hypervalent iodonium ylides, the formation and spectroscopic detection of a biscarbenoid N-enolate–carbene radical—which undergoes a complex catalytic pathway involving reversible N-enolate formation—has been demonstrated.

Incorporation of clusters within inorganic materials through their addition during nucleation steps

Nanomaterials are known to display chemical and physical behaviours that are different from those of their bulk counterparts, but assembly processes in the sub-nanometre region are difficult to control. The early growth of nanomaterials is typically thought to involve two separate steps: nucleation and the growth stage, as described by the LaMer model. Control of the shape and size of the final structure is typically determined during the growth stage by interactions between the nuclei and surrounding monomers. Here, we show that clusters with well-defined structures, such as polyoxometalates, can intervene at the nucleation stage of nickel oxysulfide and nickel–cobalt hydroxide by co-assembling with nuclei to produce uniform binary assemblies. Those can, in turn, incorporate a third, or also a fourth, type of nanocluster to form ternary or quaternary assemblies, respectively. Both binary and ternary assemblies are shown to serve as efficient atomic-site catalysts for room-temperature gasoline desulfurization and stereoselective catalytic reactions. During the synthesis of inorganic materials nickel oxysulfide and nickel–cobalt hydroxide, clusters with well-defined structures—such as polyoxometalates—can co-assemble with nuclei to produce uniform binary assemblies. The resulting materials can, in turn, incorporate a third, and fourth, type of nanocluster deposited on their surface to form ternary and quaternary assemblies, respectively.

Cyanide as a primordial reductant enables a protometabolic reductive glyoxylate pathway

Investigation of prebiotic metabolic pathways is predominantly based on abiotically replicating the reductive citric acid cycle. While attractive from a parsimony point of view, attempts using metal/mineral-mediated reductions have produced complex mixtures with inefficient and uncontrolled reactions. Here we show that cyanide acts as a mild and efficient reducing agent mediating abiotic transformations of tricarboxylic acid intermediates and derivatives. The hydrolysis of the cyanide adducts followed by their decarboxylation enables the reduction of oxaloacetate to malate and of fumarate to succinate, whereas pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate themselves are not reduced. In the presence of glyoxylate, malonate and malononitrile, alternative pathways emerge that bypass the challenging reductive carboxylation steps to produce metabolic intermediates and compounds found in meteorites. These results suggest a simpler prebiotic forerunner of today’s metabolism, involving a reductive glyoxylate pathway without oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate—implying that the extant metabolic reductive carboxylation chemistries are an evolutionary invention mediated by complex metalloproteins. It’s unclear how protometabolic reactions emerged and evolved into extant metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Now, it has been shown that cyanide acts as a mild and efficient reducing agent, mediating abiotic transformations of tricarboxylic acid intermediates and derivatives.

Title: 
Using supramolecular machinery to engineer directional charge propagation in photoelectrochemical devices

Molecular photoelectrochemical devices are hampered by electron–hole recombination after photoinduced electron transfer, causing losses in power conversion efficiency. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, we demonstrate the use of supramolecular machinery as a strategy to inhibit recombination through an organization of molecular components that enables unbinding of the final electron acceptor upon reduction. We show that preorganization of a macrocyclic electron acceptor to a dye yields a pseudorotaxane that undergoes a fast (completed within ~50 ps) ‘ring-launching’ event upon electron transfer from the dye to the macrocycle, releasing the anionic macrocycle and thus reducing charge recombination. Implementing this system into p-type dye-sensitized solar cells yielded a 16-fold and 5-fold increase in power conversion efficiency compared to devices based on the two control dyes that are unable to facilitate pseudorotaxane formation. The active repulsion of the anionic macrocycle with concomitant reformation of a neutral pseudorotaxane complex circumvents recombination at both the semiconductor–electrolyte and semiconductor–dye interfaces, enabling a threefold enhancement in hole lifetime. Photoelectrochemical cells are hampered by electron–hole recombination. Now, supramolecular machinery has enabled the docking of macrocyclic electron-accepting redox mediators to a dye through pseudorotaxane formation. Upon electron transfer from the dye, the anionic redox-mediator rings are launched away from the surface, reducing charge recombination, establishing charge separation and improving the efficiency of the solar cells in which they feature.

Adaptive insertion of a hydrophobic anchor into a poly(ethylene glycol) host for programmable surface functionalization

Covalent and non-covalent molecular binding are two strategies to tailor surface properties and functions. However, the lack of responsiveness and requirement for specific binding groups makes spatiotemporal control challenging. Here, we report the adaptive insertion of a hydrophobic anchor into a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) host as a non-covalent binding strategy for surface functionalization. By using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as the hydrophobic anchor, hydrophilic charged and non-charged functional modules were spontaneously loaded onto PEG corona in 2 min without the assistance of any catalysts and binding groups. The thermodynamically favourable insertion of the hydrophobic anchor can be reversed by pulling the functional module, enabling programmable surface functionalization. We anticipate that the adaptive molecular recognition between the hydrophobic anchor and the PEG host will challenge the hydrophilic understanding of PEG and enhance the progress in nanomedicine, advanced materials and nanotechnology. Modulation of surface properties and functions can be achieved through covalent and non-covalent molecular binding, but the lack of responsiveness and requirement for specific binding groups makes spatiotemporal control challenging. Now, it has been shown that adaptive insertion of a hydrophobic anchor into a poly(ethylene glycol) host is an effective non-covalent binding strategy for programmable surface functionalization.

Single-molecule visualization of DNA G-quadruplex formation in live cells

Substantial evidence now exists to support that formation of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) is coupled to altered gene expression. However, approaches that allow us to probe G4s in living cells without perturbing their folding dynamics are required to understand their biological roles in greater detail. Herein, we report a G4-specific fluorescent probe (SiR-PyPDS) that enables single-molecule and real-time detection of individual G4 structures in living cells. Live-cell single-molecule fluorescence imaging of G4s was carried out under conditions that use low concentrations of SiR-PyPDS (20 nM) to provide informative measurements representative of the population of G4s in living cells, without globally perturbing G4 formation and dynamics. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging and time-dependent chemical trapping of unfolded G4s in living cells reveal that G4s fluctuate between folded and unfolded states. We also demonstrate that G4 formation in live cells is cell-cycle-dependent and disrupted by chemical inhibition of transcription and replication. Our observations provide robust evidence in support of dynamic G4 formation in living cells. Visualization of endogenous G-quadruplexes (G4s) in living cells by fluorescence microscopy has been hampered by the high concentrations of G4-binding probes required, which can artificially induce additional G4 formation. Now, a G4-specific fluorescent probe (SiR-PyPDS) has been developed that enables single-molecule and real-time detection of individual G4 structures in living cells without perturbing G4 formation and dynamics.

Pt/Cu single-atom alloys as coke-resistant catalysts for efficient C–H activation

The recent availability of shale gas has led to a renewed interest in C–H bond activation as the first step towards the synthesis of fuels and fine chemicals. Heterogeneous catalysts based on Ni and Pt can perform this chemistry, but deactivate easily due to coke formation. Cu-based catalysts are not practical due to high C–H activation barriers, but their weaker binding to adsorbates offers resilience to coking. Using Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs), we examine C–H activation in a number of systems including methyl groups, methane and butane using a combination of simulations, surface science and catalysis studies. We find that Pt/Cu SAAs activate C–H bonds more efficiently than Cu, are stable for days under realistic operating conditions, and avoid the problem of coking typically encountered with Pt. Pt/Cu SAAs therefore offer a new approach to coke-resistant C–H activation chemistry, with the added economic benefit that the precious metal is diluted at the atomic limit. A renewed interest in C–H bond activation has developed on account of the recent increased availability of shale gas. Now, using a combination of surface science, microscopy, theory and nanoparticle studies, the ability of coke-resistant Pt/Cu single-atom alloys to efficiently activate C–H bonds in alkanes has been demonstrated under realistic catalytic conditions.

Energy funnelling within multichromophore architectures monitored with subnanometre resolution

The funnelling of energy within multichromophoric assemblies is at the heart of the efficient conversion of solar energy by plants. The detailed mechanisms of this process are still actively debated as they rely on complex interactions between a large number of chromophores and their environment. Here we used luminescence induced by scanning tunnelling microscopy to probe model multichromophoric structures assembled on a surface. Mimicking strategies developed by photosynthetic systems, individual molecules were used as ancillary, passive or blocking elements to promote and direct resonant energy transfer between distant donor and acceptor units. As it relies on organic chromophores as the elementary components, this approach constitutes a powerful model to address fundamental physical processes at play in natural light-harvesting complexes. Energy funnelling within multichromophoric assemblies is key to the conversion of solar energy by plants. Now, energy transport between phthalocyanine-based chromophores has been monitored at the submolecular level using scanning tunnelling microscopy, focusing on the role of ancillary, passive and blocking chromophores in promoting and directing energy transfer between distant donor and acceptor units.

Visualizing pore architecture and molecular transport boundaries in catalyst bodies with fluorescent nanoprobes

The performances of porous materials are closely related to the accessibility and interconnectivity of their porous domains. Visualizing pore architecture and its role on functionality—for example, mass transport—has been a challenge so far, and traditional bulk and often non-visual pore measurements have to suffice in most cases. Here, we present an integrated, facile fluorescence microscopy approach to visualize the pore accessibility and interconnectivity of industrial-grade catalyst bodies, and link it unequivocally with their catalytic performance. Fluorescent nanoprobes of various sizes were imaged and correlated with the molecular transport of fluorescent molecules formed during a separate catalytic reaction. A direct visual relationship between the pore architecture—which depends on the pore sizes and interconnectivity of the material selected—and molecular transport was established. This approach can be applied to other porous materials, and the insight gained may prove useful in the design of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts. The accessibility of materials’ porous domains is typically explored through bulk, and often non-visual, measurements. Now, an integrated fluorescence microscopy approach has established a direct visual relationship between pore architecture (which depends on pore sizes and interconnectivity), molecular transport, and in turn catalytic performance in industrial-grade catalyst particles.

Using collective knowledge to assign oxidation states of metal cations in metal–organic frameworks

Knowledge of the oxidation state of metal centres in compounds and materials helps in the understanding of their chemical bonding and properties. Chemists have developed theories to predict oxidation states based on electron-counting rules, but these can fail to describe oxidation states in extended crystalline systems such as metal–organic frameworks. Here we propose the use of a machine-learning model, trained on assignments by chemists encoded in the chemical names in the Cambridge Structural Database, to automatically assign oxidation states to the metal ions in metal–organic frameworks. In our approach, only the immediate local environment around a metal centre is considered. We show that the strategy is robust to experimental uncertainties such as incorrect protonation, unbound solvents or changes in bond length. This method gives good accuracy and we show that it can be used to detect incorrect assignments in the Cambridge Structural Database, illustrating how collective knowledge can be captured by machine learning and converted into a useful tool. Oxidation states help chemists to understand the bonding, properties and reactivity of compounds, but they can be difficult to determine for metal ions in extended crystalline materials. Now, oxidation states manually assigned to metal–organic frameworks have been harvested from the Cambridge Structural Database and used to build a machine-learning model that predicts oxidation states in metal–organic frameworks with good accuracy.

Heat flows in rock cracks naturally optimize salt compositions for ribozymes

Catalytic nucleic acids, such as ribozymes, are central to a variety of origin-of-life scenarios. Typically, they require elevated magnesium concentrations for folding and activity, but their function can be inhibited by high concentrations of monovalent salts. Here we show that geologically plausible high-sodium, low-magnesium solutions derived from leaching basalt (rock and remelted glass) inhibit ribozyme catalysis, but that this activity can be rescued by selective magnesium up-concentration by heat flow across rock fissures. In contrast to up-concentration by dehydration or freezing, this system is so far from equilibrium that it can actively alter the Mg:Na salt ratio to an extent that enables key ribozyme activities, such as self-replication and RNA extension, in otherwise challenging solution conditions. The principle demonstrated here is applicable to a broad range of salt concentrations and compositions, and, as such, highly relevant to various origin-of-life scenarios. The correct function of ribozymes in a prebiotic world would be dependent on the presence of optimal salt compositions and concentrations. Now, local heat fluxes have been shown to create an ideal salt habitat for ribozyme activity based on geologically plausible salt-leaching processes.

Reversible calcium alloying enables a practical room-temperature rechargeable calcium-ion battery with a high discharge voltage

Calcium-ion batteries (CIBs) are attractive candidates for energy storage because Ca2+ has low polarization and a reduction potential (−2.87 V versus standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) close to that of Li+ (−3.04 V versus SHE), promising a wide voltage window for a full battery. However, their development is limited by difficulties such as the lack of proper cathode/anode materials for reversible Ca2+ intercalation/de-intercalation, low working voltages (&lt;2 V), low cycling stability, and especially poor room-temperature performance. Here, we report a CIB that can work stably at room temperature in a new cell configuration using graphite as the cathode and tin foils as the anode as well as the current collector. This CIB operates on a highly reversible electrochemical reaction that combines hexafluorophosphate intercalation/de-intercalation at the cathode and a Ca-involved alloying/de-alloying reaction at the anode. An optimized CIB exhibits a working voltage of up to 4.45 V with capacity retention of 95% after 350 cycles. Calcium-ion batteries are potentially attractive alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, but remain largely unexplored because of low performance. A reversible calcium alloying/de-alloying reaction with the tin anode has now been coupled with the intercalation/de-intercalation of hexafluorophosphate in the graphite cathode to enable a calcium-ion battery that operates stably at room temperature.

Narrow-band single-photon emission through selective aryl functionalization of zigzag carbon nanotubes

The introduction of sp3 defects into single-walled carbon nanotubes through covalent functionalization can generate new light-emitting states and thus dramatically expand their optical functionality. This may open up routes to enhanced imaging, photon upconversion, and room-temperature single-photon emission at telecom wavelengths. However, a significant challenge in harnessing this potential is that the nominally simple reaction chemistry of nanotube functionalization introduces a broad diversity of emitting states. Precisely defining a narrow band of emission energies necessitates constraining these states, which requires extreme selectivity in molecular binding configuration on the nanotube surface. We show here that such selectivity can be obtained through aryl functionalization of so-called ‘zigzag’ nanotube structures to achieve a threefold narrowing in emission bandwidth. Accompanying density functional theory modelling reveals that, because of the associated structural symmetry, the defect states become degenerate, thus limiting emission energies to a single narrow band. We show that this behaviour can only result from a predominant selectivity for ortho binding configurations of the aryl groups on the nanotube lattice. Aryl functionalization of carbon nanotubes generates sp3 defects capable of quantum light emission. A multiplicity of possible binding configurations, however, leads to spectrally diverse emission bands. Now, it is shown that the structural symmetry of zigzag nanotubes and a high chemical selectivity for ortho configurations results in defect-state emission from a single narrow band.

Energy threshold for chiral symmetry breaking in molecular self-replication

The homochirality of biological molecules (right-handed sugars and left-handed amino acids) is a signature of life. Extensive research has been devoted to understanding how enrichment of one enantiomer over the other might have emerged from a prebiotic world. Here, we use experimental data from the model Soai autocatalytic reaction system to evaluate the energy required for symmetry breaking and chiral amplification in molecular self-replication. One postulate for the source of the original imbalance is the tiny difference in energy between enantiomers due to parity violation in the weak force. We discuss the plausibility of parity violation energy difference coupled with asymmetric autocatalysis as a rationalization for absolute asymmetric synthesis and the origin of the homochirality of biological molecules. Our results allow us to identify the magnitude of the energy imbalance that gives rise to directed symmetry breaking and asymmetric amplification in this autocatalytic system. Asymmetric autocatalysis—such as that observed experimentally in the Soai reaction—may have been responsible for the origin of biological homochirality. The magnitude of the energy imbalance required to induce directed symmetry breaking and asymmetric amplification in the Soai reaction has now been identified and compared to the parity violation energy difference.

Accurate structure models and absolute configuration determination using dynamical effects in continuous-rotation 3D electron diffraction data

Continuous-rotation 3D electron diffraction methods are increasingly popular for the structure analysis of very small organic molecular crystals and crystalline inorganic materials. Dynamical diffraction effects cause non-linear deviations from kinematical intensities that present issues in structure analysis. Here, a method for structure analysis of continuous-rotation 3D electron diffraction data is presented that takes multiple scattering effects into account. Dynamical and kinematical refinements of 12 compounds—ranging from small organic compounds to metal–organic frameworks to inorganic materials—are compared, for which the new approach yields significantly improved models in terms of accuracy and reliability with up to fourfold reduction of the noise level in difference Fourier maps. The intrinsic sensitivity of dynamical diffraction to the absolute structure is also used to assign the handedness of 58 crystals of 9 different chiral compounds, showing that 3D electron diffraction is a reliable tool for the routine determination of absolute structures. Continuous-rotation 3D electron diffraction is a powerful technique to determine structures from nanocrystals. A data treatment method that takes into account dynamical diffraction effects has now been shown to lead to more accurate structure models, better sensitivity to weak signals and a reliable determination of absolute configuration—even for materials containing only light atoms.

Non-equilibrium conditions inside rock pores drive fission, maintenance and selection of coacervate protocells

Key requirements for the first cells on Earth include the ability to compartmentalize and evolve. Compartmentalization spatially localizes biomolecules from a dilute pool and an evolving cell, which, as it grows and divides, permits mixing and propagation of information to daughter cells. Complex coacervate microdroplets are excellent candidates as primordial cells with the ability to partition and concentrate molecules into their core and support primitive and complex biochemical reactions. However, the evolution of coacervate protocells by fusion, growth and fission has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, a primordial environment initiated the evolution of coacervate-based protocells. Gas bubbles inside heated rock pores perturb the coacervate protocell distribution and drive the growth, fusion, division and selection of coacervate microdroplets. Our findings provide a compelling scenario for the evolution of membrane-free coacervate microdroplets on the early Earth, induced by common gas bubbles within heated rock pores. Complex coacervate microdroplets have been proposed as primordial cells, but their ability to evolve by fusion, growth and fission has not yet been demonstrated. Now, it has been shown that gas bubbles inside heated rock pores can drive the growth, fusion, division and selection of coacervate microdroplets.

Cobalt-catalysed C–H methylation for late-stage drug diversification

The magic methyl effect is well acknowledged in medicinal chemistry, but despite its significance, accessing such analogues via derivatization at a late stage remains a pivotal challenge. In an effort to mitigate this major limitation, we here present a strategy for the cobalt-catalysed late-stage C–H methylation of structurally complex drug molecules. Enabling broad applicability, the transformation relies on a boron-based methyl source and takes advantage of inherently present functional groups to guide the C–H activation. The relative reactivity observed for distinct classes of functionalities were determined and the sensitivity of the transformation towards a panel of common functional motifs was tested under various reaction conditions. Without the need for prefunctionalization or postdeprotection, a diverse array of marketed drug molecules and natural products could be methylated in a predictable manner. Subsequent physicochemical and biological testing confirmed the magnitude with which this seemingly minor structural change can affect important drug properties. Despite the importance of C–H methylation in medicinal chemistry, the application to densely functionalized complex molecules remains a challenge. Now, a novel cobalt-catalysed method takes advantage of inherently present functional groups to guide the C–H activation and a boron-based methyl source enables the late stage C–H methylation of pharmaceutically relevant substrates.

Direct dynamic read-out of molecular chirality with autonomous enzyme-driven swimmers

A key approach for designing bioinspired machines is to transfer concepts from nature to man-made structures by integrating biomolecules into artificial mechanical systems. This strategy allows the conversion of molecular information into macroscopic action. Here, we describe the design and dynamic behaviour of hybrid bioelectrochemical swimmers that move spontaneously at the air–water interface. Their motion is governed by the diastereomeric interactions between immobilized enantiopure oligomers and the enantiomers of a chiral probe molecule present in solution. These dynamic bipolar systems are able to convert chiral information present at the molecular level into enantiospecific macroscopic trajectories. Depending on the enantiomer in solution, the swimmers will move clockwise or anticlockwise; the concept can also be used for the direct visualization of the degree of enantiomeric excess by analysing the curvature of the trajectories. Deciphering in such a straightforward way the enantiomeric ratio could be useful for biomedical applications, for the read-out of food quality or as a more general analogue of polarimetric measurements. Self-propelled artificial chemical swimmers have previously been developed for chemical sensing. Now, hybrid bioelectrochemical swimmers, capable of translating chiral molecular information into macroscopic motion, have been developed. Diastereomeric interactions between enantiopure oligomers immobilized on the swimmer and a chiral molecule present in solution control the trajectory of the device.

Title: 
Near-infrared-activated anticancer platinum(IV) complexes directly photooxidize biomolecules in an oxygen-independent manner

Conventional light-driven cancer therapeutics require oxygen and visible light to indirectly damage biomolecules, limiting their efficacy in deep, hypoxic tumours. Here we report the use of near-infrared-activated small-molecule Pt(IV) photooxidants to directly oxidize intracellular biomolecules in an oxygen-independent manner, achieving controllable and effective elimination of cancer stem cells. These Pt(IV) complexes accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and show low toxicity in the dark. Upon irradiation, the resultant metal-enhanced photooxidation effect causes them to robustly photooxidize survival-related biomolecules, induce intense oxidative stress, disrupt intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis and initiate nonclassical necrosis. In vivo experiments confirm that the lead photooxidant can effectively inhibit tumour growth, suppress metastasis and activate the immune system. Our study validates the concept of metal-enhanced photooxidation and the subsequent chemotherapeutic applications, supporting the development of such localized photooxidants to directly damage intracellular biomolecules and decrease pHi as a strategy for effective metal-based drugs. Conventional photo-driven cancer treatment agents require oxygen and visible light to induce cell death, limiting their efficacy in deep, oxygen-poor tumours. Now, a class of NIR-activatable Pt(IV) photooxidants that target the endoplasmic reticulum have been shown to effectively overcome these limitations by directly oxidizing intracellular biomolecules in an oxygen-independent fashion, presenting a promising new direction for next-generation metal-based drug development.

Title: 
Mimicking oxidative radical cyclizations of lignan biosynthesis using redox-neutral photocatalysis

Oxidative cyclizations create many unique chemical structures that are characteristic of biologically active natural products. Many of these reactions are catalysed by ‘non-canonical’ or ‘thwarted’ iron oxygenases and appear to involve long-lived radicals. Mimicking these biosynthetic transformations with chemical equivalents has been a long-standing goal of synthetic chemists but the fleeting nature of radicals, particularly under oxidizing conditions, makes this challenging. Here we use redox-neutral photocatalysis to generate radicals that are likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of lignan natural products. We present the total syntheses of highly oxidized dibenzocyclooctadienes, which feature densely fused, polycyclic frameworks that originate from a common radical progenitor. We show that multiple factors control the fate of the proposed biosynthetic radicals, as they select between 5- or 11-membered ring cyclizations and a number of different terminating events. Our syntheses create new opportunities to explore the medicinal properties of these natural products, while shedding light on their biosynthetic origin. Many biosynthetic cyclizations are catalysed by iron oxygenases and appear to involve long-lived radical species. Now, mimicking these biosynthetic transformations, the total synthesis of highly oxidized lignan natural products has been reported using redox-neutral photocatalysis to enable late-stage radical cyclizations that install challenging 5- and 11-membered rings.

Controlling Pd(iv) reductive elimination pathways enables Pd(ii)-catalysed enantioselective C(sp3)−H fluorination

The development of a Pd(ii)-catalysed enantioselective fluorination of C(sp3)−H bonds would offer a new approach to making chiral organofluorines. However, such a strategy is particularly challenging because of the difficulty in differentiating prochiral C(sp3)−H bonds through Pd(ii)-insertion, as well as the sluggish reductive elimination involving Pd−F bonds. Here, we report the development of a Pd(ii)-catalysed enantioselective C(sp3)−H fluorination using a chiral transient directing group strategy. In this work, a bulky, amino amide transient directing group was developed to control the stereochemistry of the C−H insertion step and selectively promote the C(sp3)−F reductive elimination pathway from the Pd(iv)–F intermediate. Stereochemical analysis revealed that while the desired C(sp3)−F formation proceeds via an inner-sphere pathway with retention of configuration, the undesired C(sp3)−O formation occurs through an SN2-type mechanism. Elucidation of the dual mechanism allows us to rationalize the profound ligand effect on controlling reductive elimination selectivity from high-valent Pd species. Metal-catalysed enantioselective fluorination of C(sp3)–H bonds is an attractive method for preparing chiral organofluorines, but the challenge of achieving both enantioselectivity and reductive elimination selectivity remains unsolved. Now, it has been demonstrated that a chiral amino amide transient directing group can serve as a ligand for a palladium catalyst that promotes both enantioselective C(sp3)–H insertion and C(sp3)–F-selective reductive elimination.

Stepwise on-demand functionalization of multihydrosilanes enabled by a hydrogen-atom-transfer photocatalyst based on eosin Y

Organosilanes are of vital importance for modern human society, having found widespread applications in functional materials, organic synthesis, drug discovery and life sciences. However, their preparation remains far from trivial, and on-demand synthesis of heteroleptic substituted silicon reagents is a formidable challenge. The generation of silyl radicals from hydrosilanes via direct hydrogen-atom-transfer (HAT) photocatalysis represents the most atom-, step-, redox- and catalyst-economic pathway for the activation of hydrosilanes. Here, in view of the green characteristics of neutral eosin Y (such as its abundance, low cost, metal-free nature, absorption of visible light and excellent selectivity), we show that using it as a direct HAT photocatalyst enables the stepwise custom functionalization of multihydrosilanes, giving access to fully substituted silicon compounds. By exploiting this strategy, we realize preferable hydrogen abstraction of Si–H bonds in the presence of active C–H bonds, diverse functionalization of hydrosilanes (for example, alkylation, vinylation, allylation, arylation, deuteration, oxidation and halogenation), and remarkably selective monofunctionalization of di- and trihydrosilanes. The controlled functionalization of multihydrosilanes is challenging. Now, using a hydrogen-atom-transfer photocatalyst based on neutral eosin Y, a method for the diverse functionalization of hydrosilanes has been developed, enabling the stepwise on-demand decoration of silicon atoms. This approach is distinguished by its atom-, step-, redox- and catalyst-economy, metal-free nature, its versatility (&gt;150 examples), modularity, selectivity and scalability.

Lysine acylation using conjugating enzymes for site-specific modification and ubiquitination of recombinant proteins

Enzymes are powerful tools for protein labelling due to their specificity and mild reaction conditions. Many protocols, however, are restricted to modifications at protein termini, rely on non-peptidic metabolites or require large recognition domains. Here we report a chemoenzymatic method, which we call lysine acylation using conjugating enzymes (LACE), to site-specifically modify folded proteins at internal lysine residues. LACE relies on a minimal genetically encoded tag (four residues) recognized by the E2 small ubiquitin-like modifier-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and peptide or protein thioesters. Together, this approach obviates the need for E1 and E3 enzymes, enabling isopeptide formation with just Ubc9 in a programmable manner. We demonstrate the utility of LACE by the site-specific attachment of biochemical probes, one-pot dual-labelling in combination with sortase, and the conjugation of wild-type ubiquitin and ISG15 to recombinant proteins. A chemoenzymatic method to site-specifically conjugate peptide and protein thioesters to folded proteins at lysine residues has been developed. The method uses a genetically encoded four-residue tag that is recognized by the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. This approach enables isopeptide formation with just Ubc9 in a programmable manner and obviates the need for E1 and E3 enzymes.

Title: 
Stereo- and regiodefined DNA-encoded chemical libraries enable efficient tumour-targeting applications

The encoding of chemical compounds with amplifiable DNA tags facilitates the discovery of small-molecule ligands for proteins. To investigate the impact of stereo- and regiochemistry on ligand discovery, we synthesized a DNA-encoded library of 670,752 derivatives based on 2-azido-3-iodophenylpropionic acids. The library was selected against multiple proteins and yielded specific ligands. The selection fingerprints obtained for a set of protein targets of pharmaceutical relevance clearly showed the preferential enrichment of ortho-, meta- or para-regioisomers, which was experimentally verified by affinity measurements in the absence of DNA. The discovered ligands included novel selective enzyme inhibitors and binders to tumour-associated antigens, which enabled conditional chimeric antigen receptor T-cell activation and tumour targeting. A DNA-encoded chemical library based on regio- and stereoisomers of phenylalanine has been synthesized and used for affinity-based selections against multiple target proteins. This approach led to the isolation and validation of potent ligands capable of CAR T-cell activation and tumour targeting.

Frenkel excitons in heat-stressed supramolecular nanocomposites enabled by tunable cage-like scaffolding

Delocalized Frenkel excitons—coherently shared excitations among chromophores—are responsible for the remarkable efficiency of supramolecular light-harvesting assemblies within photosynthetic organisms. The translation of nature’s design principles to applications in optoelectronic devices has been limited by the fragility of the supramolecular structures used and the delicate nature of Frenkel excitons, particularly under mildly changing solvent conditions and elevated temperatures and upon deposition onto solid substrates. Here, we overcome those functionalization barriers through composition of stable supramolecular light-harvesting nanotubes enabled by tunable (~4.3–4.9 nm), uniform (±0.3 nm) cage-like scaffolds. High-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy, combined with scanning electron microscopy, broadband femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and near-field scanning optical microscopy revealed that excitons within the cage-like scaffolds are robust, even under extreme heat stress, and control over nanocomposite dimensions is maintained on solid substrates. Our bio-inspired nanocomposites provide a general framework for the development of next-generation organic devices made from stable supramolecular materials. Nature successfully uses supramolecular assemblies for efficient and robust solar energy harvesting; however, mimicking such material systems for applications in optoelectronic devices has been hampered by stability issues such as the fragility of the supramolecular structures used and the delicate nature of Frenkel excitons. Now, enabled by tunable cage-like scaffolds, stable supramolecular light-harvesting nanotubes have been composed that are robust even under heat stress.

E- and Z-, di- and tri-substituted alkenyl nitriles through catalytic cross-metathesis

Nitriles are found in many bioactive compounds, and are among the most versatile functional groups in organic chemistry. Despite many notable recent advances, however, there are no approaches that may be used for the preparation of di- or tri-substituted alkenyl nitriles. Related approaches that are broad in scope and can deliver the desired products in high stereoisomeric purity are especially scarce. Here, we describe the development of several efficient catalytic cross-metathesis strategies, which provide direct access to a considerable range of Z- or E-di-substituted cyano-substituted alkenes or their corresponding tri-substituted variants. Depending on the reaction type, a molybdenum-based monoaryloxide pyrrolide or chloride (MAC) complex may be the optimal choice. The utility of the approach, enhanced by an easy to apply protocol for utilization of substrates bearing an alcohol or a carboxylic acid moiety, is highlighted in the context of applications to the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Nitriles are widely used in chemistry and are found in many bioactive compounds but, despite recent advances, there are no broadly applicable approaches for the synthesis of di- or tri-substituted alkenyl nitriles. New catalytic cross-metathesis strategies now allow direct access to a wide range of Z- or E-di-substituted cyano-substituted alkenes and their tri-substituted variants.

Chemoselective methylene oxidation in aromatic molecules

Despite significant progress in the development of site-selective aliphatic C–H oxidations over the past decade, the ability to oxidize strong methylene C–H bonds in the presence of more oxidatively labile aromatic functionalities remains a major unsolved problem. Such chemoselective reactivity is highly desirable for enabling late-stage oxidative derivatizations of pharmaceuticals and medicinally important natural products that often contain such functionality. Here, we report a simple manganese small-molecule catalyst Mn(CF3–PDP) system that achieves such chemoselectivity via an unexpected synergy of catalyst design and acid additive. Preparative remote methylene oxidation is obtained in 50 aromatic compounds housing medicinally relevant halogen, oxygen, heterocyclic and biaryl moieties. Late-stage methylene oxidation is demonstrated on four drug scaffolds, including the ethinylestradiol scaffold where other non-directed C–H oxidants that tolerate aromatic groups effect oxidation at only activated tertiary benzylic sites. Rapid generation of a known metabolite (piragliatin) from an advanced intermediate is demonstrated. A small-molecule manganese-based catalyst has been developed for the selective oxidation of strong methylene C–H bonds in the presence of more oxidatively labile aromatic functionality. This reaction enables the late-stage oxidative derivatization of medicinally relevant compound scaffolds and may also prove useful for diversifying aromatic drugs and natural products, as well as helping to quickly identify their metabolites.

Illuminating the dark conformational space of macrocycles using dominant rotors

Three-dimensional conformation is the primary determinant of molecular properties. The thermal energy available at room temperature typically equilibrates the accessible conformational states. Here, we introduce a method for isolating unique and previously understudied conformations of macrocycles. The observation of unusual conformations of 16- to 22-membered rings has been made possible by controlling their interconversion using dominant rotors, which represent tunable atropisomeric constituents with relatively high rotational barriers. Density functional theory and in situ NMR measurements suggest that dominant rotor candidates for the amino-acid-based structures considered here should possess a rotational energy barrier of at least 25 kcal mol−1. Notable differences in the geometries of the macrocycle conformations were identified by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. There is evidence that amino acid residues can be forced into rare turn motifs not observed in the corresponding linear counterparts and homodetic rings. These findings should unlock new avenues for studying the conformation–activity relationships of bioactive molecules. Constrained molecules typically adopt one major conformation and this limitation prevents the study of other energetically less-favourable conformations. Nevertheless, these alternate structures might prove to be useful and it has now been shown that a dominant rotor method can alter the energetic landscape of peptides to create two-well systems with distinct conformational behaviour.

Anisotropic dynamics of resonant scattering between a pair of cold aligned diatoms

The collision dynamics between a pair of aligned molecules in the presence of a partial-wave resonance provide the most sensitive probe of the long-range anisotropic forces important to chemical reactions. Here we control the collision temperature and geometry to probe the dynamics of cold (1–3 K) rotationally inelastic scattering of a pair of optically state-prepared D2 molecules. The collision temperature is manipulated by combining the gating action of laser state preparation and detection with the velocity dispersion of the molecular beam. When the bond axes of both molecules are aligned parallel to the collision velocity, the scattering rate drops by a factor of 3.5 as collision energies &gt;2.1 K are removed, suggesting a geometry-dependent resonance. Partial-wave analysis of the measured angular distribution supports a shape resonance within the centrifugal barrier of the l = 2 incoming orbital. Our experiment illustrates the strong anisotropy of the quadrupole–quadrupole interaction that controls the dynamics of resonant scattering. The collision dynamics between a pair of aligned molecules in the presence of a scattering resonance provide the most sensitive probe of the long-range anisotropic forces important to chemistry. By simultaneously controlling the collision temperature and geometry between a pair of aligned D2 molecules, we unravel the anisotropic dynamics of a cold scattering process.

An NmrA-like enzyme-catalysed redox-mediated Diels–Alder cycloaddition with anti-selectivity

The Diels–Alder cycloaddition is one of the most powerful approaches in organic synthesis and is often used in the synthesis of important pharmaceuticals. Yet, strictly controlling the stereoselectivity of the Diels–Alder reactions is challenging, and great efforts are needed to construct complex molecules with desired chirality via organocatalysis or transition-metal strategies. Nature has evolved different types of enzymes to exquisitely control cyclization stereochemistry; however, most of the reported Diels–Alderases have been shown to only facilitate the energetically favourable diastereoselective cycloadditions. Here we report the discovery and characterization of CtdP, a member of a new class of bifunctional oxidoreductase/Diels–Alderase, which was previously annotated as an NmrA-like transcriptional regulator. We demonstrate that CtdP catalyses the inherently disfavoured cycloaddition to form the bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane scaffold with a strict α-anti-selectivity. Guided by computational studies, we reveal a NADP+/NADPH-dependent redox mechanism for the CtdP-catalysed inverse electron demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition, which serves as the first example of a bifunctional Diels–Alderase that utilizes this mechanism. A Diels–Alderase that catalyses the inherently disfavoured cycloaddition and forms a bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane scaffold with a strict α-anti-selectivity has now been discovered. This Diels–Alderase, called CtdP, is an NmrA-like protein. Isotopic labelling, structural biology and computational studies reveal that the CtdP-catalysed Diels–Alder reaction involves a NADP+/NADPH-dependent redox mechanism.

A catalytically active [Mn]-hydrogenase incorporating a non-native metal cofactor

Nature carefully selects specific metal ions for incorporation into the enzymes that catalyse the chemical reactions necessary for life. Hydrogenases, enzymes that activate molecular H2, exclusively utilize Ni and Fe in [NiFe]-, [FeFe]- and [Fe]-hydrogeanses. However, other transition metals are known to activate or catalyse the production of hydrogen in synthetic systems. Here, we report the development of a biomimetic model complex of [Fe]-hydrogenase that incorporates a Mn, as opposed to a Fe, metal centre. This Mn complex is able to heterolytically cleave H2 as well as catalyse hydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of the model into an apoenzyme of [Fe]-hydrogenase results in a [Mn]-hydrogenase with an enhanced occupancy-normalized activity over an analogous semi-synthetic [Fe]-hydrogenase. These findings demonstrate a non-native metal hydrogenase that shows catalytic functionality and that hydrogenases based on a manganese active site are viable. Natural hydrogenases exclusively utilize Ni and/or Fe to activate or produce hydrogen. Now, a catalytically active [Mn]-hydrogenase has been prepared by incorporating a synthetic Mn complex into the apoenzyme of [Fe]-Hydrogenase. The semi-synthetic [Mn]-hydrogenase shows higher activity than the corresponding Fe analogue.

Catalytic activation of unstrained C(aryl)–C(aryl) bonds in 2,2′-biphenols

Transition metal catalysis has emerged as an important means for C–C activation that allows mild and selective transformations. However, the current scope of C–C bonds that can be activated is primarily restricted to either highly strained systems or more polarized C–C bonds. In contrast, the catalytic activation of non-polar and unstrained C–C moieties remains an unmet challenge. Here we report a general approach for the catalytic activation of the unstrained C(aryl)–C(aryl) bonds in 2,2′-biphenols. The key is to utilize the phenol moiety as a handle to install phosphinites as a recyclable directing group. Using hydrogen gas as the reductant, monophenols are obtained with a low catalyst loading and high functional group tolerance. This approach is also applied to the synthesis of 2,3,4-trisubstituted phenols. A further mechanistic study suggests that the C–C activation step is mediated by a rhodium(i) monohydride species. Finally, a preliminary study on breaking the inert biphenolic moieties in lignin models is illustrated. Catalytic activation of non-polar unstrained C−C bonds remains challenging. Now, the C(aryl)−C(aryl) bonds in 2,2′-biphenols can be cleaved using phosphinites as a recyclable directing group through a rhodium-based spirocyclic intermediate. In particular, the biaryl linkage found in softwood lignin could be cleaved using this method.

Title: 
Efficient room-temperature phosphorescence of covalent organic frameworks through covalent halogen doping

Organic room-temperature phosphorescence, a spin-forbidden radiative process, has emerged as an interesting but rare phenomenon with multiple potential applications in optoelectronic devices, biosensing and anticounterfeiting. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with accessible nanoscale porosity and precisely engineered topology can offer unique benefits in the design of phosphorescent materials, but these are presently unexplored. Here, we report an approach of covalent doping, whereby a COF is synthesized by copolymerization of halogenated and unsubstituted phenyldiboronic acids, allowing for random distribution of functionalized units at varying ratios, yielding highly phosphorescent COFs. Such controlled halogen doping enhances the intersystem crossing while minimizing triplet–triplet annihilation by diluting the phosphors. The rigidity of the COF suppresses vibrational relaxation and allows a high phosphorescence quantum yield (ΦPhos ≤ 29%) at room temperature. The permanent porosity of the COFs and the combination of the singlet and triplet emitting channels enable a highly efficient COF-based oxygen sensor, with an ultra-wide dynamic detection range (~103–10−5 torr of partial oxygen pressure). Room-temperature phosphorescence in organic solids is attractive for practical applications but remains rare. Now, highly phosphorescent boroxine-linked covalent organic frameworks have been prepared by covalent doping with halogen atoms through the use of halogenated precursors. The resulting porous COFs exhibited oxygen-sensing capabilities with millisecond response time over a wide range of partial oxygen pressures.

Glory scattering in deeply inelastic molecular collisions

For molecular collisions, the deflection of a molecule’s trajectory provides one of the most sensitive probes of the interaction potential and there are general rules of thumb that relate the direction of deflection to precollision conditions. Following intuition, forward scattering results from glancing collisions, whereas near head-on collisions result in back scattering. Here we present the observation of forward scattering in inelastic processes that defies this common wisdom. For deeply inelastic collisions between NO radicals and CO or HD molecules, we observed forward scattering in fully resolved pair-correlated differential cross-sections, despite the low impact parameters that are needed to induce a sufficient energy transfer. We rationalized these findings by extending the textbook model of hard-sphere scattering—taking inelastic energy transfer into account—and attribute the forward scattering to glory-type trajectories caused by attractive forces. This phenomenon, which we refer to as hard-collision glory scattering, is predicted to be ubiquitous. We derive under which conditions hard-collision glory scattering occurs and retrospectively identify such behaviour in previously studied systems. Molecular energy transfer is thought to follow a simple rule of thumb: high energy transfer requires hard collisions that result in backscattering. However, now it has been observed that an unexpected forward scattering occurs in NO–CO and NO–HD collisions even for high energy transfer. This is attributed to ‘hard-collision glory scattering’, a mechanism that appears to be ubiquitous in molecule–molecule collisions.

Slow charge transfer from pentacene triplet states at the Marcus optimum

Singlet fission promises to surpass the Shockley–Queisser limit for single-junction solar cell efficiency through the production of two electron–hole pairs per incident photon. However, this promise has not been fulfilled because singlet fission produces two low-energy triplet excitons that have been unexpectedly difficult to dissociate into free charges. To understand this phenomenon, we study charge separation from triplet excitons in polycrystalline pentacene using an electrochemical series of 12 different guest electron-acceptor molecules with varied reduction potentials. We observe separate optima in the charge yield as a function of driving force for singlet and triplet excitons, including inverted regimes for the dissociation of both states. Molecular acceptors can thus provide a strategic advantage to singlet fission solar cells by suppressing singlet dissociation at optimal driving forces for triplet dissociation. However, even at the optimal driving force, the rate constant for charge transfer from the triplet state is surprisingly small, ~107 s−1, presenting a previously unidentified obstacle to the design of efficient singlet fission solar cells. Singlet fission produces two low-energy triplet excitons that are difficult to dissociate into free charges. Now, separate optima in charge yield have been observed as a function of driving force for singlet and triplet excitons in pentacene. At optimal driving forces, the triplet-exciton dissociation rate is at least five orders of magnitude smaller than the singlet-exciton dissociation rate.

Direct α-alkylation of primary aliphatic amines enabled by CO2 and electrostatics

Primary aliphatic amines are important building blocks in organic synthesis due to the presence of a synthetically versatile NH2 group. N-functionalization of primary amines is well established, but selective C-functionalization of unprotected primary amines remains challenging. Here, we report the use of CO2 as an activator for the direct transformation of abundant primary aliphatic amines into valuable γ-lactams under photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis. Experimental and computational studies suggest that CO2 not only inhibits undesired N-alkylation of primary amines, but also promotes selective intermolecular HAT by an electrostatically accelerated interaction between the in situ-generated negatively charged carbamate and the positively charged quinuclidinium radical. This electrostatic attraction overwhelms the inherent bond dissociation energies which suggest that HAT should occur unselectively. We anticipate that our findings will open up new avenues for amine functionalizations as well as selectivity control in HAT reactions. CO2 can be used as an activator for the direct transformation of abundant and unprotected primary aliphatic amines into valuable γ-lactams under photoredox and hydrogen-atom-transfer catalysis. Electrostatic interactions between the in situ generated alkylammonium carbamate and the positively charged quinuclidinium radical lead to regioselective hydrogen atom abstraction.

Chemoselective oxidative generation of ortho-quinone methides and tandem transformations

ortho-Quinone methides are useful transient synthetic intermediates in organic synthesis. These species are most often generated in situ by the acid- or base-mediated transformation of phenols that have been pre-functionalized at a benzylic position, or by biomimetic oxidation of the corresponding ortho-alkylphenols with metal oxidants or transition-metal complexes. Here we describe a method for the transition-metal-free oxidative generation of o-QMs from ortho-alkylarenols, using hypoiodite catalysis under nearly neutral conditions, which can then be applied in one-pot tandem reactions. This method for the chemoselective oxidative generation of ortho-quinone methides may prove superior to previous methods with respect to environmental issues and scope, and can be applied to various tandem reactions such as inter- or intramolecular [4 + 2] cycloaddition, oxa-6π-electrocyclization, conjugate addition and spiroepoxidation. ortho-Quinone methides are highly reactive transient intermediates found in some organic syntheses and biological processes. The generation of these species often requires pre-functionalized substrates and/or metal oxidants, but now the chemoselective oxidative generation of ortho-quinone methides from ortho-alkylarenols has been achieved using hypoiodite catalysis under nearly neutral conditions.

Controlled masking and targeted release of redox-cycling ortho-quinones via a C–C bond-cleaving 1,6-elimination

Natural products that contain ortho-quinones show great potential as anticancer agents but have been largely discarded from clinical development because their redox-cycling behaviour results in general systemic toxicity. Here we report conjugation of ortho-quinones to a carrier, which simultaneously masks their underlying redox activity. C-benzylation at a quinone carbonyl forms a redox-inactive benzyl ketol. Upon a specific enzymatic trigger, an acid-promoted, self-immolative C–C bond-cleaving 1,6-elimination mechanism releases the redox-active hydroquinone inside cells. By using a 5-lipoxygenase modulator, β-lapachone, we created cathepsin-B-cleavable quinone prodrugs. We applied the strategy for intracellular release of β-lapachone upon antibody-mediated delivery. Conjugation of protected β-lapachone to Gem-IgG1 antibodies, which contain the variable region of gemtuzumab, results in homogeneous, systemically non-toxic and conditionally stable CD33+-specific antibody–drug conjugates with in vivo efficacy against a xenograft murine model of acute myeloid leukaemia. This protection strategy could allow the use of previously overlooked natural products as anticancer agents, thus extending the range of drugs available for next-generation targeted therapeutics. A strategy for protecting redox-active ortho-quinones, which show promise as anticancer agents but suffer from redox-cycling behaviour and systemic toxicity, has been developed. The ortho-quinones are derivatized to redox-inactive para-aminobenzyl ketols. Upon amine deprotection, an acid-promoted, self-immolative C–C bond-cleaving 1,6-elimination releases the redox-active hydroquinone. The strategy also enables conjugation to a carrier for targeted delivery of ortho-quinone species.

Expanding the substrate scope of pyrrolysyl-transfer RNA synthetase enzymes to include non-α-amino acids in vitro and in vivo

The absence of orthogonal aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases that accept non-l-α-amino acids is a primary bottleneck hindering the in vivo translation of sequence-defined hetero-oligomers and biomaterials. Here we report that pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) and certain PylRS variants accept α-hydroxy, α-thio and N-formyl-l-α-amino acids, as well as α-carboxy acid monomers that are precursors to polyketide natural products. These monomers are accommodated and accepted by the translation apparatus in vitro; those with reactive nucleophiles are incorporated into proteins in vivo. High-resolution structural analysis of the complex formed between one PylRS enzyme and a m-substituted 2-benzylmalonic acid derivative revealed an active site that discriminates prochiral carboxylates and accommodates the large size and distinct electrostatics of an α-carboxy substituent. This work emphasizes the potential of PylRS-derived enzymes for acylating tRNA with monomers whose α-substituent diverges substantially from the α-amine of proteinogenic amino acids. These enzymes or derivatives thereof could synergize with natural or evolved ribosomes and/or translation factors to generate diverse sequence-defined non-protein heteropolymers. Ribosomal incorporation of non-α-amino acid monomers into proteins is largely restricted to in vitro translation. Now, pyrrolysyl-transfer RNA synthetase variants have been shown to acylate tRNAs with α-thio acids, malonic acids, and N-formyl amino acids. This work represents a key step towards the programmed ribosomal synthesis of sequence-defined non-protein polymers in cellulo.

Direct observation of the influence of cardiolipin and antibiotics on lipid II binding to MurJ

Translocation of lipid II across the cytoplasmic membrane is essential in peptidoglycan biogenesis. Although most steps are understood, identifying the lipid II flippase has yielded conflicting results, and the lipid II binding properties of two candidate flippases—MurJ and FtsW—remain largely unknown. Here we apply native mass spectrometry to both proteins and characterize lipid II binding. We observed lower levels of lipid II binding to FtsW compared to MurJ, consistent with MurJ having a higher affinity. Site-directed mutagenesis of MurJ suggests that mutations at A29 and D269 attenuate lipid II binding to MurJ, whereas chemical modification of A29 eliminates binding. The antibiotic ramoplanin dissociates lipid II from MurJ, whereas vancomycin binds to form a stable complex with MurJ:lipid II. Furthermore, we reveal cardiolipins associate with MurJ but not FtsW, and exogenous cardiolipins reduce lipid II binding to MurJ. These observations provide insights into determinants of lipid II binding to MurJ and suggest roles for endogenous lipids in regulating substrate binding. Most steps in peptidoglycan biosynthesis are understood, but the lipid II binding properties to the flippases MurJ and FtsW remain unknown. Now, it has been shown that lipid II exhibits preferential binding to MurJ, which is modulated by ramoplanin and cardiolipins. These insights into the lipid II binding determinants suggest roles for lipids in regulating substrate binding.

Structure, reactivity and catalytic properties of manganese-hydride amidate complexes

The high efficiency of widely applied Noyori-type hydrogenation catalysts arises from the N–H moiety coordinated to a metal centre, which stabilizes rate-determining transition states through hydrogen-bonding interactions. It was proposed that a higher efficiency could be achieved by substituting an N–M′ group (M′ = alkali metals) for the N–H moiety using a large excess of metal alkoxides (M′OR); however, such a metal-hydride amidate intermediate has not yet been isolated. Here we present the synthesis, isolation and reactivity of a metal-hydride amidate complex (HMn–NLi). Kinetic studies show that the rate of hydride transfer from HMn–NLi to a ketone is 24-fold higher than that of the corresponding amino metal-hydride complex (HMn–NH). Moreover, the hydrogenation of N-alkyl-substituted aldimines was realized using HMn–NLi as the active catalyst, whereas HMn–NH is much less effective. These results highlight the superiority of M/NM′ bifunctional catalysis over the classic M/NH bifunctional catalysis for hydrogenation reactions. Noyori-type hydrogenation catalysts consist of an N–H moiety coordinated to a metal centre. Now, a metal-hydride amidate complex (HMn–NLi) has been isolated and found to have superior reactivity and catalytic performance compared with the corresponding HMn–NH complex, highlighting the superiority of M/NM′ bifunctional catalysis over the classic M/NH bifunctional catalysis for hydrogenation reactions.

Ultra-fast intramolecular singlet fission to persistent multiexcitons by molecular design

Singlet fission—that is, the generation of two triplets from a lone singlet state—has recently resurfaced as a promising process for the generation of multiexcitons in organic systems. Although advances in this area have led to the discovery of modular classes of chromophores, controlling the fate of the multiexciton states has been a major challenge; for example, promoting fast multiexciton generation while maintaining long triplet lifetimes. Unravelling the dynamical evolution of the spin- and energy conversion processes from the transition of singlet excitons to correlated triplet pairs and individual triplet excitons is necessary to design materials that are optimized for translational technologies. Here, we engineer molecules featuring a discrete energy gradient that promotes the migration of strongly coupled triplet pairs to a spatially separated, weakly coupled state that readily dissociates into free triplets. This ’energy cleft’ concept allows us to combine the amplification and migration processes within a single molecule, with rapid dissociation of tightly bound triplet pairs into individual triplets that exhibit lifetimes of ~20 µs. Although they are synthetically tunable, organic molecules that undergo singlet fission (the generation of two excitons from one photon) have not demonstrated the excited-state properties necessary to improve optoelectronic devices. Now, a general ‘energy cleft’ molecular design scheme has been demonstrated that enables rapid generation and long lifetimes of multiple triplet excitons that are for device applications.

Discovery and evolution of RNA and XNA reverse transcriptase function and fidelity

The ability of reverse transcriptases (RTs) to synthesize a complementary DNA from natural RNA and a range of unnatural xeno nucleic acid (XNA) template chemistries, underpins key methods in molecular and synthetic genetics. However, RTs have proven challenging to discover and engineer, in particular for the more divergent XNA chemistries. Here we describe a general strategy for the directed evolution of RT function for any template chemistry called compartmentalized bead labelling and demonstrate it by the directed evolution of efficient RTs for 2′-O-methyl RNA and hexitol nucleic acids and the discovery of RTs for the orphan XNA chemistries d-altritol nucleic acid and 2′-methoxyethyl RNA, for which previously no RTs existed. Finally, we describe the engineering of XNA RTs with active exonucleolytic proofreading as well as the directed evolution of RNA RTs with very high complementary DNA synthesis fidelities, even in the absence of proofreading. Engineering reverse transcriptases for modified or unnatural nucleic acids is challenging, but now a versatile method has been developed that enables the discovery of efficient reverse transcriptases. The method works with a wide range of template structures, including xeno-nucleic acids and can also be used to produce high-fidelity reverse transcriptases for RNA.

Branched kissing loops for the construction of diverse RNA homooligomeric nanostructures

In biological systems, large and complex structures are often assembled from multiple simpler identical subunits. This strategy—homooligomerization—allows efficient genetic encoding of structures and avoids the need to control the stoichiometry of multiple distinct units. It also allows the minimal number of distinct subunits when designing artificial nucleic acid structures. Here, we present a robust self-assembly system in which homooligomerizable tiles are formed from intramolecularly folded RNA single strands. Tiles are linked through an artificially designed branched kissing-loop motif, involving Watson–Crick base pairing between the single-stranded regions of a bulged helix and a hairpin loop. By adjusting the tile geometry to gain control over the curvature, torsion and the number of helices, we have constructed 16 different linear and circular structures, including a finite-sized three-dimensional cage. We further demonstrate cotranscriptional self-assembly of tiles based on branched kissing loops, and show that tiles inserted into a transfer RNA scaffold can be overexpressed in bacterial cells. Homooligomerization systems can be used to construct nanoarchitectures and to aid understanding of natural analogues. But the formation of such artificial systems with structural diversity and complexity comparable to that of biological systems is challenging. Now, an artificial branched kissing-loop motif has been designed, which links tiles folded from a single strand of RNA to give diverse homooligomeric nanostructures.

Direct observation of forward-scattering oscillations in the H+HD→H2+D reaction

Accurate measurements of product state-resolved angular distributions are central to fundamental studies of chemical reaction dynamics. Yet, fine quantum-mechanical structures in product angular distributions of a reactive scattering process, such as the fast oscillations in the forward-scattering direction, have never been observed experimentally and the nature of these oscillations has not been fully explored. Here we report the crossed-molecular-beam experimental observation of these fast forward-scattering oscillations in the product angular distribution of the benchmark chemical reaction, H + HD → H2 + D. Clear oscillatory structures are observed for the H2(v′ = 0, j′ = 1, 3) product states at a collision energy of 1.35 eV, in excellent agreement with the quantum-mechanical dynamics calculations. Our analysis reveals that the oscillatory forward-scattering components are mainly contributed by the total angular momentum J around 28. The partial waves and impact parameters responsible for the forward scatterings are also determined from these observed oscillations, providing crucial dynamics information on the transient reaction process. Our understanding of reaction dynamics has developed as more accurate measurements of product state-resolved angular distributions have become available. Now, fast forward-scattering oscillations in the product angular distribution of the benchmark chemical reaction H + HD → H2 + D have been observed and are in excellent agreement with quantum-mechanical dynamics calculations.

Bifunctional sulfilimines enable synthesis of multiple N-heterocycles from alkenes

Intramolecular cyclization of nitrogen-containing molecules onto pendant alkenes is an efficient strategy for the construction of N-heterocycles, which are of paramount importance in, for example, pharmaceuticals and materials. Similar intermolecular cyclization reactions, however, are scarcer for nitrogen building blocks, including N-centred radicals, and divergent and modular versions are not established. Here we report the use of sulfilimines as bifunctional N-radical precursors for cyclization reactions with alkenes to produce N-unprotected heterocycles in a single step through photoredox catalysis. Structurally diverse sulfilimines can be synthesized in a single step, and subsequently engage with alkenes to afford synthetically valuable five-, six- and seven-membered heterocycles. The broad and diverse scope is achievable by a radical-polar crossover annulation enabled by the bifunctional character of the reagents, which distinguishes itself from all other N-centred-radical-based reactions. The modular synthesis of the sulfilimines allows for larger structural diversity of N-heterocycle products than is currently achievable with other single cyclization methods. Intermolecular cyclization reactions using nitrogen-containing building blocks are scarce. Now, bifunctional sulfilimines have been shown to enable the modular construction of a diverse range of N-heterocycles by reacting with alkenes in a single photocatalysed step. Both sulfilimines and alkenes are easily accessible, providing access to a wide range of N-heterocycles with different ring types, ring sizes and substituents on the skeleton.

Diastereo- and enantioselective synthesis of compounds with a trifluoromethyl- and fluoro-substituted carbon centre

Molecules that contain one or more fluorine atoms are crucial to drug discovery. There are protocols available for the selective synthesis of different organofluorine compounds, including those with a fluoro-substituted or a trifluoromethyl-substituted stereogenic carbon centre. However, approaches for synthesizing compounds with a trifluoromethyl- and fluoro-substituent stereogenic carbon centre are far less common. This potentially impactful set of molecules thus remains severely underdeveloped. Here we introduce a catalytic regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective strategy for the preparation of homoallylic alcohols bearing a stereogenic carbon centre bound to a trifluoromethyl group and a fluorine atom. The process, which involves a polyfluoroallyl boronate and is catalysed by an in situ-formed organozinc complex, can be used for diastereodivergent preparation of tetrafluoro-monosaccharides, including ribose core analogues of the antiviral drug sofosbuvir (Sovaldi). Unexpected reactivity/selectivity profiles, probably originating from the trifluoromethyl- and fluoro-substituted carbon site, are discovered, foreshadowing other unique chemistries that remain unknown. Methods to access organofluorine compounds with a trifluoromethyl- and fluoro-substituted carbon stereogenic centre are severely limited. Now, a flexible and stereodivergent approach has been developed for the efficient preparation of homoallylic alcohols containing this moiety. Conversion to polyfluoro furanosides and pyranosides has been demonstrated, which is relevant to antiviral drug development.

Title: 
The dynamics of agonist-β2-adrenergic receptor activation induced by binding of GDP-bound Gs protein

There is considerable uncertainty about the mechanism by which the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is activated. Here we use molecular metadynamics computations to predict the mechanism by which an agonist induces the activation of the β2AR and its cognate Gs protein. We found that binding agonist alone to the inactive β2AR does not break the ionic lock and hence does not drive the β2AR towards the activated conformation. However, we found that attaching the inactive Gs protein to the agonist-bound inactive β2AR (containing the ionic lock) leads to partial insertion of Gαs-α5 into the core of β2AR, which breaks the ionic lock, leading to activation of the Gs protein coupled to β2AR. Upon activation, the Gαs protein undergoes a remarkable opening of the GDP binding pocket, making the GDP available for exchange or release. Concomitantly, Gαs-α5 undergoes a remarkable expansion in the β2AR cytoplasmic region after the ionic lock is broken, inducing TM6 to displace outward by ~5 Å from TM3. Contrary to agonist binding being the sole driver for β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) activation, molecular metadynamics simulations now reveal a distinct activation mechanism. Coupling β2AR with its cognate Gs protein induces considerable structural changes, activating both proteins. Gs opens its GDP binding pocket while β2AR undergoes expansion.

Crystal phase-based epitaxial growth of hybrid noble metal nanostructures on 4H/fcc Au nanowires

Crystal-phase engineering offers opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of noble metal nanomaterials with unusual crystal phases that normally do not exist in bulk materials. However, it remains a challenge to use these materials as seeds to construct heterometallic nanostructures with desired crystal phases and morphologies for promising applications such as catalysis. Here, we report a strategy for the synthesis of binary and ternary hybrid noble metal nanostructures. Our synthesized crystal-phase heterostructured 4H/fcc Au nanowires enable the epitaxial growth of Ru nanorods on the 4H phase and fcc-twin boundary in Au nanowires, resulting in hybrid Au–Ru nanowires. Moreover, the method can be extended to the epitaxial growth of Rh, Ru–Rh and Ru–Pt nanorods on the 4H/fcc Au nanowires to form unique hybrid nanowires. Importantly, the Au–Ru hybrid nanowires with tunable compositions exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Heterometallic nanomaterials in unusual crystal phases that are impossible to form in the bulk state can show interesting physical and chemical properties. Here, crystal-phase heterostructured 4H/fcc Au nanowires are used as seeds to epitaxially grow a variety of binary and ternary hybrid noble metal nanostructures on the phase boundary.

Switching the magnetic hysteresis of an [Feii–NC–Wv]-based coordination polymer by photoinduced reversible spin crossover

Magnetic bistable materials that feature magnetic hysteresis are comparable to elementary binary units and promising for application in switches and memory devices. In this work, we report a material that consists of parallel cyanide-bridged [Feii–Wv] coordination chains linked together through rigid bis(imidazolyl)–benzene ligands and displays multiple magnetic states. The paramagnetic high-spin and diamagnetic low-spin states of the spin-crossover Feii ions can be interconverted by reversible light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) by alternating between light irradiation of 808 and 473 nm. At 1.8 K, under 808-nm-light irradiation, magnetic interactions between the photogenerated paramagnetic high-spin Feii centres and the Wv centres lead to long fragments that exhibit single-chain magnet behaviour, with a wide magnetic hysteresis and a large coercive field of 19 kOe; under a 473 nm light, isolated Feii–Wv fragments behave as single-molecule magnets instead. At 3.3 K, the high-spin form still displays magnetic hysteresis, albeit narrower, whereas the low-spin one does not. Photoinduced spin crossover offers a convenient handle on the spin states and magnetic interactions within a material, which is promising for the development of photoresponsive nanomagnets. Now, a Wv–CN–Feii-based coordination polymer has been prepared that behaves either as a single-chain magnet or as single-molecule magnets under different light irradiations. Its magnetic hysteresis can also be switched on and off.

Dynamic covalent self-assembly of mechanically interlocked molecules solely made from peptides

Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), such as rotaxanes and catenanes, have captured the attention of chemists both from a synthetic perspective and because of their role as simple prototypes of molecular machines. Although examples exist in nature, most synthetic MIMs are made from artificial building blocks and assembled in organic solvents. The synthesis of MIMs from natural biomolecules remains highly challenging. Here, we report on a synthesis strategy for interlocked molecules solely made from peptides, that is, mechanically interlocked peptides (MIPs). Fully peptidic, cysteine-decorated building blocks were self-assembled in water to generate disulfide-bonded dynamic combinatorial libraries consisting of multiple different rotaxanes, catenanes and daisy chains as well as more exotic structures. Detailed NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry characterization of a [2]catenane comprising two peptide macrocycles revealed that this structure has rich conformational dynamics reminiscent of protein folding. Thus, MIPs can serve as a bridge between fully synthetic MIMs and those found in nature. The construction of mechanically interlocked molecules solely made from peptides is a great synthetic challenge because of a lack of effective templating strategies. Now it has been shown that by combining self-assembly and dynamic covalent chemistry, catenanes, daisy chains and other interlocked peptides can be synthesized from genetically engineered building blocks.

Title: 
Dynamic self-correcting nucleophilic aromatic substitution

Dynamic covalent chemistry, with its ability to correct synthetic dead-ends, allows for the synthesis of elaborate extended network materials in high yields. However, the limited number of reactions amenable to dynamic covalent chemistry necessarily confines the scope and functionality of materials synthesized. Here, we explore the dynamic and self-correcting nature of nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr), using ortho-aryldithiols and ortho-aryldifluorides that condense to produce redox-active thianthrene units. We demonstrate the facile construction of two-, three- and four-point junctions by reaction between a dithiol nucleophile and three different model electrophiles that produces molecules with two, three and four thianthrene moieties, respectively, in excellent yields. The regioselectivity observed is driven by thermodynamics; other connections form under kinetic control. We also show that the same chemistry can be extended to the synthesis of novel ladder macrocycles and porous polymer networks with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of up to 813 m2 g−1. Dynamic covalent chemistry offers promise for the formation of elaborate extended network materials in high yields, but the limited number of reactions available confines the scope and functionality of the materials synthesized. Now, nucleophilic aromatic substitution has been shown to be reversible, and thus self-correcting, enabling the easy synthesis of sulfur-rich materials.

A catalytic asymmetric cross-coupling approach to the synthesis of cyclobutanes

Stereodefined four-membered rings are common motifs in bioactive molecules and versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. However, the synthesis of complex, chiral cyclobutanes is a largely unsolved problem and there is a need for general and modular synthetic methods. Here we report a series of asymmetric cross-coupling reactions between cyclobutenes and arylboronic acids which are initiated by Rh-catalysed asymmetric carbometallation. After the initial carborhodation, Rh–cyclobutyl intermediates undergo chain-walking or C–H insertion so that overall a variety of additions such as reductive Heck reactions, 1,5-addition and homoallylic substitution are observed. The synthetic applicability of these highly stereoselective transformations is demonstrated in the concise syntheses of the drug candidates Belaperidone and PF-04862853. We anticipate this approach will be widely adopted by synthetic and medicinal chemists. While the carbometallation approach reported here is exemplified with Rh and arylboronic acids, it is likely to be applicable to other metals and nucleophiles. Complex substituted cyclobutanes are common motifs in bioactive molecules but are difficult to make enantioselectively. Now, it has been shown that cross-coupling reactions between cyclobutenes and arylboronic acids—initiated by Rh-catalysed asymmetric carbometallation—can provide access to a diverse range of chiral cyclobutanes.

Targeted photoredox catalysis in cancer cells

Hypoxic tumours are a major problem for cancer photodynamic therapy. Here, we show that photoredox catalysis can provide an oxygen-independent mechanism of action to combat this problem. We have designed a highly oxidative Ir(iii) photocatalyst, [Ir(ttpy)(pq)Cl]PF6 ([1]PF6, where ‘ttpy’ represents 4′-(p-tolyl)-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine and ‘pq’ represents 3-phenylisoquinoline), which is phototoxic towards both normoxic and hypoxic cancer cells. Complex 1 photocatalytically oxidizes 1,4-dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)—an important coenzyme in living cells—generating NAD• radicals with a high turnover frequency in biological media. Moreover, complex 1 and NADH synergistically photoreduce cytochrome c under hypoxia. Density functional theory calculations reveal π stacking in adducts of complex 1 and NADH, facilitating photoinduced single-electron transfer. In cancer cells, complex 1 localizes in mitochondria and disrupts electron transport via NADH photocatalysis. On light irradiation, complex 1 induces NADH depletion, intracellular redox imbalance and immunogenic apoptotic cancer cell death. This photocatalytic redox imbalance strategy offers a new approach for efficient cancer phototherapy. Current photodynamic therapy photosensitizers require oxygen; however, tumours are often hypoxic. Now, an organoiridium complex with an unusually high redox potential, which is effective in normoxia and hypoxia, has been developed. The organoiridium complex kills cancer cells by an immunogenic apoptotic mechanism involving efficient photocatalytic oxidation of NADH to NAD radicals, and reduction of cytochrome c.

Infrared spectroscopy reveals multi-step multi-timescale photoactivation in the photoconvertible protein archetype dronpa

Photochromic fluorescent proteins play key roles in super-resolution microscopy and optogenetics. The light-driven structural changes that modulate the fluorescence involve both trans-to-cis isomerization and proton transfer. The mechanism, timescale and relative contribution of chromophore and protein dynamics are currently not well understood. Here, the mechanism of off-to-on-state switching in dronpa is studied using femtosecond-to-millisecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and isotope labelling. Chromophore and protein dynamics are shown to occur on multiple timescales, from picoseconds to hundreds of microseconds. Following excitation of the trans chromophore, a ground-state primary product is formed within picoseconds. Surprisingly, the characteristic vibrational spectrum of the neutral cis isomer appears only after several tens of nanoseconds. Further fluctuations in protein structure around the neutral cis chromophore are required to form a new intermediate, which promotes the final proton-transfer reaction. These data illustrate the interplay between chromophore dynamics and the protein environment underlying fluorescent protein photochromism. Understanding the mechanism of photoconversion in fluorescent proteins is essential to optimizing applications in imaging and optogenetics. It has now been demonstrated that photoconversion in the photoswitchable protein dronpa follows a multi-step mechanism, with both chromophore and protein structural dynamics occurring on multiple timescales from picoseconds to hundreds of microseconds.

Atomic control of active-site ensembles in ordered alloys to enhance hydrogenation selectivity

Intermetallic compounds offer unique opportunities for atom-by-atom manipulation of catalytic ensembles through precise stoichiometric control. The (Pd, M, Zn) γ-brass phase enables the controlled synthesis of Pd–M–Pd catalytic sites (M = Zn, Pd, Cu, Ag and Au) isolated in an inert Zn matrix. These multi-atom heteronuclear active sites are catalytically distinct from Pd single atoms and fully coordinated Pd. Here we quantify the unexpectedly large effect that active-site composition (that is, identity of the M atom in Pd–M–Pd sites) has on ethylene selectivity during acetylene semihydrogenation. Subtle stoichiometric control demonstrates that Pd–Pd–Pd sites are active for ethylene hydrogenation, whereas Pd–Zn–Pd sites show no measurable ethylene-to-ethane conversion. Agreement between experimental and density-functional-theory-predicted activities and selectivities demonstrates precise control of Pd–M–Pd active-site composition. This work demonstrates that the diversity and well-defined structure of intermetallics can be used to design active sites assembled with atomic-level precision. Advances in the design of heterogeneous catalysts are limited by our ability to synthesize atomically precise active-site ensembles. Now, the controlled synthesis of Pd–M–Pd catalytic sites (M = Zn, Pd, Cu, Ag and Au) has been demonstrated. Stoichiometric control identifies that Pd–Pd–Pd sites are active for ethylene hydrogenation, whereas Pd–Zn–Pd sites are not.

The reductive C3 functionalization of pyridinium and quinolinium salts through iridium-catalysed interrupted transfer hydrogenation

Aromatic rings are ubiquitous in organic chemistry and form the basis of many commercial products. Despite the numerous routes available for the preparation of aromatic compounds, there remain few methods that allow their conversion into synthetically useful partially saturated derivatives and even fewer that allow new C–C bonds to be formed at the same time. Here we set out to address this problem and uncover a unique catalytic partial reduction reaction that forms partially saturated azaheterocycles from aromatic precursors. In this reaction, methanol and formaldehyde are used for the reductive functionalization of pyridines and quinolines using catalytic iridium; thus, inexpensive and renewable feedstocks are utilized in the formation of complex N-heterocycles. By harnessing the formation of a nucleophilic enamine intermediate, the C–C bond-forming process reverses the normal pattern of reactivity and allows access to the C3 position of the arene. Mechanistic investigations using D-labelling experiments reveal the source of hydride added to the ring and show the reversible nature of the iridium-hydride addition. The concept of ‘interrupted transfer hydrogenation’ is presented, allowing the reductive hydroxymethylation of pyridinium and quinolinium salts at the C3 position. Mechanistic studies show the reaction occurs through an initial reversible iridium hydride reduction, followed by trapping of an enamine generated in situ before a final irreversible iridium-hydride reduction.

Metalloradical approach for concurrent control in intermolecular radical allylic C−H amination

Although they offer great potentials, the high reactivity and diverse pathways of radical chemistry pose difficult problems for applications in organic synthesis. In addition to the differentiation of multiple competing pathways, the control of various selectivities in radical reactions presents both formidable challenges and great opportunities. To regulate chemoselectivity and regioselectivity, as well as diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, calls for the formulation of conceptually new approaches and fundamentally different governing principles. Here we show that Co(II)-based metalloradical catalysis enables the radical chemoselective intermolecular amination of allylic C−H bonds through the employment of modularly designed D2-symmetric chiral amidoporphyrins with a tunable pocket-like environment as the supporting ligand. The reaction exhibits a remarkable convergence of regioselectivity, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity in a single catalytic operation. In addition to demonstrating the unique opportunities of metalloradical catalysis in controlling homolytic radical reactions, the Co(II)-catalysed convergent C–H amination offers a route to synthesize valuable chiral α-tertiary amines directly from an isomeric mixture of alkenes. Controlling various selectivities in radical reactions presents both formidable challenges and great opportunities. Now, Co(II)-based metalloradical catalysis has enabled the concurrent control of multiple convergences and selectivities in intermolecular radical allylic C−H amination. The reaction provides access to valuable chiral α-tertiary amines directly from an isomeric mixture of alkenes.

A molecular endless (74) knot

Current strategies for the synthesis of molecular knots focus on twisting, folding and/or threading molecular building blocks. Here we report that Zn(ii) or Fe(ii) ions can be used to weave ligand strands to form a woven 3 × 3 molecular grid. We found that the process requires tetrafluoroborate anions to template the assembly of the interwoven grid by binding within the square cavities formed between the metal-coordinated criss-crossed ligands. The strand ends of the grid can subsequently be joined through within-grid alkene metathesis reactions to form a topologically trivial macrocycle (unknot), a doubly interlocked [2]catenane (Solomon link) and a knot with seven crossings in a 258-atom-long closed loop. This 74 knot topology corresponds to that of an endless knot, which is a basic motif of Celtic interlace, the smallest Chinese knot and one of the eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism and Hinduism. The weaving of molecular strands within a discrete layer by anion-template metal–ion coordination opens the way for the synthesis of other molecular knot topologies and to woven polymer materials. A combination of metal- and anion-template synthesis directs the weaving of molecular weft and warp strands in the assembly of a 3 × 3 interwoven grid. Connection of the ligand strands by alkene metathesis produces the topology of a seven-crossing endless knot, an important cultural and religious symbol.

Engineered triply orthogonal pyrrolysyl–tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs enable the genetic encoding of three distinct non-canonical amino acids

Expanding and reprogramming the genetic code of cells for the incorporation of multiple distinct non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), and the encoded biosynthesis of non-canonical biopolymers, requires the discovery of multiple orthogonal aminoacyl–transfer RNA synthetase/tRNA pairs. These pairs must be orthogonal to both the host synthetases and tRNAs and to each other. Pyrrolysyl–tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/PyltRNA pairs are the most widely used system for genetic code expansion. Here, we reveal that the sequences of ΔNPylRS/ΔNPyltRNA pairs (which lack N-terminal domains) form two distinct classes. We show that the measured specificities of the ΔNPylRSs and ΔNPyltRNAs correlate with sequence-based clustering, and most ΔNPylRSs preferentially function with ΔNPyltRNAs from their class. We then identify 18 mutually orthogonal pairs from the 88 ΔNPylRS/ΔNPyltRNA combinations tested. Moreover, we generate a set of 12 triply orthogonal pairs, each composed of three new PylRS/PyltRNA pairs. Finally, we diverge the ncAA specificity and decoding properties of each pair, within a triply orthogonal set, and direct the incorporation of three distinct non-canonical amino acids into a single polypeptide. Non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) can be incorporated into proteins in cells using orthogonal aminaocyl–tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs; the most widely adopted system is based on a pyrrolysyl–tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNA pair. Now, three new PylRS/tRNA pairs have been developed that are mutually orthogonal and can be used together to site-specifically incorporate three distinct ncAAs into a single protein.

A mating mechanism to generate diversity for the Darwinian selection of DNA-encoded synthetic molecules

DNA-encoded library technologies enable the screening of synthetic molecules but have thus far not tapped into the power of Darwinian selection with iterative cycles of selection, amplification and diversification. Here we report a simple strategy to rapidly assemble libraries of conformationally constrained peptides that are paired in a combinatorial fashion (suprabodies). We demonstrate that the pairing can be shuffled after each amplification cycle in a process similar to DNA shuffling or mating to regenerate diversity. Using simulations, we show the benefits of this recombination in yielding a more accurate correlation of selection fitness with affinity after multiple rounds of selection, particularly if the starting library is heterogeneous in the concentration of its members. The method was validated with selections against streptavidin and applied to the discovery of PD-L1 binders. We further demonstrate that the binding of self-assembled suprabodies can be recapitulated by smaller (∼7 kDa) synthetic products that maintain the conformational constraint of the peptides. DNA-encoded libraries facilitate the discovery of ligands that interact with biomolecules but such technologies do not take full advantage of the principles of Darwinian selection. Now, libraries of conformationally constrained peptides (Dsuprabodies) have been assembled using a strategy that allows for iterative cycles of selection, amplification and diversification. This method was validated with selections against streptavidin and PD-L1.

Quantum machine learning using atom-in-molecule-based fragments selected on the fly

First-principles-based exploration of chemical space deepens our understanding of chemistry and might help with the design of new molecules, materials or experiments. Due to the computational cost of quantum chemistry methods and the immense number of theoretically possible stable compounds, comprehensive in silico screening remains prohibitive. To overcome this challenge, we combine atom-in-molecule-based fragments, dubbed ‘amons’ (A), with active learning in transferable quantum machine learning (ML) models. The efficiency, accuracy, scalability and transferability of the resulting AML models is demonstrated for important molecular quantum properties such as energies, forces, atomic charges, NMR shifts and polarizabilities and for systems including organic molecules, 2D materials, water clusters, Watson–Crick DNA base pairs and even ubiquitin. Conceptually, the AML approach extends Mendeleev’s table to account effectively for chemical environments, which allows the systematic reconstruction of many chemistries from local building blocks. Quantum machine learning with improved data efficiency and transferability has been achieved using on-the-fly selection of query-dependent training molecules, which are drawn from a ‘dictionary’ of atom-in-molecule-based fragments. The benefits of the resulting models have been demonstrated for important molecular properties and for systems including organic molecules, 2D materials, water clusters, DNA base pairs and ubiquitin.

Title: 
Dual chemical probes enable quantitative system-wide analysis of protein prenylation and prenylation dynamics

Post-translational farnesylation or geranylgeranylation at a C-terminal cysteine residue regulates the localization and function of over 100 proteins, including the Ras isoforms, and is a therapeutic target in diseases including cancer and infection. Here, we report global and selective profiling of prenylated proteins in living cells enabled by the development of isoprenoid analogues YnF and YnGG in combination with quantitative chemical proteomics. Eighty prenylated proteins were identified in a single human cell line, 64 for the first time at endogenous abundance without metabolic perturbation. We further demonstrate that YnF and YnGG enable direct identification of post-translationally processed prenylated peptides, proteome-wide quantitative analysis of prenylation dynamics and alternative prenylation in response to four different prenyltransferase inhibitors, and quantification of defective Rab prenylation in a model of the retinal degenerative disease choroideremia. Two chemical probes, YnF and YnGG, that enable the identification of prenylated peptides and global analysis of protein prenylation using quantitative chemical proteomics have now been developed. Prenylation dynamics in response to pharmacological inhibition of prenyl-transferase enzymes were also studied. As a final demonstration, defective Rab prenylation in a model of the retinal degenerative disease choroideremia was also quantified.

Isolation, synthesis and bioactivity studies of phomactin terpenoids

Studies of secondary metabolites (natural products) that cover their isolation, chemical synthesis and bioactivity investigation present myriad opportunities for discovery. For example, the isolation of novel secondary metabolites can inspire advances in chemical synthesis strategies to achieve their practical preparation for biological evaluation. In the process, chemical synthesis can also provide unambiguous structural characterization of the natural products. Although the isolation, chemical synthesis and bioactivity studies of natural products are mutually beneficial, they are often conducted independently. Here, we demonstrate the benefits of a collaborative study of the phomactins, diterpenoid fungal metabolites that serve as antagonists of the platelet activating factor receptor. Our isolation of novel phomactins has spurred the development of a bioinspired, unified approach that achieves the total syntheses of six congeners. We also demonstrate in vitro the beneficial effects of several phomactins in suppressing the rate of repopulation of tumour cells following gamma radiation therapy. Natural product chemistry remains critical to the discovery of small molecules that possess unique bioactivities. A collaborative approach to studying the phomactin diterpenoid family that spans isolation, chemical synthesis and investigation of their bioactivity is now reported. The novel congeners that were isolated inspired a divergent strategy to achieve their practical preparation and their anti-tumour evaluation.

Title: 
Capture of nitrogen dioxide and conversion to nitric acid in a porous metal–organic framework

Air pollution by nitrogen oxides, NOx, is a major problem, and new capture and abatement technologies are urgently required. Here, we report a metal–organic framework (Manchester Framework Material 520 (MFM-520)) that can efficiently confine dimers of NO2, which results in a high adsorption capacity of 4.2 mmol g–1 (298 K, 0.01 bar) with full reversibility and no loss of capacity over 125 cycles. Treatment of NO2@MFM-520 with water in air leads to a quantitative conversion of the captured NO2 into HNO3, an important feedstock for fertilizer production, and fully regenerates MFM-520. The confinement of N2O4 inside nanopores was established at a molecular level, and the dynamic breakthrough experiments using both dry and humid NO2 gas streams verify the excellent stability and selectivity of MFM-520 and confirm its potential for precious-metal-free deNOx technologies. Nitrogen oxides are major air pollutants; capture and abatement technologies exist but they typically involve toxic species or precious-metal catalysts. Now, a metal–organic framework has been shown to store NO2 dimers selectively, and to separate NO2 from other gases under wet conditions. Treatment with water in air leads to conversion of NO2 into HNO3—an important feedstock for fertilizer production—with full recovery of the host.

Title: 
Uniform segmented platelet micelles with compositionally distinct and selectively degradable cores

The creation of nanoparticles with controlled and uniform dimensions and spatially defined functionality is a key challenge. The recently developed living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) method has emerged as a promising route to one-dimensional (1D) and 2D core–shell micellar assemblies by seeded growth of polymeric and molecular amphiphiles. However, the general limitation of the epitaxial growth process to a single core-forming chemistry is an important obstacle to the creation of complex nanoparticles with segmented cores of spatially varied composition that can be subsequently exploited in selective transformations or responses to external stimuli. Here we report the successful use of a seeded growth approach that operates for a variety of different crystallizable polylactone homopolymer/block copolymer blend combinations to access 2D platelet micelles with compositionally distinct segmented cores. To illustrate the utility of controlling internal core chemistry, we demonstrate spatially selective hydrolytic degradation of the 2D platelets—a result that may be of interest for the design of complex stimuli-responsive particles for programmed-release and cargo-delivery applications. The synthesis of two-dimensional nanostructures with controlled dimensions from polymeric precursors remains challenging. Now, two-dimensional nanoparticles with chemically different spatially defined cores have been fabricated through seeded growth and are shown to undergo a programmable degradation process.

Title: 
Sustainable polyesters via direct functionalization of lignocellulosic sugars

The development of sustainable plastics from abundant renewable feedstocks has been limited by the complexity and efficiency of their production, as well as their lack of competitive material properties. Here we demonstrate the direct transformation of the hemicellulosic fraction of non-edible biomass into a tricyclic diester plastic precursor at 83% yield (95% from commercial xylose) during integrated plant fractionation with glyoxylic acid. Melt polycondensation of the resulting diester with a range of aliphatic diols led to amorphous polyesters (Mn = 30–60 kDa) with high glass transition temperatures (72–100 °C), tough mechanical properties (ultimate tensile strengths of 63–77 MPa, tensile moduli of 2,000–2,500 MPa and elongations at break of 50–80%) and strong gas barriers (oxygen transmission rates (100 µm) of 11–24 cc m−2 day−1 bar−1 and water vapour transmission rates (100 µm) of 25–36 g m−2 day−1) that could be processed by injection moulding, thermoforming, twin-screw extrusion and three-dimensional printing. Although standardized biodegradation studies still need to be performed, the inherently degradable nature of these materials facilitated their chemical recycling via methanolysis at 64 °C, and eventual depolymerization in room-temperature water. Functionalizing an intact carbohydrate core with acetals allows for the dramatically simplified production of a plastic precursor directly during the initial fractionation of non-edible biomass. When polymerized, the rigid and polar carbohydrate core also leads to bioplastics with competitive material and end-of life properties.

Title: 
Unusual peptide-binding proteins guide pyrroloindoline alkaloid formation in crocagin biosynthesis

Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products have provided many highly unusual scaffolds. This includes the intriguing alkaloids crocagins, which possess a tetracyclic core structure and whose biosynthesis has remained enigmatic. Here we use in vitro experiments to demonstrate that three proteins, CgnB, CgnC and CgnE, are sufficient for the production of the hallmark tetracyclic crocagin core from the precursor peptide CgnA. The crystal structures of the homologues CgnB and CgnE reveal them to be the founding members of a peptide-binding protein family and allow us to rationalize their distinct functions. We further show that the hydrolase CgnD liberates the crocagin core scaffold, which is subsequently N-methylated by CgnL. These insights allow us to propose a biosynthetic scheme for crocagins. Bioinformatic analyses based on these data led to the discovery of related biosynthetic pathways that may provide access to a structurally diverse family of peptide-derived pyrroloindoline alkaloids. The alkaloids crocagins are derived from a ribosomal peptide through a series of enzymatic post-translational modifications. A combination of biochemistry and structural biology techniques has now been used to elucidate this biosynthetic pathway, propose a mechanism for the formation of the tetracyclic core structure and enable genome mining for related natural products.

Title: 
Free-triplet generation with improved efficiency in tetracene oligomers through spatially separated triplet pair states

Singlet fission (SF) can potentially boost the efficiency of solar energy conversion by converting a singlet exciton (S1) into two free triplets (T1 + T1) through an intermediate state of a correlated triplet pair (TT). Although efficient TT generation has been recently realized in many intramolecular SF materials, their potential applications have been hindered by the poor efficiency of TT dissociation. Here we demonstrate that this can be overcome by employing a spatially separated 1(T…T) state with weak intertriplet coupling in tetracene oligomers with three or more chromophores. By using transient magneto-optical spectroscopic methods, we show that free-triplet generation can be markedly enhanced through the SF pathway that involves the spatially separated 1(T…T) state rather than the pathway mediated by the spatially adjacent TT state, leading to a marked improvement in free-triplet generation with an efficiency increase from 21% for the dimer to 85% (124%) for the trimer (tetramer). The overall efficiency of free-triplet generation from intramolecular singlet fission is limited by the efficiency of the dissociation of spatially adjacent triplet pairs. Now, using transient magneto-optical spectroscopy, it has been shown that this limitation can be overcome by promoting a pathway mediated by spatially separated triplet pairs in tetracene trimers and tetramers.

Title: 
From alkylarenes to anilines via site-directed carbon–carbon amination

Anilines are fundamental motifs in various chemical contexts, and are widely used in the industrial production of fine chemicals, polymers, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. A recent development for the synthesis of anilines uses the primary amination of C–H bonds in electron-rich arenes. However, there are limitations to this strategy: the amination of electron-deficient arenes remains a challenging task and the amination of electron-rich arenes has a limited control over regioselectivity—the formation of meta-aminated products is especially difficult. Here we report a site-directed C–C bond primary amination of simple and readily available alkylarenes or benzyl alcohols for the direct and efficient preparation of anilines. This chemistry involves a novel C–C bond transformation and offers a versatile protocol for the synthesis of substituted anilines. The use of O2 as an environmentally benign oxidant is demonstrated, and studies on model compounds suggest that this method may also be used for the depolymerization of lignin. Limitations associated with the primary amination of aryl C–H bonds include the poor control of regioselectivity with electron-rich substrates and the challenging nature of the reaction in the case of electron-deficient arenes. Now, site-directed C–C bond primary amination of simple alkylarenes and benzyl alcohols provides a route for the direct and efficient preparation of anilines.

Title: 
Interactions between nascent proteins and the ribosome surface inhibit co-translational folding

Most proteins begin to fold during biosynthesis on the ribosome. It has been suggested that interactions between the emerging polypeptide and the ribosome surface might allow the ribosome itself to modulate co-translational folding. Here we combine protein engineering and NMR spectroscopy to characterize a series of interactions between the ribosome surface and unfolded nascent chains of the immunoglobulin-like FLN5 filamin domain. The strongest interactions are found for a C-terminal segment that is essential for folding, and we demonstrate quantitative agreement between the strength of this interaction and the energetics of the co-translational folding process itself. Mutations in this region that reduce the extent of binding result in a shift in the co-translational folding equilibrium towards the native state. Our results therefore demonstrate that a competition between folding and binding provides a simple, dynamic mechanism for the modulation of co-translational folding by the ribosome. During polypeptide biosynthesis, a strong interaction can occur between a segment of an emerged, disordered nascent protein and the ribosomal surface. Now, it has been shown that competition between this ribosomal binding and the folding energetics of an immunoglobulin-like domain modulates the mechanism of co-translational folding.

Title: 
Stereocontrolled acyclic diene metathesis polymerization

The cis/trans geometry of olefins is known to dramatically influence the thermal and mechanical properties of polyalkenamers. Yet, polymerization methods that efficiently control this parameter are scarce. Here we report the development of a stereoretentive acyclic diene metathesis polymerization that uses the reactivity of dithiolate Ru carbenes combined with cis monomers. These Ru catalysts exhibit exquisite retention of the cis geometry and tolerate many polar functional groups, enabling the synthesis of all-cis polyesters, polycarbonates, polyethers and polysulfites. The stereoretentive acyclic diene metathesis polymerization is also characterized by low catalyst loadings and tolerance towards trans impurities in the monomer batch, which should facilitate large-scale implementation. Modulation of the reaction temperature and time leads to an erosion of stereoretention, permitting a stereocontrolled synthesis of polyalkenamers with predictable cis:trans ratios. The impact of the stereochemistry of the repeating alkenes on the thermal properties is clearly demonstrated through differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. Polymerization methods that control the cis/trans stereochemistry of repeating alkenes in polyalkenamers remain scarce. Now, an acyclic diene metathesis process has been developed that enables control over the stereochemistry of the polymer backbone. The method harnesses the reactivity of dithiolate Ru carbenes, in combination with cis,cis-diene monomers, to access several classes of polymers with tailored properties.

Title: 
Metal–organic frameworks embedded in a liposome facilitate overall photocatalytic water splitting

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied extensively in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the water oxidation reaction (WOR) with sacrificial reagents, but overall photocatalytic water splitting using MOFs has remained challenging, principally because of the fast recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. Here we have integrated HER- and WOR-MOF nanosheets into liposomal structures for separation of the generated charges. The HER-MOF nanosheets comprise light-harvesting Zn–porphyrin and catalytic Pt–porphyrin moieties, and are functionalized with hydrophobic groups to facilitate their incorporation into the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of the liposome. The WOR-MOF flakes consist of [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)3]2+-based photosensitizers and Ir–bipyridine catalytic centres, and are localized in the hydrophilic interior of the liposome. This liposome–MOF assembly achieves overall photocatalytic water splitting with an apparent quantum yield of (1.5 ± 1)% as a result of ultrafast electron transport from the antennae (Zn–porphyrin and [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)3]2+) to the reaction centres (Pt–porphyrin and Ir–bipyridine) in the MOFs and efficient charge separation in the lipid bilayers. Some metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can promote photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and others can facilitate water oxidation, but it is difficult to combine them into a single system. Now, by confining MOFs that can promote each half-reaction within the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of a liposome to avoid the fast recombination of photo-generated charges, evidence for water splitting has been obtained.

Title: 
Diverse compounds from pleuromutilin lead to a thioredoxin inhibitor and inducer of ferroptosis

The chemical diversification of natural products provides a robust and general method for the creation of stereochemically rich and structurally diverse small molecules. The resulting compounds have physicochemical traits different from those in most screening collections, and as such are an excellent source for biological discovery. Herein, we subject the diterpene natural product pleuromutilin to reaction sequences focused on creating ring system diversity in few synthetic steps. This effort resulted in a collection of compounds with previously unreported ring systems, providing a novel set of structurally diverse and highly complex compounds suitable for screening in a variety of different settings. Biological evaluation identified the novel compound ferroptocide, a small molecule that rapidly and robustly induces ferroptotic death of cancer cells. Target identification efforts and CRISPR knockout studies reveal that ferroptocide is an inhibitor of thioredoxin, a key component of the antioxidant system in the cell. Ferroptocide positively modulates the immune system in a murine model of breast cancer and will be a useful tool to study the utility of pro-ferroptotic agents for treatment of cancer. A set of stereochemically complex and structurally diverse compounds were created from the diterpene natural product pleuromutilin using the complexity-to-diversity strategy. Phenotypic screening identified a compound that induces rapid ferroptotic death of cancer cells. Experiments to probe the mechanism revealed the compound to be an inhibitor of thioredoxin.

Title: 
Reversible C–C bond formation using palladium catalysis

A widely appreciated principle is that all reactions are fundamentally reversible. Observing reversible transition metal-catalysed reactions, particularly those that include the cleavage of C–C bonds, is more challenging. The development of palladium- and nickel-catalysed carboiodination reactions afforded access to the cis and trans diastereomers of the iodo-dihydroisoquinolone products. Using these substrates, an extensive study investigating the reversibility of C–C bond formation using a simple palladium catalyst was undertaken. Herein we report a comprehensive investigation of reversible C–C bond formation using palladium catalysis employing diastereomeric neopentyl iodides as the starting point. It was shown that both diastereomers could be converted to a common product under identical catalytic conditions. A combination of experimental and computational studies were used to probe the operative mechanism. A variety of concepts key to understanding the process of reversible C–C bond formations were investigated, including the effect of electronic and steric parameters on the C–C bond-cleavage step. Although carbometallation reactions have been thoroughly investigated, understanding the factors responsible for the reverse reaction (β-carbon elimination) is an emerging area of research. Now, a series of substrates has been investigated to study the key factors that promote β-carbon elimination under palladium catalysis.

Title: 
Lewis acid-assisted reduction of nitrite to nitric and nitrous oxides via the elusive nitrite radical dianion

Reduction of nitrite anions (NO2−) to nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ultimately dinitrogen (N2) takes place in a variety of environments, including in the soil as part of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle and in acidified nuclear waste. Nitrite reduction typically takes place within the coordination sphere of a redox-active transition metal. Here we show that Lewis acid coordination can substantially modify the reduction potential of this polyoxoanion to allow for its reduction under non-aqueous conditions (−0.74 V versus NHE). Detailed characterization confirms the formation of the borane-capped radical nitrite dianion (NO22−), which features a N(II) oxidation state. Protonation of the nitrite dianion results in the facile loss of nitric oxide (NO), whereas its reaction with NO results in disproportionation to nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrite (NO2−). This system connects three redox levels in the global nitrogen cycle and provides fundamental insights into the conversion of NO2− to NO. The reduction of nitrite (NO2−) to nitric oxide (NO), relevant to the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle as well as radioactive waste, typically occurs at redox-active metal centres. Now, a Lewis acid-capped nitrite has been reduced to the nitrite dianion (NO22−), a nitrogen-centred radical that connects three redox levels in the global nitrogen cycle through NO2−, NO and N2O.

The merger of decatungstate and copper catalysis to enable aliphatic C(sp3)–H trifluoromethylation

The introduction of a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group can dramatically improve a compound’s biological properties. Despite the well-established importance of trifluoromethylated compounds, general methods for the trifluoromethylation of alkyl C–H bonds remain elusive. Here we report the development of a dual-catalytic C(sp3)–H trifluoromethylation through the merger of light-driven, decatungstate-catalysed hydrogen atom transfer and copper catalysis. This metallaphotoredox methodology enables the direct conversion of both strong aliphatic and benzylic C–H bonds into the corresponding C(sp3)–CF3 products in a single step using a bench-stable, commercially available trifluoromethylation reagent. The reaction requires only a single equivalent of substrate and proceeds with excellent selectivity for positions distal to unprotected amines. To demonstrate the utility of this new methodology for late-stage functionalization, we have directly derivatized a broad range of approved drugs and natural products to generate valuable trifluoromethylated analogues. Preliminary mechanistic experiments reveal that a ‘Cu–CF3’ species is formed during this process and the critical C(sp3)–CF3 bond-forming step involves the copper catalyst. Despite the importance of trifluoromethylated compounds, direct catalytic methods for the conversion of C(sp3)–H bonds into the corresponding C(sp3)–CF3 analogues have remained elusive. This transformation has now been achieved by the merger of copper catalysis with decatungstate photocatalysis, enabling the C(sp3)–H trifluoromethylation of abundant feedstocks, natural products and pharmaceuticals.

Condensates in RNA repeat sequences are heterogeneously organized and exhibit reptation dynamics

Although it is known that RNA undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation, the interplay between the molecular driving forces and the emergent features of the condensates, such as their morphologies and dynamic properties, is not well understood. We introduce a coarse-grained model to simulate phase separation of trinucleotide repeat RNAs, which are implicated in neurological disorders. After establishing that the simulations reproduce key experimental findings, we show that once recruited inside the liquid droplets, the monomers transition from hairpin-like structures to extended states. Interactions between the monomers in the condensates result in the formation of an intricate and dense intermolecular network, which severely restrains the fluctuations and mobilities of the RNAs inside large droplets. In the largest densely packed high-viscosity droplets, the mobility of RNA chains is best characterized by reptation, reminiscent of the dynamics in polymer melts. Our work provides a microscopic framework for understanding liquid–liquid phase separation in RNA, which is not easily discernible in current experiments. The molecular driving forces underlying the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of RNA are not well understood. Now simulations show that low-complexity RNA sequences undergo LLPS at high RNA concentrations, driven by the formation of Watson–Crick base pairs between distinct RNA polymers. LLPS occurs by merger of small droplets into larger ones and RNA chains in the large droplets exhibit reptation dynamics.

Photosensitized oxidative addition to gold(i) enables alkynylative cyclization of o-alkylnylphenols with iodoalkynes

The well-established oxidative addition–reductive elimination pathway is the most followed one in transition metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. While readily occurring with a series of transition metals, gold(i) complexes have shown some reluctance to undergo oxidative addition unless special sets of ligands on gold(i), reagents or reaction conditions are used. Here we show that under visible-light irradiation, an iridium photocatalyst triggers—via triplet sensitization—the oxidative addition of an alkynyl iodide onto a vinylgold(i) intermediate to deliver C(sp)2–C(sp) coupling products after reductive elimination. Mechanistic and modelling studies support that an energy-transfer event takes place, rather than a redox pathway. This particular mode of activation in gold homogenous catalysis was applied in several dual catalytic processes. Alkynylbenzofuran derivatives were obtained from o-alkynylphenols and iodoalkynes in the presence of catalytic gold(i) and iridium(iii) complexes under blue light-emitting diode irradiation. Studies into gold-catalysed cross-coupling reactions have expanded over recent decades; however, oxidative addition to gold(i) complexes remains challenging. Now it has been shown that a dual catalytic transformation involving iridium photosensitization to trigger oxidative addition to organogold intermediates enables C(sp2)–C(sp) cross-coupling reactions that are useful for the alkynylation of benzofurans.

Chemoenzymatic synthesis of fluorinated polyketides

Modification of polyketides with fluorine offers a promising approach to develop new pharmaceuticals. While synthetic chemical methods for site-selective incorporation of fluorine in complex molecules have improved in recent years, approaches for the biosynthetic incorporation of fluorine in natural compounds are still rare. Here, we report a strategy to introduce fluorine into complex polyketides during biosynthesis. We exchanged the native acyltransferase domain of a polyketide synthase, which acts as the gatekeeper for the selection of extender units, with an evolutionarily related but substrate tolerant domain from metazoan type I fatty acid synthase. The resulting polyketide-synthase/fatty-acid-synthase hybrid can utilize fluoromalonyl coenzyme A and fluoromethylmalonyl coenzyme A for polyketide chain extension, introducing fluorine or fluoro-methyl units in polyketide scaffolds. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of fluorinated 12- and 14-membered macrolactones and fluorinated derivatives of the macrolide antibiotics YC-17 and methymycin. The introduction of fluorine into a drug molecule can alter the biological responses to it, including modulating bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and selectivity. Now, a hybrid polyketide/fatty acid synthase multienzyme has been designed to incorporate fluorinated precursors during polyketide biosynthesis in an approach that provides new chemoenzymatic access to fluorinated natural compounds.

Title: 
Why charging Li–air batteries with current low-voltage mediators is slow and singlet oxygen does not explain degradation

Although Li–air rechargeable batteries offer higher energy densities than lithium-ion batteries, the insulating Li2O2 formed during discharge hinders rapid, efficient re-charging. Redox mediators are used to facilitate Li2O2 oxidation; however, fast kinetics at a low charging voltage are necessary for practical applications and are yet to be achieved. We investigate the mechanism of Li2O2 oxidation by redox mediators. The rate-limiting step is the outer-sphere one-electron oxidation of Li2O2 to LiO2, which follows Marcus theory. The second step is dominated by LiO2 disproportionation, forming mostly triplet-state O2. The yield of singlet-state O2 depends on the redox potential of the mediator in a way that does not correlate with electrolyte degradation, in contrast to earlier views. Our mechanistic understanding explains why current low-voltage mediators (&lt;+3.3 V) fail to deliver high rates (the maximum rate is at +3.74 V) and suggests important mediator design strategies to deliver sufficiently high rates for fast charging at potentials closer to the thermodynamic potential of Li2O2 oxidation (+2.96 V). Ultra-high-capacity Li–air batteries have low Coulombic efficiency and degrade during re-charging, resulting in a poor cycle life. Redox mediators enable improvements but only at undesirably high potentials. The origin of this high potential and the impact of purported reactive intermediates has now been elucidated by resolving the charging mechanism using Marcus theory.

Acceleration of a ground-state reaction by selective femtosecond-infrared-laser-pulse excitation

Infrared (IR) excitation of vibrations that participate in the reaction coordinate of an otherwise thermally driven chemical reaction are believed to lead to its acceleration. Attempts at the practical realization of this concept have been hampered so far by competing processes leading to sample heating. Here we demonstrate, using femtosecond IR-pump IR-probe experiments, the acceleration of urethane and polyurethane formation due to vibrational excitation of the reactants for 1:1 mixtures of phenylisocyanate and cyclohexanol, and toluene-2,4-diisocyanate and 2,2,2-trichloroethane-1,1-diol, respectively. We measured reaction rate changes upon selective vibrational excitation with negligible heating of the sample and observed an increase of the reaction rate up to 24%. The observation is rationalized using reactant and transition-state structures obtained from quantum chemical calculations. We subsequently used IR-driven reaction acceleration to write a polyurethane square on sample windows using a femtosecond IR pulse. A practical realization of selective IR-driven reaction-rate control has been hampered by competing processes leading to sample heating. Now, the acceleration of a bimolecular ground-state reaction in solution using the IR excitation of a vibration connected to the reaction coordinate is demonstrated. The behaviour is monitored and understood using a combination of femtosecond IR-pump IR-probe spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

Title: 
Hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium in water because its solvated structure inhibits correlated proton transfer

Proton transfer via hydronium and hydroxide ions in water is ubiquitous. It underlies acid–base chemistry, certain enzyme reactions, and even infection by the flu. Despite two centuries of investigation, the mechanism underlying why hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium in water is still not well understood. Herein, we employ state-of-the-art density-functional-theory-based molecular dynamics—with corrections for non-local van der Waals interactions, and self-interaction in the electronic ground state—to model water and hydrated water ions. At this level of theory, we show that structural diffusion of hydronium preserves the previously recognized concerted behaviour. However, by contrast, proton transfer via hydroxide is less temporally correlated, due to a stabilized hypercoordination solvation structure that discourages proton transfer. Specifically, the latter exhibits non-planar geometry, which agrees with neutron-scattering results. Asymmetry in the temporal correlation of proton transfer leads to hydroxide diffusing slower than hydronium. Even though the Grotthuss mechanism was proposed two centuries ago, it is still unclear why proton transfer via the hydroxide ion is slower than that via hydronium. Advanced ab initio molecular dynamics simulations now show that it is because proton transfer via hydroxide is less temporally correlated than transfer via hydronium.

Shape-preserving transformation of carbonate minerals into lead halide perovskite semiconductors based on ion exchange/insertion reactions

Biological and bio-inspired mineralization processes yield a variety of three-dimensional structures with relevance for fields such as photonics, electronics and photovoltaics. However, these processes are only compatible with specific material compositions, often carbonate salts, thereby hampering widespread applications. Here we present a strategy to convert a wide range of metal carbonate structures into lead halide perovskite semiconductors with tunable bandgaps, while preserving the 3D shape. First, we introduce lead ions by cation exchange. Second, we use carbonate as a leaving group, facilitating anion exchange with halide, which is followed rapidly by methylammonium insertion to form the perovskite. As proof of principle, pre-programmed carbonate salt shapes such as vases, coral-like forms and helices are transformed into perovskites while preserving the morphology and crystallinity of the initial micro-architectures. This approach also readily converts calcium carbonate biominerals into semiconductors, furnishing biological and programmable synthetic shapes with the performance of artificial compositions such as perovskite-based semiconductors. Biominerals feature unique and potentially useful three-dimensional structures but are often difficult to transform into functional materials. Now, a two-step ion exchange/insertion reaction has been shown to convert synthetic carbonate salts and calcium carbonate biominerals into lead halide perovskites with tunable optoelectronic properties while preserving the shapes and microstructures of the precursors.

Efficient platform for synthesizing comprehensive heparan sulfate oligosaccharide libraries for decoding glycosaminoglycan–protein interactions

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are abundant, ubiquitous carbohydrates in biology, yet their structural complexity has limited an understanding of their biological roles and structure–function relationships. Synthetic access to large collections of well defined, structurally diverse GAG oligosaccharides would provide critical insights into this important class of biomolecules and represent a major advance in glycoscience. Here we report a new platform for synthesizing large heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide libraries displaying comprehensive arrays of sulfation patterns. Library synthesis is made possible by improving the overall synthetic efficiency through universal building blocks derived from natural heparin and a traceless fluorous tagging method for rapid purification with minimal manual manipulation. Using this approach, we generated a complete library of 64 HS oligosaccharides displaying all possible 2-O-, 6-O- and N-sulfation sequences in the tetrasaccharide GlcN–IdoA–GlcN–IdoA. These diverse structures provide an unprecedented view into the sulfation code of GAGs and identify sequences for modulating the activities of important growth factors and chemokines. Large collections of defined glycosaminoglycan (GAG) structures have been synthetically challenging to obtain but are required to understand this important class of biomolecules. Now, an efficient platform for synthesizing large libraries of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides has been developed, providing a detailed view into the sulfation code of GAGs.

3D global aromaticity in a fully conjugated diradicaloid cage at different oxidation states

Aromaticity is a vital concept that governs the electronic properties of π-conjugated organic molecules and has long been restricted to 2D systems. The aromaticity in 3D π-conjugated molecules has been rarely studied. Here we report a fully conjugated diradicaloid molecular cage and its global aromaticity at different oxidation states. The neutral compound has an open-shell singlet ground state with a dominant 38π monocyclic conjugation pathway and follows the [4n + 2] Hückel aromaticity rule; the dication has a triplet ground state with a dominant 36π monocyclic conjugation pathway and satisfies [4n] Baird aromaticity; the tetracation is an open-shell singlet with 52 π-electrons that are delocalized along the 3D rigid framework, showing 3D global antiaromaticity; and the hexacation possesses D3 symmetry with 50 globally delocalized π-electrons, showing [6n + 2] 3D global aromaticity. Different types of aromaticity were therefore accessed in one molecular cage platform, depending on the symmetry, number of π-electrons and spin state. A conjugated diradicaloid cage has been synthesized and its aromaticity was investigated. The neutral compound and the dication have dominant monocyclic conjugation pathways and both are aromatic (the former following Hückel’s rule and the latter Baird’s rule). The tetracation ([6n + 4] π-electrons) exhibits global 3D antiaromaticity whereas the hexacation ([6n + 2] π-electrons) exhibits global 3D aromaticity and has high D3 symmetry.

A 68-codon genetic code to incorporate four distinct non-canonical amino acids enabled by automated orthogonal mRNA design

Orthogonal (O) ribosome-mediated translation of O-mRNAs enables the incorporation of up to three distinct non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in Escherichia coli (E. coli). However, the general and efficient incorporation of multiple distinct ncAAs by O-ribosomes requires scalable strategies for both creating efficiently and specifically translated O-mRNAs, and the compact expression of multiple O-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (O-aaRS)/O-tRNA pairs. We automate the discovery of O-mRNAs that lead to up to 40 times more protein, and are up to 50-fold more orthogonal, than previous O-mRNAs; protein yields from our O-mRNAs match or exceed those from wild-type mRNAs. These advances enable a 33-fold increase in yield for incorporating three distinct ncAAs. We automate the creation of operons for O-tRNA genes, and develop operons for O-aaRS genes. Combining our advances creates a 68-codon, 24-amino-acid genetic code to efficiently incorporate four distinct ncAAs into a single protein in response to four distinct quadruplet codons. Non-canonical amino acids can be incorporated into proteins through translation of orthogonal mRNAs. Now, automating the design of orthogonal mRNAs—which are more selectively and efficiently translated—in combination with compact orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA expression systems, enables the incorporation of four distinct non-canonical monomers via a 68-codon genetic code.

Meta-DNA structures

DNA origami has emerged as a highly programmable method to construct customized objects and functional devices in the 10–100 nm scale. Scaling up the size of the DNA origami would enable many potential applications, which include metamaterial construction and surface-based biophysical assays. Here we demonstrate that a six-helix bundle DNA origami nanostructure in the submicrometre scale (meta-DNA) could be used as a magnified analogue of single-stranded DNA, and that two meta-DNAs that contain complementary ‘meta-base pairs’ can form double helices with programmed handedness and helical pitches. By mimicking the molecular behaviours of DNA strands and their assembly strategies, we used meta-DNA building blocks to form diverse and complex structures on the micrometre scale. Using meta-DNA building blocks, we constructed a series of DNA architectures on a submicrometre-to-micrometre scale, which include meta-multi-arm junctions, three-dimensional (3D) polyhedrons, and various 2D/3D lattices. We also demonstrated a hierarchical strand-displacement reaction on meta-DNA to transfer the dynamic features of DNA into the meta-DNA. This meta-DNA self-assembly concept may transform the microscopic world of structural DNA nanotechnology. A six-helix bundle DNA structure called meta-DNA has now been assembled and shown to possess some structural properties similar to those of single-stranded DNA. Two meta-DNAs containing complementary ‘meta-base pairs’ are shown to form double helices. Meta-DNA building blocks are also used to construct a series of DNA architectures and to perform a hierarchical strand-displacement reaction.

Diels–Alder cycloadditions of strained azacyclic allenes

For over a century, the structures and reactivities of strained organic compounds have captivated the chemical community. Whereas triple-bond-containing strained intermediates have been well studied, cyclic allenes have received far less attention. Additionally, studies of cyclic allenes that bear heteroatoms in the ring are scarce. We report an experimental and computational study of azacyclic allenes, which features syntheses of stable allene precursors, the mild generation and Diels–Alder trapping of the desired cyclic allenes, and explanations of the observed regio- and diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, we show that stereochemical information can be transferred from an enantioenriched silyl triflate starting material to a Diels–Alder cycloadduct by way of a stereochemically defined azacyclic allene intermediate. These studies demonstrate that heteroatom-containing cyclic allenes, despite previously being overlooked as valuable synthetic intermediates, may be harnessed for the construction of complex molecular scaffolds bearing multiple stereogenic centres. Strained organic compounds have long fascinated the chemistry community. Heterocyclic allenes are particularly interesting strained intermediates, but their use in synthetic chemistry is rather scarce. Now, an experimental and computational study of azacyclic allenes demonstrates that heteroatom-containing cyclic allenes can be harnessed for the construction of complex molecular scaffolds, including those that bear multiple stereogenic centres.

Using waste poly(vinyl chloride) to synthesize chloroarenes by plasticizer-mediated electro(de)chlorination

New approaches are needed to both reduce and reuse plastic waste. In this context, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is an appealing target as it is the least recycled high-production-volume polymer due to its facile release of plasticizers and corrosive HCl gas. Herein, these limitations become advantageous in a paired-electrolysis reaction in which HCl is intentionally generated from PVC to chlorinate arenes in an air- and moisture-tolerant process that is mediated by the plasticizer. The reaction proceeds efficiently with other plastic waste present and a commercial plasticized PVC product (laboratory tubing) can be used directly. A simplified life-cycle assessment reveals that using PVC waste as the chlorine source in the paired-electrolysis reaction has a lower global warming potential than HCl. Overall, this method should inspire other strategies for repurposing waste PVC and related polymers using electrosynthetic reactions, including those that take advantage of existing polymer additives. The facile release of corrosive HCl gas and plasticizers from poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) makes it a challenging material to recycle. Now, it has been shown that PVC waste can be directly used as a halogen source to synthesize chloroarenes. This paired electro(de)chlorination is mediated by a phthalate plasticizer already contained in PVC waste.

I-motif DNA structures are formed in the nuclei of human cells

Human genome function is underpinned by the primary storage of genetic information in canonical B-form DNA, with a second layer of DNA structure providing regulatory control. I-motif structures are thought to form in cytosine-rich regions of the genome and to have regulatory functions; however, in vivo evidence for the existence of such structures has so far remained elusive. Here we report the generation and characterization of an antibody fragment (iMab) that recognizes i-motif structures with high selectivity and affinity, enabling the detection of i-motifs in the nuclei of human cells. We demonstrate that the in vivo formation of such structures is cell-cycle and pH dependent. Furthermore, we provide evidence that i-motif structures are formed in regulatory regions of the human genome, including promoters and telomeric regions. Our results support the notion that i-motif structures provide key regulatory roles in the genome. I-motif DNA structures are thought to form in cytosine-rich regions of the genome and to have regulatory functions; however, in vivo evidence for the existence of such structures has so far remained elusive. Now an engineered antibody that is selective for i-motif structures has been developed and used to detect i-motifs in the nuclei of human cells.

Title: 
Barcoded DNA origami structures for multiplexed optimization and enrichment of DNA-based protein-binding cavities

Simultaneous binding of molecules by multiple binding partners is known to strongly reduce the apparent dissociation constant of the corresponding molecular complexes, and can be used to achieve strong, non-covalent molecular interactions. Based on this principle, efficient binding of proteins to DNA nanostructures has been achieved previously by placing several aptamers in close proximity to each other onto DNA scaffolds. Here, we develop an approach for exploring design parameters, such as the geometric arrangement or the nanomechanical properties of the binding sites, that use two-dimensional DNA origami-based nanocavities that bear aptamers with known mechanical properties at defined distances and orientations. The origami structures are labelled with barcodes, which enables large numbers of binding cavities to be investigated in parallel and under identical conditions, and facilitates a direct and reliable quantitative comparison of their binding yields. We demonstrate that binding geometry and mechanical properties have a dramatic effect on origami-based multivalent binding sites, and that optimization of linker spacings and flexibilities can improve the effective binding strength of the sites substantially. Multivalent binding is a common strategy to enhance the interactions between weak binding partners. Now, following this principle, DNA origami scaffolds have been used to arrange DNA aptamers into specific geometries and to optimize linker spacings and flexibilities, which results in artificial binding sites with very high affinities for their corresponding ligands.

Title: 
Catalytic asymmetric C–C cross-couplings enabled by photoexcitation

Enantioselective catalytic processes are promoted by chiral catalysts that can execute a specific mode of catalytic reactivity, channeling the chemical reaction through a certain mechanistic pathway. Here, we show how by simply using visible light we can divert the established ionic reactivity of a chiral allyl–iridium(iii) complex to switch on completely new catalytic functions, enabling mechanistically unrelated radical-based enantioselective pathways. Photoexcitation provides the chiral organometallic intermediate with the ability to activate substrates via an electron-transfer manifold. This redox event unlocks an otherwise inaccessible cross-coupling mechanism, since the resulting iridium(ii) centre can intercept the generated radicals and undergo a reductive elimination to forge a stereogenic centre with high stereoselectivity. This photochemical strategy enables difficult-to-realize enantioselective alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling reactions between allylic alcohols and readily available radical precursors, which are not achievable under thermal activation. A chiral (η3-allyl)iridium(iii) complex has previously been used to catalyse enantioselective allylic substitution reactions in the polar domain. Now, it has been shown that the visible-light excitation of this iridium complex unlocks an otherwise inaccessible radical-based pathway to achieve enantioselective alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling reactions between allylic alcohols and radical precursors.

Title: 
Chemical profiling of DNA G-quadruplex-interacting proteins in live cells

DNA–protein interactions regulate critical biological processes. Identifying proteins that bind to specific, functional genomic loci is essential to understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms on a molecular level. Here we describe a co-binding-mediated protein profiling (CMPP) strategy to investigate the interactome of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) in native chromatin. CMPP involves cell-permeable, functionalized G4-ligand probes that bind endogenous G4s and subsequently crosslink to co-binding G4-interacting proteins in situ. We first showed the robustness of CMPP by proximity labelling of a G4 binding protein in vitro. Employing this approach in live cells, we then identified hundreds of putative G4-interacting proteins from various functional classes. Next, we confirmed a high G4-binding affinity and selectivity for several newly discovered G4 interactors in vitro, and we validated direct G4 interactions for a functionally important candidate in cellular chromatin using an independent approach. Our studies provide a chemical strategy to map protein interactions of specific nucleic acid features in living cells. DNA–protein interactions are essential to genome function, but they are challenging to map in a cellular environment. Now, a chemical proteomics approach, which uses DNA G-quadruplex-specific ligands containing a photocrosslinking motif, has enabled the systematic identification of DNA G-quadruplex-binding proteins in live cells.

Title: 
Intersystem crossing in the exit channel

Intersystem crossing plays an important role in photochemistry. It is understood to be efficient when heavy atoms are present due to strong spin–orbit coupling, or when strongly bound long-lived complexes are formed that increase the chance of finding the singlet–triplet intersection seam. Here we present evidence for a different intersystem crossing mechanism in the bimolecular reaction of O(3P) with alkylamines. In crossed-beam experiments, product velocity–flux maps are measured for aminoalkyl radicals produced from H abstraction from the methyl group, which also gives OH radicals as co-fragments. The low translational-energy release and isotropic angular distributions of the products indicate that such reactions undergo the formation of a complex before OH and aminoalkyl are produced. However, there is no well on the triplet potential energy surface that could support such a complex. Multi-reference ab initio calculations suggest, instead, that intersystem crossing occurs in the exit-channel region due to the long-range dipole–dipole interaction between the nascent radical product pair coupled with the vanishing singlet–triplet splitting at long range. Intersystem crossing then leads to a deep hydroxylamine well before OH elimination. Intersystem crossing (ISC) is a radiationless process that is important in many photophysical systems. It has now been observed to take place in the exit channel for the reaction of ground-state atomic oxygen with alkylamines.

Title: 
Structural basis for chain release from the enacyloxin polyketide synthase

Modular polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are molecular assembly lines that consist of several multienzyme subunits that undergo dynamic self-assembly to form a functional megacomplex. N- and C-terminal docking domains are usually responsible for mediating the interactions between subunits. Here we show that communication between two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase subunits responsible for chain release from the enacyloxin polyketide synthase, which assembles an antibiotic with promising activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, is mediated by an intrinsically disordered short linear motif and a β-hairpin docking domain. The structures, interactions and dynamics of these subunits were characterized using several complementary biophysical techniques to provide extensive insights into binding and catalysis. Bioinformatics analyses reveal that short linear motif/β-hairpin docking domain pairs mediate subunit interactions in numerous non-ribosomal peptide and hybrid polyketide–non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, including those responsible for assembling several important drugs. Short linear motifs and β-hairpin docking domains from heterologous systems are shown to interact productively, highlighting the potential of such interfaces as tools for biosynthetic engineering. The antibiotic enacyloxin IIa is assembled by a modular polyketide synthase, and released from it by condensation of the enacyloxin acyl chain with 3,4-dihydroxycyclohexane carboxylic acid. A multipronged approach shows the structural basis for recognition between the peptidyl carrier protein domain that bears the acyl chain and the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase condensation domain that ligates it with the carboxylic acid.

In situ chromatin interactomics using a chemical bait and trap approach

Elucidating the physiological binding partners of histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) is key to understanding fundamental epigenetic regulatory pathways. Determining such interactomes will enable the study of how perturbations of these interactions affect disease. Here we use a synthetic biology approach to set a series of hPTM-controlled photo-affinity traps in native chromatin. Using quantitative proteomics, the local interactomes of these chemically customized chromatin landscapes are determined. We show that the approach captures transiently interacting factors such as methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as previously reported and novel hPTM reader proteins. We also apply this in situ proteomics approach to a recently disclosed cancer-associated histone mutation, H3K4M, revealing a number of perturbed interactions with the mutated tail. Collectively our studies demonstrate that modifying and interrogating native chromatin with chemical precision is a powerful tool for exploring epigenetic regulation and dysregulation at the molecular level. Proteins that interact with histone post-translational modifications have now been identified using an approach based on split-intein mediated histone semisynthesis. Histone modifications and disease-relevant mutations were installed into native chromatin with an adjacent photocross-linker to enable in situ cross-linking. This strategy enabled the determination of chromatin-relevant interactomes and represents a powerful tool for exploring epigenetic regulation and dysregulation at the molecular level.

Synthesis of monophosphines directly from white phosphorus

Monophosphorus compounds are of enormous industrial importance due to the crucial roles they play in applications such as pharmaceuticals, photoinitiators and ligands for catalysis, among many others. White phosphorus (P4) is the key starting material for the preparation of all such chemicals. However, current production depends on indirect and inefficient, multi-step procedures. Here, we report a simple, effective ‘one-pot’ synthesis of a wide range of organic and inorganic monophosphorus species directly from P4. Reduction of P4 using tri-n-butyltin hydride and subsequent treatment with various electrophiles affords compounds that are of key importance for the chemical industry, and it requires only mild conditions and inexpensive, easily handled reagents. Crucially, we also demonstrate facile and efficient recycling and ultimately catalytic use of the tributyltin reagent, thereby avoiding the formation of substantial Sn-containing waste. Accessible, industrially relevant products include the fumigant PH3, the reducing agent hypophosphorous acid and the flame-retardant precursor tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride. State-of-the-art industrial methods for transforming P4 into useful phosphorus compounds currently rely on indirect, multi-step strategies. It has now been shown that straightforward one-pot reactions can convert P4 directly into industrially relevant products while requiring only mild conditions and simple, inexpensive reagents—and can also functionalize P4 catalytically.

Title: 
Catalytic remote hydrohalogenation of internal alkenes

Primary alkyl halides have broad utility as fine chemicals in organic synthesis. The direct halogenation of alkenes is one of the most efficient approaches for the synthesis of these halides. Internal alkenes, in particular mixtures of isomers from refineries, constitute readily available and inexpensive feedstock and are the most attractive starting materials for this synthesis. However, the hydrohalogenation of alkenes generally affords branched alkyl halides; there are no catalytic methods to prepare linear alkyl halides directly from internal alkenes, let alone from a mixture of alkene isomers. Here we report the remote oxidative halogenation of alkenes under palladium catalysis via which both terminal and internal alkenes yield primary alkyl halides efficiently. Engineering pyridine-oxazoline ligands by introducing a hydroxyl group is essential for achieving excellent chemo- and regioselectivity. The catalytic system is also good for the mixture of alkene isomers generated from dehydrogenation of alkanes, providing a window to investigate the high-value utilization of inexpensive alkanes. The hydrohalogenation of alkenes generally forms branched alkyl halides. Now, a palladium-catalysed method has been developed for the remote hydrohalogenation of internal and terminal alkenes, enabling the efficient synthesis of linear alkyl halides. The method uses an engineered Pyox ligand with a hydroxy group, which is essential for accelerating the oxidative halogenation.

Title: 
Simplified immunosuppressive and neuroprotective agents based on gracilin A

The architecture and bioactivity of natural products frequently serve as embarkation points for the exploration of biologically relevant chemical space. Total synthesis followed by derivative synthesis has historically enabled a deeper understanding of structure–activity relationships. However, synthetic strategies towards a natural product are not always guided by hypotheses regarding the structural features required for bioactivity. Here, we report an approach to natural product total synthesis that we term ‘pharmacophore-directed retrosynthesis’. A hypothesized, pharmacophore of a natural product is selected as an early synthetic target and this dictates the retrosynthetic analysis. In an ideal application, sequential increases in the structural complexity of this minimal structure enable development of a structure–activity relationship profile throughout the course of the total synthesis effort. This approach enables the identification of simpler congeners retaining bioactivity at a much earlier stage of a synthetic effort, as demonstrated here for the spongiane diterpenoid, gracilin A, leading to simplified derivatives with potent neuroprotective and immunosuppressive activity. Pharmacophore-directed retrosynthesis targets a potential pharmacophore from early on in a natural product synthesis and incremental increases in the complexity of this minimal structure enable a SAR profile to develop over the course of the campaign. The method is applied to gracilin A, finding simplified derivatives displaying potent immunosuppressive effects or selective neuroprotective effects in cell-based assays.

Aromatic hexazine [N6]4− anion featured in the complex structure of the high-pressure potassium nitrogen compound K9N56

The recent high-pressure synthesis of pentazolates and the subsequent stabilization of the aromatic [N5]− anion at atmospheric pressure have had an immense impact on nitrogen chemistry. Other aromatic nitrogen species have also been actively sought, including the hexaazabenzene N6 ring. Although a variety of configurations and geometries have been proposed based on ab initio calculations, one that stands out as a likely candidate is the aromatic hexazine anion [N6]4−. Here we present the synthesis of this species, realized in the high-pressure potassium nitrogen compound K9N56 formed at high pressures (46 and 61 GPa) and high temperature (estimated to be above 2,000 K) by direct reaction between nitrogen and KN3 in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. The complex structure of K9N56—composed of 520 atoms per unit cell—was solved based on synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction and corroborated by density functional theory calculations. The observed hexazine anion [N6]4− is planar and proposed to be aromatic. Aromatic polynitrogen units can display both high stability and high energy content. A hexazine anion has now been identified in a complex compound, K9N56, which is formed at high pressures and temperatures under laser-heating in a diamond anvil cell. The [N6]4− ring is planar and proposed to be aromatic.

Unnatural biosynthesis by an engineered microorganism with heterologously expressed natural enzymes and an artificial metalloenzyme

Synthetic biology enables microbial hosts to produce complex molecules from organisms that are rare or difficult to cultivate, but the structures of these molecules are limited to those formed by reactions of natural enzymes. The integration of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) that catalyse unnatural reactions into metabolic networks could broaden the cache of molecules produced biosynthetically. Here we report an engineered microbial cell expressing a heterologous biosynthetic pathway, containing both natural enzymes and ArMs, that produces an unnatural product with high diastereoselectivity. We engineered Escherichia coli with a heterologous terpene biosynthetic pathway and an ArM containing an iridium–porphyrin complex that was transported into the cell with a heterologous transport system. We improved the diastereoselectivity and product titre of the unnatural product by evolving the ArM and selecting the appropriate gene induction and cultivation conditions. This work shows that synthetic biology and synthetic chemistry can produce, by combining natural and artificial enzymes in whole cells, molecules that were previously inaccessible to nature. Natural products are produced by living organisms practising nature’s chemical transformations. Now, an unnatural product has been generated by creating hybrid biosynthetic microorganisms. These microorganisms combine an unnatural chemical transformation—catalysis by an artificial metalloenzyme containing an iridium-based, unnatural cofactor—with a natural biosynthetic pathway within the same cell.

Spatiotemporal functional assembly of split protein pairs through a light-activated SpyLigation

Proteins provide essential functional regulation of many bioprocesses across all scales of life; however, new techniques to specifically modulate protein activity within living systems and in engineered biomaterials are needed to better interrogate fundamental cell signalling and guide advanced decisions of biological fate. Here we establish a generalizable strategy to rapidly and irreversibly activate protein function with full spatiotemporal control. Through the development of a genetically encoded and light-activated SpyLigation (LASL), bioactive proteins can be stably reassembled from non-functional split fragment pairs following brief exposure (typically minutes) to cytocompatible light. Employing readily accessible photolithographic processing techniques to specify when, where and how much photoligation occurs, we demonstrate precise protein activation of UnaG, NanoLuc and Cre recombinase using LASL in solution, biomaterials and living mammalian cells, as well as optical control over protein subcellular localization. Looking forward, we expect that these photoclick-based optogenetic approaches will find tremendous utility in probing and directing complex cellular fates in both time and three-dimensional space. Techniques to specifically modulate protein activity are needed to interrogate spatial effects in cellular processes. A genetically encoded method for site-specific protein–protein conjugation based on a photoclick chemical reaction has now been developed. This method permits rapid and irreversible reassembly of bioactive proteins from non-functional split fragment pairs with full spatiotemporal control in solution, biomaterials and living mammalian cells.

Non-complementary strand commutation as a fundamental alternative for information processing by DNA and gene regulation

The discovery of the DNA double helix has revolutionized our understanding of data processing in living systems, with the complementarity of the two DNA strands providing a reliable mechanism for the storage of hereditary information. Here I reveal the ‘strand commutation’ phenomenon—a fundamentally different mechanism of information storage and processing by DNA/RNA based on the reversible low-affinity interactions of essentially non-complementary nucleic acids. I demonstrate this mechanism by constructing a memory circuit, a 5-min square-root circuit for 4-bit inputs comprising only nine processing ssDNAs, simulating a 572-input AND gate (surpassing the bitness of current electronic computers), and elementary algebra systems with continuously changing variables. Most importantly, I show potential pathways of gene regulation with strands of maximum non-complementarity to the gene sequence that may be key to the reduction of off-target therapeutic effects. This Article uncovers the information-processing power of the low-affinity interactions that may underlie major processes in an organism—from short-term memory to cancer, ageing and evolution. The complementarity of the two strands in the DNA double helix provides a mechanism for the storage and processing of genetic information. Now, an alternative ‘strand commutation’ mechanism of data processing with DNA/RNA has been revealed based on the reversible low-affinity interactions of essentially non-complementary nucleic acids.

Free-atom-like d states in single-atom alloy catalysts

Alloying provides a means by which to tune a metal catalyst’s electronic structure and thus tailor its performance; however, mean-field behaviour in metals imposes limits. To access unprecedented catalytic behaviour, materials must exhibit emergent properties that are not simply interpolations of the constituent components’ properties. Here we show an emergent electronic structure in single-atom alloys, whereby weak wavefunction mixing between minority and majority elements results in a free-atom-like electronic structure on the minority element. This unusual electronic structure alters the minority element’s adsorption properties such that the bonding with adsorbates resembles the bonding in molecular metal complexes. We demonstrate this phenomenon with AgCu alloys, dilute in Cu, where the Cu d states are nearly unperturbed from their free-atom state. In situ electron spectroscopy demonstrates that this unusual electronic structure persists in reaction conditions and exhibits a 0.1 eV smaller activation barrier than bulk Cu in methanol reforming. Theory predicts that several other dilute alloys exhibit this phenomenon, which offers a design approach that may lead to alloys with unprecedented catalytic properties. In solid metals, electron orbitals form broad bands and their binding of adsorbates depends on the bandwidth. Now, it is shown that a weak solute–matrix interaction in dilute alloys results in extremely narrow electronic bands on the solute, similar to a free-atom electronic structure. This structure affords unique adsorption properties important for catalysis.

Predicting the stability of homotrimeric and heterotrimeric collagen helices

Robust methods for predicting thermal stabilities of collagen triple helices are critical for understanding natural structure and stability in the collagen family of proteins and also for designing synthetic peptides mimicking these essential proteins. In this work, we determine the relative stability imparted on the collagen triple helix by single amino acids and interactions between amino acid pairs. Using this analysis, we create a comprehensive algorithm, SCEPTTr, for predicting melting temperatures of synthetic triple helices. Critically, our algorithm is compatible with every natural amino acid, can evaluate both homotrimers and heterotrimers, and accounts for all possible helix compositions and registers, including non-canonically staggered helices. We test and optimize our algorithm against 431 published collagen triple helices to demonstrate the quality of our predictive system. Finally, we use this algorithm to successfully guide the design of an ABC heterotrimer possessing high assembly specificity. Collagen-like peptides can self-assemble into hundreds of closely related triple helices. Now, an algorithm has been developed that predicts the most stable helix and the extent to which it will assemble to the exclusion of the competing helices. This information can help improve the understanding of triple helix design and assembly.

Isolation and electronic structures of derivatized manganocene, ferrocene and cobaltocene anions

The discovery of ferrocene nearly 70 years ago marked the genesis of metallocene chemistry. Although the ferrocenium cation was discovered soon afterwards, a derivatized ferrocenium dication was only isolated in 2016 and the monoanion of ferrocene has only been observed in low-temperature electrochemical studies. Here we report the isolation of a derivatized ferrocene anion in the solid state as part of an isostructural family of 3d metallocenates, which consist of anionic complexes of a metal centre (manganese, iron or cobalt) sandwiched between two bulky Cpttt ligands (where Cpttt is {1,2,4-C5H2 tBu3}). These thermally and air-sensitive complexes decompose rapidly above −30 °C; however, we were able to characterize all metallocenates by a wide range of physical techniques and ab initio calculations. These data have allowed us to map the electronic structures of this metallocenate family, including an unexpected high-spin S = 3/2 ground state for the 19e− derivatized ferrocene anion. Unlike ferrocene and its cationic counterpart ferrocenium, the ferrocene monoanion is an unusual species that has been observed through low-temperature electrochemical studies. Now, a family of isostructural 3d metallocenates has been isolated that consists of a manganocene, a cobaltocene and a high-spin ferrocene anion stabilized by cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing bulky aliphatic groups.

Quantum nanomagnets in on-surface metal-free porphyrin chains

Unlike classic spins, quantum magnets are spin systems that interact via the exchange interaction and exhibit collective quantum behaviours, such as fractional excitations. Molecular magnetism often stems from d/f-transition metals, but their spin–orbit coupling and crystal field induce a significant magnetic anisotropy, breaking the rotation symmetry of quantum spins. Thus, it is of great importance to build quantum nanomagnets in metal-free systems. Here we have synthesized individual quantum nanomagnets based on metal-free multi-porphyrin systems. Covalent chains of two to five porphyrins were first prepared on Au(111) under ultrahigh vacuum, and hydrogen atoms were then removed from selected carbons using the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope. The conversion of specific porphyrin units to their radical or biradical state enabled the tuning of intra- and inter-porphyrin magnetic coupling. Characterization of the collective magnetic properties of the resulting chains showed that the constructed S = 1/2 antiferromagnets display a gapped excitation, whereas the S = 1 antiferromagnets exhibit distinct end states between even- and odd-numbered spin chains, consistent with Heisenberg model calculations. Quantum nanomagnets, which display collective quantum behaviours, serve as important components in modern quantum technologies, but their fabrication has remained challenging. Quantum nanomagnets have now been constructed spin by spin in metal-free porphyrin chains, using on-surface synthesis and hydrogen manipulation using a scanning tunnelling microscope, and their collective quantum behaviours have been clearly resolved.

Insights from an information thermodynamics analysis of a synthetic molecular motor

Information is physical, a realization that has transformed the physics of measurement and communication. However, the flow between information, energy and mechanics in chemical systems remains largely unexplored. Here we analyse a minimalist autonomous chemically driven molecular motor in terms of information thermodynamics, a framework that quantitatively relates information to other thermodynamic parameters. The treatment reveals how directional motion is generated by free energy transfer from chemical to mechanical (conformational and/or co-conformational) processes by ‘energy flow’ and ‘information flow’. It provides a thermodynamic level of understanding of molecular motors that is general, complements previous analyses based on kinetics and has practical implications for machine design. In line with kinetic analysis, we find that power strokes do not affect the directionality of chemically driven machines. However, we find that power strokes can modulate motor velocity, the efficiency of free energy transfer and the number of fuel molecules consumed per cycle. This may help explain the role of such (co-)conformational changes in biomachines and illustrates the interplay between energy and information in chemical systems. Information is physical, but the flow between information, energy and mechanics in chemical systems remains largely unexplored. Now, an autonomous molecular motor has been analysed with information thermodynamics, which relates information to other thermodynamic parameters. This treatment provides a general thermodynamic understanding of molecular motors, with practical implications for machine design.

Concurrent control over sequence and dispersity in multiblock copolymers

Controlling monomer sequence and dispersity in synthetic macromolecules is a major goal in polymer science as both parameters determine materials’ properties and functions. However, synthetic approaches that can simultaneously control both sequence and dispersity remain experimentally unattainable. Here we report a simple, one pot and rapid synthesis of sequence-controlled multiblocks with on-demand control over dispersity while maintaining a high livingness, and good agreement between theoretical and experimental molecular weights and quantitative yields. Key to our approach is the regulation in the activity of the chain transfer agent during a controlled radical polymerization that enables the preparation of multiblocks with gradually ascending (Ɖ = 1.16 → 1.60), descending (Ɖ = 1.66 → 1.22), alternating low and high dispersity values (Ɖ = 1.17 → 1.61 → 1.24 → 1.70 → 1.26) or any combination thereof. We further demonstrate the potential of our methodology through the synthesis of highly ordered pentablock, octablock and decablock copolymers, which yield multiblocks with concurrent control over both sequence and dispersity. Synthetic approaches that can simultaneously control both polymer sequence and dispersity are difficult to achieve. Now, a switchable RAFT agent that regulates chain transfer activity during controlled radical polymerization has been shown to enable the one-pot synthesis of sequence-controlled multiblocks with on-demand control over dispersity while maintaining high livingness.

Title: 
Relativistic quantum chemical calculations show that the uranium molecule U2 has a quadruple bond

Understanding the bonding, reactivity and electronic structure of actinides is lagging behind that of the rest of the periodic table. This can be partly explained by the challenges that one faces in experimental studies of such radioactive compounds and also by the need to properly account for relativistic effects in theoretical studies. A further challenge is the very complicated electronic structures encountered in actinide chemistry, as vividly illustrated by the naked diuranium molecule U2. Here we report a computational study of this emblematic molecule using state-of-the-art relativistic quantum chemical methods. Notably, the variational inclusion of spin–orbit interactions leads not only to a different electronic ground state, but also to a lower bond multiplicity compared with those in previous studies. Establishing a fundamental understanding of the electronic structure of actinides remains a challenging task for both experiment and theory. Now, it is shown that for the uranium dimer, relativity and electron correlation affects not only the nature of the electronic ground state, but also lowers the bond multiplicity in comparison to previous studies.

Modular and regioselective synthesis of all-carbon tetrasubstituted olefins enabled by an alkenyl Catellani reaction

All-carbon tetrasubstituted olefins have been found in numerous biologically important compounds and organic materials. However, regio- and stereocontrolled construction of this structural motif still constitutes a significant synthetic challenge. Here, we show that a modular and regioselective synthesis of all-carbon tetrasubstituted olefins can be realized via alkenyl halide- or triflate-mediated palladium/norbornene catalysis, which is enabled by a modified norbornene containing a C2 amide moiety. This new norbornene co-catalyst effectively suppressed undesired cyclopropanation pathways, which have previously been a main obstacle for developing such reactions. Diverse cyclic and acyclic alkenyl bromides or triflates with a wide range of functional groups can be employed as substrates. Various substituents can be introduced at the alkene C1 and C2 positions regioselectively simply by changing the coupling partners. Initial mechanistic studies provide insights on the rate-limiting step as well as the structure of the actual active ligand in this system. All-carbon tetrasubstituted olefins are challenging to prepare in a regio- and stereocontrolled fashion. Now, using an amide-substituted norbornene as a co-catalyst, alkenyl halide- or triflate-mediated palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) catalysis has been demonstrated, providing an efficient strategy for modular and regioselective construction of all-carbon tetrasubstituted olefins.

Ultrafast formation dynamics of D3+ from the light-driven bimolecular reaction of the D2–D2 dimer

The light-driven formation of trihydrogen cation has been attracting considerable attention because of its important role as an initiator of chemical reactions in interstellar clouds. To understand the formation dynamics, most previous studies focused on creating H3+ or D3+ from unimolecular reactions of various organic molecules. Here we observe and characterize the ultrafast formation dynamics of D3+ from a bimolecular reaction, using pump–probe experiments that employ ultrashort laser pulses to probe its formation from a D2–D2 dimer. Our molecular dynamics simulations provide an intuitive representation of the reaction dynamics, which agree well with the experimental observation. We also show that the emission direction of D3+ can be controlled using a tailored two-colour femtosecond laser field. The underlying control mechanism is in line with what is known from the light control of electron localization in the bond breaking of single molecules. H3+ and D3+ serve as initiators of many chemical reactions in interstellar clouds. Now the ultrafast formation dynamics of D3+ from a light-driven bimolecular reaction starting from D2–D2 dimers have been measured. It has also been shown that the emission direction of D3+ can be controlled by driving the reaction with a more complex two-colour laser pulse.

Exciton annihilation in molecular aggregates suppressed through quantum interference

Exciton–exciton annihilation (EEA), an important loss channel in optoelectronic devices and photosynthetic complexes, has conventionally been assumed to be an incoherent, diffusion-limited process. Here we challenge this assumption by experimentally demonstrating the ability to control EEA in molecular aggregates using the quantum phase relationships of excitons. We employed time-resolved photoluminescence microscopy to independently determine exciton diffusion constants and annihilation rates in two substituted perylene diimide aggregates featuring contrasting excitonic phase envelopes. Low-temperature EEA rates were found to differ by more than two orders of magnitude for the two compounds, despite comparable diffusion constants. Simulated rates based on a microscopic theory, in excellent agreement with experiments, rationalize this EEA behaviour based on quantum interference arising from the presence or absence of spatial phase oscillations of delocalized excitons. These results offer an approach for designing molecular materials using quantum interference where low annihilation can coexist with high exciton concentrations and mobilities. Exciton–exciton annihilation is conventionally assumed to be limited by diffusion. Now, using time-resolved photoluminescence microscopy to determine exciton diffusion constants and annihilation rates in two substituted perylene diimide aggregates, along with a microscopic model, it has been shown that annihilation can be suppressed through quantum interference of the spatial phase of delocalized excitons.

Title: 
Using sulfuramidimidoyl fluorides that undergo sulfur(vi) fluoride exchange for inverse drug discovery

Drug candidates that form covalent linkages with their target proteins have been underexplored compared with the conventional counterparts that modulate biological function by reversibly binding to proteins, in part due to concerns about off-target reactivity. However, toxicity linked to off-target reactivity can be minimized by using latent electrophiles that only become activated towards covalent bond formation on binding a specific protein. Here we study sulfuramidimidoyl fluorides, a class of weak electrophiles that undergo sulfur(vi) fluoride exchange chemistry. We show that equilibrium binding of a sulfuramidimidoyl fluoride to a protein can allow nucleophilic attack by a specific amino acid side chain, which leads to conjugate formation. We incubated small molecules, each bearing a sulfuramidimidoyl fluoride electrophile, with human cell lysate, and the protein conjugates formed were identified by affinity chromatography–mass spectrometry. This inverse drug discovery approach identified a compound that covalently binds to and irreversibly inhibits the activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, an important anticancer target in living cells. Latent functional groups—typically unreactive unless activated by protein binding—can provide additional selectivity to covalent drugs. Now, compounds containing the weakly electrophilic sulfuramidimidoyl fluoride group, capable of undergoing sulfur(vi) fluoride exchange, have been used to identify reactive proteins in human cell lysate. This approach has identified a compound that conjugates to and inhibits an important anticancer target.

Title: 
Heated gas bubbles enrich, crystallize, dry, phosphorylate and encapsulate prebiotic molecules

Non-equilibrium conditions must have been crucial for the assembly of the first informational polymers of early life, by supporting their formation and continuous enrichment in a long-lasting environment. Here, we explore how gas bubbles in water subjected to a thermal gradient, a likely scenario within crustal mafic rocks on the early Earth, drive a complex, continuous enrichment of prebiotic molecules. RNA precursors, monomers, active ribozymes, oligonucleotides and lipids are shown to (1) cycle between dry and wet states, enabling the central step of RNA phosphorylation, (2) accumulate at the gas–water interface to drastically increase ribozymatic activity, (3) condense into hydrogels, (4) form pure crystals and (5) encapsulate into protecting vesicle aggregates that subsequently undergo fission. These effects occur within less than 30 min. The findings unite, in one location, the physical conditions that were crucial for the chemical emergence of biopolymers. They suggest that heated microbubbles could have hosted the first cycles of molecular evolution. High concentrations of prebiotic molecules and dry–wet cycles are difficult to achieve in a submerged system. Now, it has been shown that temperature gradients across gas bubbles in submerged rock pores can provide these conditions. Molecules are continuously accumulated at the warm side of bubbles at the gas–water interface, which enables or enhances many prebiotically relevant processes.

Title: 
Photocaged 5′ cap analogues for optical control of mRNA translation in cells

The translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) is a fundamental process in gene expression, and control of translation is important to regulate protein synthesis in cells. The primary hallmark of eukaryotic mRNAs is their 5′ cap, whose molecular contacts to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E govern the initiation of translation. Here we report 5′ cap analogues with photo-cleavable groups (FlashCaps) that prohibit binding to eIF4E and resist cleavage by decapping enzymes. These compounds are compatible with the general and efficient production of mRNAs by in vitro transcription. In FlashCap-mRNAs, the single photocaging group abrogates translation in vitro and in mammalian cells without increasing immunogenicity. Irradiation restores the native cap, triggering efficient translation. FlashCaps overcome the problem of remaining sequence or structure changes in mRNA after irradiation that limited previous designs. Together, these results demonstrate that FlashCaps offer a route to regulate the expression of any given mRNA and to dose mRNA therapeutics with spatio-temporal control. Analogues of mRNA 5′ caps containing a photo-cleavable group have now been developed. These so-called FlashCaps can be used for routine in vitro transcription to make long mRNAs containing a cap. In cells, the capped mRNAs are translationally muted; however, upon irradiation by light, the photo-cleavable group is removed without leaving any remaining modification and mRNA is then translated into the corresponding protein.

Title: 
A photoswitchable polar crystal that exhibits superionic conduction

Ionic conductors serve as solid electrolytes for fuel cells and batteries, whereas polar crystals such as ferroelectrics and pyroelectrics—which are typically insulating materials—are used in electronic devices. Here we show a material that combines superionic conductivity with a polar crystal structure at room temperature. This three-dimensional anionic network is based on –Fe–N≡C–Mo– units, with Cs cations hosted in every other pore. In the resulting Cs1.1Fe0.95[Mo(CN)5(NO)]·4H2O material, the negative and positive charges of the framework and Cs+ ions, respectively, are non-symmetrically shifted in the c-axis direction of the unit cell, and spontaneous electric polarization is generated, in turn leading to second harmonic generation (SHG). Additionally, this material is a superionic conductor (with an ionic conductivity value of 4 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 318 K). Furthermore, the ionic conductivity significantly decreases under 532 nm light irradiation (from 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 to 6 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature) and, when irradiation stops, returns to its original value within ~1 h. A material based on a three-dimensional –Fe–N≡C–Mo– anionic framework that hosts a Cs+ cation in every other pore has been shown to exhibit superionic conductivity, despite its polar crystal structure. It also exhibits second harmonic generation (SHG)—usually observed in insulators—and its ionic conductivity was reversibly altered under light irradiation.

Microporous membranes comprising conjugated polymers with rigid backbones enable ultrafast organic-solvent nanofiltration

Conventional technology for the purification of organic solvents requires massive energy consumption, and to reduce such expending calls for efficient filtration membranes capable of high retention of large molecular solutes and high permeance for solvents. Herein, we report a surface-initiated polymerization strategy through C–C coupling reactions for preparing conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) membranes. The backbone of the membranes consists of all-rigid conjugated systems and shows high resistance to organic solvents. We show that 42-nm-thick CMP membranes supported on polyacrylonitrile substrates provide excellent retention of solutes and broad-spectrum nanofiltration in both non-polar hexane and polar methanol, the permeance for which reaches 32 and 22 l m−2 h−1 bar−1, respectively. Both experiments and simulations suggest that the performance of CMP membranes originates from substantially open and interconnected voids formed in the highly rigid networks. Membranes with high selectivity and high permeance that allows rapid passage of solvent molecules are desirable for efficient separation processes. Microporous conjugated-polymer membranes have now been fabricated through surface-initiated polymerization. These membranes are capable of ultrafast organic-solvent nanofiltration because of the high porosity and pore interconnectivity originating from the rigid skeleton.

Title: 
Dynamic protein assembly by programmable DNA strand displacement

Inspired by the remarkable ability of natural protein switches to sense and respond to a wide range of environmental queues, here we report a strategy to engineer synthetic protein switches by using DNA strand displacement to dynamically organize proteins with highly diverse and complex logic gate architectures. We show that DNA strand displacement can be used to dynamically control the spatial proximity and the corresponding fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two fluorescent proteins. Performing Boolean logic operations enabled the explicit control of protein proximity using multi-input, reversible and amplification architectures. We further demonstrate the power of this technology beyond sensing by achieving dynamic control of an enzyme cascade. Finally, we establish the utility of the approach as a synthetic computing platform that drives the dynamic reconstitution of a split enzyme for targeted prodrug activation based on the sensing of cancer-specific miRNAs. The construction of dynamic protein–DNA nano-assemblies suitable for modulating protein proximities and activities has now been demonstrated. This approach uses DNA strand displacement and can enable control of enzyme activity to be programmed using logic gates. As a demonstration, a split enzyme capable of activating a prodrug is triggered is by cancer-specific miRNAs.

An integrated native mass spectrometry and top-down proteomics method that connects sequence to structure and function of macromolecular complexes

Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a crucial technique for the analysis of protein complexes. Native MS has traditionally examined protein subunit arrangements, while proteomics MS has focused on sequence identification. These two techniques are usually performed separately without taking advantage of the synergies between them. Here we describe the development of an integrated native MS and top-down proteomics method using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) to analyse macromolecular protein complexes in a single experiment. We address previous concerns of employing FTICR MS to measure large macromolecular complexes by demonstrating the detection of complexes up to 1.8 MDa, and we demonstrate the efficacy of this technique for direct acquirement of sequence to higher-order structural information with several large complexes. We then summarize the unique functionalities of different activation/dissociation techniques. The platform expands the ability of MS to integrate proteomics and structural biology to provide insights into protein structure, function and regulation. An integrated native mass spectrometry and top-down proteomics method using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance has been developed for the characterization of macromolecular protein complexes. This approach directly yields primary to quaternary structural information in a single native top-down experiment.

Genome-based discovery and total synthesis of janustatins, potent cytotoxins from a plant-associated bacterium

Host-associated bacteria are increasingly being recognized as underexplored sources of bioactive natural products with unprecedented chemical scaffolds. A recently identified example is the plant-root-associated marine bacterium Gynuella sunshinyii of the chemically underexplored order Oceanospirillales. Its genome contains at least 22 biosynthetic gene clusters, suggesting a rich and mostly uncharacterized specialized metabolism. Here, in silico chemical prediction of a non-canonical polyketide synthase cluster has led to the discovery of janustatins, structurally unprecedented polyketide alkaloids with potent cytotoxicity that are produced in minute quantities. A combination of MS and two-dimensional NMR experiments, density functional theory calculations of 13C chemical shifts and semiquantitative interpretation of transverse rotating-frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy data were conducted to determine the relative configuration, which enabled the total synthesis of both enantiomers and assignment of the absolute configuration. Janustatins feature a previously unknown pyridodihydropyranone heterocycle and an unusual biological activity consisting of delayed, synchronized cell death at subnanomolar concentrations. In silico chemical prediction of a polyketide synthase gene cluster in the bacterium Gynuella sunshinyii has led to the discovery of a class of natural products called janustatins. The absolute configuration of the stereocentres in these compounds was determined by a combination of techniques including DFT calculations and 2D NMR experiments—and finally confirmed by total synthesis. Janustatins were found to cause delayed, synchronized cell death at subnanomolar concentrations.

Fast motion of molecular rotors in metal–organic framework struts at very low temperatures

The solid state is typically not well suited to sustaining fast molecular motion, but in recent years a variety of molecular machines, switches and rotors have been successfully engineered within porous crystals and on surfaces. Here we show a fast-rotating molecular rotor within the bicyclopentane–dicarboxylate struts of a zinc-based metal–organic framework—the carboxylate groups anchored to the metal clusters act as an axle while the bicyclic unit is free to rotate. The three-fold bipyramidal symmetry of the rotator conflicts with the four-fold symmetry of the struts within the cubic crystal cell of the zinc metal–organic framework. This frustrates the formation of stable conformations, allowing for the continuous, unidirectional, hyperfast rotation of the bicyclic units with an energy barrier of 6.2 cal mol−1 and a high frequency persistent for several turns even at very low temperatures (1010 Hz below 2 K). Using zirconium instead of zinc led to a different metal cluster–carboxylate coordination arrangement in the resulting metal–organic framework, and much slower rotation of the bicyclic units. Molecular rotors have been engineered within the bicyclopentane–dicarboxylate struts of a metal–organic framework—the bicyclic unit is the rotator and the carboxylate groups serve as the stator. In a zinc-based metal–organic framework, the crossed conformation of the strut–metal nodes enables fast rotation of the bicyclic moiety, but in the corresponding zirconium metal–organic framework a change in the conformation results in much slower rotation.

Mutually orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs

Genetically encoding distinct non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins synthesized in cells requires mutually orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pairs. The pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/PyltRNA pair from Methanosarcina mazei (Mm) has been engineered to incorporate diverse ncAAs and is commonly considered an ideal pair for genetic code expansion. However, finding new aaRS/tRNA pairs that share the advantages of the MmPylRS/MmPyltRNA pair and are orthogonal to both endogenous aaRS/tRNA pairs and the MmPylRS/MmPyltRNA pair has proved challenging. Here we demonstrate that several ΔNPylRS/PyltRNACUA pairs, in which PylRS lacks an N-terminal domain, are active, orthogonal and efficiently incorporate ncAAs in Escherichia coli. We create new PylRS/PyltRNA pairs that are mutually orthogonal to the MmPylRS/MmPyltRNA pair and show that transplanting mutations that reprogram the ncAA specificity of MmPylRS into the new PylRS reprograms its substrate specificity. Finally, we show that distinct PylRS/PyltRNA-derived pairs can function in the same cell, decode distinct codons and incorporate distinct ncAAs. Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase(PylRS)/PyltRNACUA pairs that lack the N-terminal domain but are active and orthogonal are discovered, and pairs that are mutually orthogonal to existing PylRS/PyltRNACUA pairs are developed. Mutually orthogonal PylRS/PyltRNA pairs are combined to genetically encode the incorporation of distinct ncAAs into proteins synthesized in E. coli.

Functionalizing aromatic compounds with optical cycling centres

Molecular design principles provide guidelines for augmenting a molecule with a smaller group of atoms to realize a desired property or function. We demonstrate that these concepts can be used to create an optical cycling centre, the Ca(I)–O unit, that can be attached to a number of aromatic ligands, enabling the scattering of many photons from the resulting molecules without changing the molecular vibrational state. Such capability plays a central role in quantum state preparation and measurement, as well as laser cooling and trapping, and is therefore a prerequisite for many quantum science and technology applications. We provide further molecular design principles that indicate the ability to optimize and expand this work to an even broader class of molecules. This represents a great step towards a quantum functional group, which may serve as a generic qubit moiety that can be attached to a wide range of molecular structures and surfaces. Laser cooling of molecules with more than six atoms is challenging, mainly due to vibrational loss to dark states. Now, taking a step towards the development of a ‘quantum functional group’, it has been shown that such vibrational loss in molecules like phenol can be greatly restricted by functionalizing with a Ca(I)–O unit, which may serve as a generic qubit moiety.

Isotherms of individual pores by gas adsorption crystallography

Accurate measurements and assessments of gas adsorption isotherms are important to characterize porous materials and develop their applications. Although these isotherms provide knowledge of the overall gas uptake within a material, they do not directly give critical information concerning the adsorption behaviour of adsorbates in each individual pore, especially in porous materials in which multiple types of pore are present. Here we show how gas adsorption isotherms can be accurately decomposed into multiple sub-isotherms that correspond to each type of pore within a material. Specifically, two metal–organic frameworks, PCN-224 and ZIF-412, which contain two and three different types of pore, respectively, were used to generate isotherms of individual pores by combining gas adsorption measurements with in situ X-ray diffraction. This isotherm decomposition approach gives access to information about the gas uptake capacity, surface area and accessible pore volume of each individual pore, as well as the impact of pore geometry on the uptake and distribution of different adsorbates within the pores. Gas sorption studies in porous materials typically reflect their overall gas uptake. Now, using a ‘gas adsorption crystallography’ method, the gas adsorption isotherms of two metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been quantitatively decomposed into sub-isotherms that reflect the pore-filling behaviour of various guests in the different types of pores present in the MOFs.

Merging chemoenzymatic and radical-based retrosynthetic logic for rapid and modular synthesis of oxidized meroterpenoids

Meroterpenoids are natural products of hybrid biosynthetic origins—derived from both terpenoid and polyketide pathways—with a wealth of biological activities. Given their therapeutic potential, a general strategy to access these natural products in a concise and divergent fashion is highly desirable. Here, we report a modular synthesis of a suite of oxidized meroterpenoids using a hybrid synthetic strategy that is designed to harness the power of both biocatalytic and radical-based retrosynthetic logic. This strategy enables direct introduction of key hydroxyl groups and rapid construction of key bonds and stereocentres, facilitating the development of a concise route (7–12 steps from commercial materials) to eight oxidized meroterpenoids from two common molecular scaffolds. This work lays the foundation for rapid access to a wide range of oxidized meroterpenoids through the use of similar hybrid strategy that combines two synthetic approaches. Meroterpenoids are mixed terpenoid–polyketide natural products that exhibit a range of biological activities. A hybrid synthetic strategy that combines biocatalytic and radical-based methods has now been developed and it enables eight different oxidized meroterpenoids to be made in just 7–12 steps from commercially available materials.

Synthesis and reactivity of precolibactin 886

The clb gene cluster encodes the biosynthesis of metabolites known as precolibactins and colibactins. The clb pathway is found in gut commensal Escherichia coli, and clb metabolites are thought to initiate colorectal cancer via DNA crosslinking. Here we report confirmation of the structural assignment of the complex clb product precolibactin 886 via a biomimetic synthetic pathway. We show that an α-ketoimine linear precursor undergoes spontaneous cyclization to precolibactin 886 on HPLC purification. Studies of this α-ketoimine and the related α-dicarbonyl revealed that these compounds are unexpectedly susceptible to nucleophilic cleavage under mildly basic conditions. This cleavage pathway forms other known clb metabolites or biosynthetic intermediates and explains the difficulties in isolating fully mature biosynthetic products. This cleavage also accounts for a recently identified colibactin–adenine adduct. The colibactin peptidase ClbP deacylates synthetic precolibactin 886 to form a non-genotoxic pyridone, which suggests precolibactin 886 lies off the path of the major biosynthetic route. Precolibactin 886 is a complex microbiome-derived metabolite implicated in colorectal cancer and produced by the clb gene cluster. A chemical synthesis and analysis of precolibactin 886 is reported which shows that its biosynthetic precursor degrades to other known clb metabolites. The data also provide insights into the structures and reactivity of advanced clb products.

Tracing the ‘ninth sulfur’ of the nitrogenase cofactor via a semi-synthetic approach

The M-cluster is the [(homocitrate)MoFe7S9C] active site of nitrogenase that is derived from an 8Fe core assembled viacoupling and rearrangement of two [Fe4S4] clusters concomitant with the insertion of an interstitial carbon and a ‘ninth sulfur’. Combining synthetic [Fe4S4] clusters with an assembly protein template, here we show that sulfite can give rise to the ninth sulfur that is incorporated in the catalytically important belt region of the cofactor after the radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent carbide insertion and the concurrent 8Fe-core rearrangement have already taken place. Based on the differential reactivity of the formed cluster species, we also propose a new [Fe8S8C] cluster intermediate, the L*-cluster, which is similar to the [Fe8S9C] L-cluster, but lacks the ninth sulfur from sulfite. This work provides a semi-synthetic tool for protein reconstitution that could be widely applicable for the functional analysis of other FeS systems. The M-cluster in the active site of nitrogenase is derived from an 8Fe core assembled via coupling and rearrangement of two [Fe4S4] clusters concomitant with the insertion of an interstitial carbon and a ninth sulfur. Now, by combining synthetic [Fe4S4] clusters and assembly with a protein template, it has been shown that sulfite gives rise to the ninth sulfur that is inserted into the nitrogenase cofactor after the radical SAM-dependent carbide insertion and cofactor core rearrangement.

SARS-CoV-2 simulations go exascale to predict dramatic spike opening and cryptic pockets across the proteome

SARS-CoV-2 has intricate mechanisms for initiating infection, immune evasion/suppression and replication that depend on the structure and dynamics of its constituent proteins. Many protein structures have been solved, but far less is known about their relevant conformational changes. To address this challenge, over a million citizen scientists banded together through the Folding@home distributed computing project to create the first exascale computer and simulate 0.1 seconds of the viral proteome. Our adaptive sampling simulations predict dramatic opening of the apo spike complex, far beyond that seen experimentally, explaining and predicting the existence of ‘cryptic’ epitopes. Different spike variants modulate the probabilities of open versus closed structures, balancing receptor binding and immune evasion. We also discover dramatic conformational changes across the proteome, which reveal over 50 ‘cryptic’ pockets that expand targeting options for the design of antivirals. All data and models are freely available online, providing a quantitative structural atlas. Simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that include over 0.1 s of aggregate data are reported. Spike opening was observed, revealing cryptic epitopes that differ between variants, explaining differential interactions with antibodies and receptors that determine pathogenicity. The cryptic pockets described provide new targets for antivirals and a wealth of mechanistic insight.

Mechanism of molybdate insertion into pterin-based molybdenum cofactors

The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is found in the active site of numerous important enzymes that are critical to biological processes. The bidentate ligand that chelates molybdenum in Moco is the pyranopterin dithiolene (molybdopterin, MPT). However, neither the mechanism of molybdate insertion into MPT nor the structure of Moco prior to its insertion into pyranopterin molybdenum enzymes is known. Here, we report this final maturation step, where adenylated MPT (MPT–AMP) and molybdate are the substrates. X-ray crystallography of the Arabidopsis thaliana Mo-insertase variant Cnx1E S269D D274S identified adenylated Moco (Moco–AMP) as an unexpected intermediate in this reaction sequence. X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the first coordination sphere geometry of Moco trapped in the Cnx1E active site. We have used this structural information to deduce a mechanism for molybdate insertion into MPT–AMP. Given their high degree of structural and sequence similarity, we suggest that this mechanism is employed by all eukaryotic Mo-insertases. The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is found in the active site of numerous enzymes, but the mechanism of molybdate insertion is not clear. Now, the mechanism of the final maturation step, in which adenylated molybdopterin and molybdate are the substrates, has been revealed. X-ray crystallography of an Mo-insertase identified adenylated Moco as an unexpected intermediate in this reaction sequence.

A glycan gate controls opening of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

SARS-CoV-2 infection is controlled by the opening of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), which transitions from a glycan-shielded ‘down’ to an exposed ‘up’ state to bind the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and infect cells. While snapshots of the ‘up’ and ‘down’ states have been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomagraphy, details of the RBD-opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here over 130 µs of weighted ensemble simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD-opening pathways. Together with ManifoldEM analysis of cryo-electron microscopy data and biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408 and D427 also participate. The atomic-level characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided herein represents a landmark study for ensemble pathway simulations and offers a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infection. The opening mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been studied by integrating computational and experimental data. Combining weighted ensemble molecular dynamics simulations, biolayer interferometry and ManifoldEM analysis of cryo-EM data revealed that the glycan at N343 plays a gating role in the opening mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Micrometre-scale single-crystalline borophene on a square-lattice Cu(100) surface

Borophene, a crystalline monolayer boron sheet, has been predicted to adopt a variety of structures—owing to its high polymorphism—that may possess physical properties that could serve in flexible electronics, energy storage and catalysis. Several borophene polymorphs have been synthesized on noble metal surfaces but for device fabrication larger single-crystal domains are typically needed with, ideally, weak borophene–substrate interactions. Here we report the synthesis of borophene on a square-lattice Cu(100) surface and show that incommensurate coordination reduces the borophene–substrate interactions and also leads to a borophene polymorph different from those previous reported. Micrometre-scale single-crystal domains formed as isolated faceted islands or merged together to achieve full monolayer coverage. The crystal structure of this phase has ten boron atoms and two hexagonal vacancies in its unit cell. First-principles calculations indicate that charge transfer, rather than covalent bonding, binds this two-dimensional boron to the Cu(100) surface. The electronic band structure of this material features multiple anisotropic tilted Dirac cones. Borophene, a two-dimensional boron sheet, can adopt a variety of polymorphic structures that are predicted to possess interesting and potentially useful electronic properties. Micrometre-scale single-crystal borophene domains have now been grown on a square-lattice Cu(100) surface. The resulting boron sheets feature a rectangular unit cell, intrinsic stripe modulations and an unusual electron band structure.

Rupturing aromaticity by periphery overcrowding

The balance between strain relief and aromatic stabilization dictates the form and function of non-planar π-aromatics. Overcrowded systems are known to undergo geometric deformations, but the energetically favourable π-electron delocalization of their aromatic ring(s) is typically preserved. In this study we incremented the strain energy of an aromatic system beyond its aromatic stabilization energy, causing it to rearrange and its aromaticity to be ruptured. We noted that increasing the steric bulk around the periphery of π-extended tropylium rings leads them to deviate from planarity to form contorted conformations in which aromatic stabilization and strain are close in energy. Under increasing strain, the aromatic π-electron delocalization of the system is broken, leading to the formation of a non-aromatic, bicyclic analogue referred to as ‘Dewar tropylium’. The aromatic and non-aromatic isomers have been found to exist in rapid equilibrium with one another. This investigation demarcates the extent of steric deformation tolerated by an aromatic carbocycle and thus provides direct experimental insights into the fundamental nature of aromaticity. Stabilization from aromatic electron delocalization is highly favourable so it is typically preserved in even grossly distorted molecules. Now, peripheral overcrowding of an aromatic tropylium has been shown to cause sufficient geometric strain to rupture aromaticity, forming a non-aromatic bicyclic system that is in rapid equilibrium with its aromatic counterpart.

α-Fluorination of carbonyls with nucleophilic fluorine

Given the unique properties of fluorine, and the ability of fluorination to change the properties of organic molecules, there is significant interest from medicinal chemists in innovative methodologies that enable the synthesis of new fluorinated motifs. State-of-the-art syntheses of α-fluorinated carbonyl compounds invariably rely on electrophilic fluorinating agents, which can be strongly oxidizing and difficult to handle. Here we show that reversing the polarity of the enolate partner to that of an enolonium enables nucleophilic fluorinating agents to be used for direct chemoselective α-C–H-fluorination of amides. Reduction of these products enables facile access to β-fluorinated amines and the value of this methodology is shown by the easy preparation of a number of fluorinated analogues of drugs and agrochemicals. A fluorinated analogue of citalopram, a marketed antidepressant drug, is presented as an example of the preserved biological activity after fluorination. Introducing fluorine into organic compounds enables their electronic properties to be tuned and can also significantly alter their function. Now, the α-fluorination of amides has been achieved using nucleophilic fluorinating agents using a polarity reversal strategy. This new method has been used to synthesize a fluorinated analogue of the blockbuster antidepressant drug, citalopram.

Global analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters reveals conserved and unique natural products in entomopathogenic nematode-symbiotic bacteria

Microorganisms contribute to the biology and physiology of eukaryotic hosts and affect other organisms through natural products. Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus (XP) living in mutualistic symbiosis with entomopathogenic nematodes generate natural products to mediate bacteria–nematode–insect interactions. However, a lack of systematic analysis of the XP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) has limited the understanding of how natural products affect interactions between the organisms. Here we combine pangenome and sequence similarity networks to analyse BGCs from 45 XP strains that cover all sequenced strains in our collection and represent almost all XP taxonomy. The identified 1,000 BGCs belong to 176 families. The most conserved families are denoted by 11 BGC classes. We homologously (over)express the ubiquitous and unique BGCs and identify compounds featuring unusual architectures. The bioactivity evaluation demonstrates that the prevalent compounds are eukaryotic proteasome inhibitors, virulence factors against insects, metallophores and insect immunosuppressants. These findings explain the functional basis of bacterial natural products in this tripartite relationship. Entomopathogenic nematodes carrying Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria prey on insect larvae in the soil. Now, a comprehensive analysis of the bacterial genome has revealed ubiquitous and unique families of biosynthetic gene clusters. Evaluation of the bioactivity of the natural products expressed by the most prevalent cluster families explains the functional basis of bacterial natural products involved in bacteria–nematode–insect interactions.

5-Formylcytosine organizes nucleosomes and forms Schiff base interactions with histones in mouse embryonic stem cells

Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin that help the packaging of genetic material while controlling access to the genetic information. The underlying DNA sequence, together with transcription-associated proteins and chromatin remodelling complexes, are important factors that influence the organization of nucleosomes. Here, we show that the naturally occurring DNA modification, 5-formylcytosine (5fC) is linked to tissue-specific nucleosome organization. Our study reveals that 5fC is associated with increased nucleosome occupancy in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that 5fC-associated nucleosomes at enhancers in the mammalian hindbrain and heart are linked to elevated gene expression. Our study also reveals the formation of a reversible-covalent Schiff base linkage between lysines of histone proteins and 5fC within nucleosomes in a cellular environment. We define their specific genomic loci in mouse embryonic stem cells and look into the biological consequences of these DNA–histone Schiff base sites. Collectively, our findings show that 5fC is a determinant of nucleosome organization and plays a role in establishing distinct regulatory regions that control transcription. A series of in vitro and in vivo studies has now shown that 5fC is linked to increased nucleosome occupancy and stability. Moreover, there is evidence that Schiff base formation between histones and 5fC impacts RNA polymerase II transcription activity in mouse embryonic stem cells.

Using enzymes to tame nitrogen-centred radicals for enantioselective hydroamination

The formation of C–N bonds—of great importance to the pharmaceutical industry—can be facilitated enzymatically using nucleophilic and nitrene transfer mechanisms. However, neither natural nor engineered enzymes are known to generate and control nitrogen-centred radicals, which serve as valuable species for C–N bond formation. Here we use flavin-dependent ‘ene’-reductases with an exogenous photoredox catalyst to selectively generate amidyl radicals within the protein active site. These enzymes are engineered through directed evolution to catalyse 5-exo, 6-endo, 7-endo, 8-endo, and intermolecular hydroamination reactions with high levels of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that radical initiation occurs via an enzyme-gated mechanism, where the protein thermodynamically activates the substrate for reduction by the photocatalyst. Molecular dynamics studies indicate that the enzymes bind substrates using non-canonical binding interactions, which may serve as a handle to further manipulate reactivity. This approach demonstrates the versatility of these enzymes for controlling the reactivity of high-energy radical intermediates and highlights the opportunity for synergistic catalyst strategies to unlock previously inaccessible enzymatic functions. Expanding the biocatalysis toolbox for C–N bond formation is of great value. Now, a biocatalytic amination strategy using a new-to-nature mechanism involving nitrogen-centred radicals has been developed. The transformations are enabled by synergistic photoenzymatic catalysis, providing intra- and intermolecular hydroamination products with high yields and levels of enantioselectivity.

Title: 
Quantum interference effects elucidate triplet-pair formation dynamics in intramolecular singlet-fission molecules

Quantum interference (QI)—the constructive or destructive interference of conduction pathways through molecular orbitals—plays a fundamental role in enhancing or suppressing charge and spin transport in organic molecular electronics. Graphical models were developed to predict constructive versus destructive interference in polyaromatic hydrocarbons and have successfully estimated the large conductivity differences observed in single-molecule transport measurements. A major challenge lies in extending these models to excitonic (photoexcited) processes, which typically involve distinct orbitals with different symmetries. Here we investigate how QI models can be applied as bridging moieties in intramolecular singlet-fission compounds to predict relative rates of triplet pair formation. In a series of bridged intramolecular singlet-fission dimers, we found that destructive QI always leads to a slower triplet pair formation across different bridge lengths and geometries. A combined experimental and theoretical approach reveals the critical considerations of bridge topology and frontier molecular orbital energies in applying QI conductance principles to predict rates of multiexciton generation. Principles of quantum interference can guide the design of chromophores that undergo singlet fission. Now, ‘pencil and paper’ graphical models can be used to understand and predict the dynamics of triplet pairs generated through singlet fission in bridged dimers.

Synthesis of planar chiral ferrocenes via enantioselective remote C–H activation

Planar chiral ferrocenes are widely studied structures in asymmetric catalysis, materials science and medicinal chemistry. Although synthetic methods for 1,2-disubstituted planar chiral ferrocenes are well known, methods for the direct construction of 1,3-disubstituted planar chiral ferrocenes remain elusive. Here we report a modular platform for the construction of planar chirality in 1,3-disubstituted ferrocenes/ruthenocenes via an enantioselective relay remote C–H activation strategy. This method demonstrates a mechanism for remote enantiocontrol via enantiodetermining initial C‒H activation at the C2 position, enabled by a chiral mono-N-protected natural amino-acid ligand, and subsequent relay to the remote C3 position by a bridgehead-substituted norbornene mediator. A wide variety of 1,3-disubstituted planar chiral metallocenes are prepared with high enantioselectivity (96‒99% e.e.). The reaction shows good functional-group tolerance and high step-economy, and aryl iodides/bromides are compatible as coupling partners. The resulting metallocenes can be readily derivatized to yield planar chiral ligands and catalysts for asymmetric catalysis as well as building blocks for other applications. Methods for the direct construction of 1,3-disubstituted planar chiral ferrocenes are elusive. Now, a modular platform enables the construction of planar chirality in 1,3-disubstituted ferrocenes/ruthenocenes via enantioselective relay remote C–H arylation. The strategy involves an initial enantiodetermining ortho-C‒H activation enabled by a Pd(II)/chiral amino-acid ligand, followed by relay to the remote meta-position by a bridgehead-substituted norbornene mediator.

Title: 
Isoreticular two-dimensional magnetic coordination polymers prepared through pre-synthetic ligand functionalization

Chemical functionalization is a powerful approach to tailor the physical and chemical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, increase their processability and stability, tune their functionalities and, even, create new 2D materials. This is typically achieved through post-synthetic functionalization by anchoring molecules on the surface of an exfoliated 2D crystal, but it inevitably alters the long-range structural order of the material. Here we present a pre-synthetic approach that allows the isolation of crystalline, robust and magnetic functionalized monolayers of coordination polymers. A series of five isostructural layered magnetic coordination polymers based on Fe(ii) centres and different benzimidazole derivatives (bearing a Cl, H, CH3, Br or NH2 side group) were first prepared. On mechanical exfoliation, 2D materials are obtained that retain their long-range structural order and exhibit good mechanical and magnetic properties. This combination, together with the possibility to functionalize their surface at will, makes them good candidates to explore magnetism in the 2D limit and to fabricate mechanical resonators for selective gas sensing. Surface engineering is an attractive route to tune the processability, stability and functionalities of 2D materials, but typically introduces defects in the resulting structures. Now, the issue has been circumvented through pre-synthetic functionalization instead; an isoreticular family of robust layered coordination polymers has been mechanically exfoliated to give functionalized crystalline magnetic monolayers.

Title: 
Streamlining the chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex N-glycans by a stop and go strategy

Contemporary chemoenzymatic approaches can provide highly complex multi-antennary N-linked glycans. These procedures are, however, very demanding and typically involve as many as 100 chemical steps to prepare advanced intermediates that can be diversified by glycosyltransferases in a branch-selective manner to give asymmetrical structures commonly found in nature. Only highly specialized laboratories can perform such syntheses, which greatly hampers progress in glycoscience. Here we describe a biomimetic approach in which a readily available bi-antennary glycopeptide can be converted in ten or fewer chemical and enzymatic steps into multi-antennary N-glycans that at each arm can be uniquely extended by glycosyltransferases to give access to highly complex asymmetrically branched N-glycans. A key feature of our approach is the installation of additional branching points using recombinant MGAT4 and MGAT5 in combination with unnatural sugar donors. At an appropriate point in the enzymatic synthesis, the unnatural monosaccharides can be converted into their natural counterpart, allowing each arm to be elaborated into a unique appendage. Preparation of well-defined N-glycans is very demanding, which hampers progress in glycoscience. Now, a biomimetic synthetic approach has been developed in which a readily available bi-antennary glycan can be converted in ten or fewer steps into multi-antennary N-glycans. This approach enables each arm to be uniquely extended by glycosyltransferases to give complex branched N-glycans.

Title: 
Iron(ii) coordination complexes with panchromatic absorption and nanosecond charge-transfer excited state lifetimes

Replacing current benchmark rare-element photosensitizers with ones based on abundant and low-cost metals such as iron would help facilitate the large-scale implementation of solar energy conversion. To do so, the ability to extend the lifetimes of photogenerated excited states of iron complexes is critical. Here, we present a sensitizer design in which iron(ii) centres are supported by frameworks containing benzannulated phenanthridine and quinoline heterocycles paired with amido donors. These complexes exhibit panchromatic absorption and nanosecond charge-transfer excited state lifetimes, enabled by the combination of vacant, energetically accessible heterocycle-based acceptor orbitals and occupied molecular orbitals destabilized by strong mixing between amido nitrogen atoms and iron. This finding shows how ligand design can extend metal-to-ligand charge-transfer-type excited state lifetimes of iron(ii) complexes into the nanosecond regime and expand the range of potential applications for iron-based photosensitizers. Replacing rare elements in benchmark photosensitizers with iron would facilitate the large-scale implementation of solar energy conversion, but iron complexes generally do not exhibit sufficiently long-lived photoexcited states. Now, it has been shown that iron(ii) complexes with carefully designed ligands can absorb broadly across the visible light spectrum and have charge-transfer excited states with nanosecond lifetimes.

Title: 
FAD-dependent enzyme-catalysed intermolecular [4+2] cycloaddition in natural product biosynthesis

The Diels–Alder reaction is one of the most powerful and widely used methods in synthetic chemistry for the stereospecific construction of carbon–carbon bonds. Despite the importance of Diels–Alder reactions in the biosynthesis of numerous secondary metabolites, no naturally occurring stand-alone Diels–Alderase has been demonstrated to catalyse intermolecular Diels–Alder transformations. Here we report a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent enzyme, Morus alba Diels–Alderase (MaDA), from Morus cell cultures, that catalyses an intermolecular [4+2] cycloaddition to produce the natural isoprenylated flavonoid chalcomoracin with a high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory calculations and preliminary measurements of the kinetic isotope effects establish a concerted but asynchronous pericyclic pathway. Structure-guided mutagenesis and docking studies demonstrate the interactions of MaDA with the diene and dienophile to catalyse the [4+2] cycloaddition. MaDA exhibits a substrate promiscuity towards both dienes and dienophiles, which enables the expedient syntheses of structurally diverse natural products. We also report a biosynthetic intermediate probe (BIP)-based target identification strategy used to discover MaDA. A naturally occurring stand-alone and intermolecular Diels–Alderase, MaDA, has been identified from Morus alba cell cultures. MaDA is a FAD-dependent enzyme, which catalyses the intermolecular [4+2] cycloaddition via a concerted but asynchronous pericyclic pathway between morachalcone A and a diene generated from moracin C. Characterization revealed that MaDA possesses good substrate promiscuity towards both dienes and dienophiles.

The loss of endgroup effects in long pyridyl-endcapped oligoynes on the way to carbyne

The versatility of carbon is revealed in its all-carbon forms (allotropes), which feature unique properties (consider the differences between diamond, graphite, graphene and fullerenes). Beyond natural sources, there are many opportunities to expand the realm of carbon chemistry through the study of new carbon forms. In this work, the synthesis of oligo-/polyynes is used to model the elusive carbyne. The chemical stabilization of oligoynes by sterically encumbered endgroups, particularly the 3,5-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)pyridyl group, is key to assemble an extended series of stable oligoynes. The final member of this series is the longest monodisperse polyyne isolated and characterized so far, featuring 24 contiguous alkyne units (48 carbons). Spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis show that endgroups influence the properties of oligoyne derivatives, but this effect diminishes as length increases toward the polyyne/carbyne limit. For instance, with ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, molecular symmetry clearly documents the evolution of characteristics from oligoynes to polyynes (in which endgroup effects are absent). The combined experimental data are used to refine predictions for the D∞h structure of carbyne. Synthetic oligo-/polyynes with unprecedented length are used to model the elusive carbon allotrope carbyne. Spectroscopic and physical analyses show that endgroups influence the properties of shorter derivatives, but these effects predictably diminish in longer molecules. Molecular symmetry documents the evolution of characteristics from oligoynes to polyynes and offers predictions for the D∞h structure of carbyne.

Fragmentation and [4 + 3] cycloaddition in sodorifen biosynthesis

Terpenes constitute the largest class of natural products. Their skeletons are formed by terpene cyclases (TCs) from acyclic oligoprenyl diphosphates through sophisticated enzymatic conversions. These enzyme reactions start with substrate ionization through diphosphate abstraction, followed by a cascade reaction via cationic intermediates. Based on isotopic-labelling experiments in combination with a computational study, the cyclization mechanism for sodorifen, a highly methylated sesquiterpene from the soil bacterium Serratia plymuthica, was resolved. A peculiar problem in its biosynthesis lies in the formation of several methyl groups from chain methylene carbons. The underlying mechanism involves a methyltransferase-mediated cyclization and unprecedented ring contraction with carbon extrusion from the chain to form a methyl group. A terpene cyclase subsequently catalyses a fragmentation into two reactive intermediates, followed by hydrogen transfers between them and recombination of the fragments by [4 + 3] cycloaddition. This study solves the intricate mechanistic problem of extra methyl group formation in sodorifen biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of the methylated sesquiterpene sodorifen, which features a cryptic methylation pattern, has now been studied through extensive labelling experiments and computational chemistry. The methyl group formation is now understood to come from methylene carbons of the substrate farnesyl diphosphate and the absolute configuration of the biosynthetic intermediate presodorifen diphosphate has been revised.

Prebiotic photoredox synthesis from carbon dioxide and sulfite

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the major carbonaceous component of many planetary atmospheres, which includes the Earth throughout its history. Carbon fixation chemistry—which reduces CO2 to organics, utilizing hydrogen as the stoichiometric reductant—usually requires high pressures and temperatures, and the yields of products of potential use to nascent biology are low. Here we demonstrate an efficient ultraviolet photoredox chemistry between CO2 and sulfite that generates organics and sulfate. The chemistry is initiated by electron photodetachment from sulfite to give sulfite radicals and hydrated electrons, which reduce CO2 to its radical anion. A network of reactions that generates citrate, malate, succinate and tartrate by irradiation of glycolate in the presence of sulfite was also revealed. The simplicity of this carboxysulfitic chemistry and the widespread occurrence and abundance of its feedstocks suggest that it could have readily taken place on the surfaces of rocky planets. The availability of the carboxylate products on early Earth could have driven the development of central carbon metabolism before the advent of biological CO2 fixation. Carbon dioxide is a substantial component of many planetary atmospheres, but reduction of carbon dioxide requires conditions and substrates that are rare on planetary surfaces. Now, the reduction of carbon dioxide to organic species with biological relevance has been photochemically coupled to the oxidation of sulfite, suggesting that prebiotic carbon fixation could take place on the surfaces of rocky planets.

Selective discrimination and classification of G-quadruplex structures with a host–guest sensing array

The secondary structures of nucleic acids have an important influence on their cellular functions but can be difficult to identify and classify quickly. Here, we show that an arrayed suite of synthetic hosts and dyes is capable of fluorescence detection of oligonucleotide secondary structures. Multivariate analysis of different fluorescence enhancements—generated using cationic dyes that show affinity for both DNA G-quadruplexes and the synthetic hosts—enables discrimination between G-quadruplex structures of identical length and highly similar topological types. Different G-quadruplexes that display the same folding topology can also be easily differentiated by the number of G-quartets and sequence differences at the 3′ or 5′ ends. The array is capable of both differentiation and classification of the G-quadruplex structures at the same time. This simple non-invasive sensing method does not require the discovery and synthesis of specific G-quadruplex binding ligands, but employs a simple multicomponent approach to ensure wide applicability. DNA G-quadruplexes can adopt a variety of secondary structures, but it is challenging to identify and classify them quickly. Multivariate analysis of different fluorescence enhancements—generated from an arrayed suite of synthetic hosts and cationic dyes—enables discrimination between G-quadruplex structures of identical length and similar topological types.

Porous covalent organic nanotubes and their assembly in loops and toroids

Carbon nanotubes, and synthetic organic nanotubes more generally, have in recent decades been widely explored for application in electronic devices, energy storage, catalysis and biosensors. Despite noteworthy progress made in the synthesis of nanotubular architectures with well-defined lengths and diameters, purely covalently bonded organic nanotubes have remained somewhat challenging to prepare. Here we report the synthesis of covalently bonded porous organic nanotubes (CONTs) by Schiff base reaction between a tetratopic amine-functionalized triptycene and a linear dialdehyde. The spatial orientation of the functional groups promotes the growth of the framework in one dimension, and the strong covalent bonds between carbon, nitrogen and oxygen impart the resulting CONTs with high thermal and chemical stability. Upon ultrasonication, the CONTs form intertwined structures that go on to coil and form toroidal superstructures. Computational studies give some insight into the effect of the solvent in this assembly process. A wide variety of covalent organic cages and two- and three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks have been obtained through dynamic covalent chemistry, yet the synthesis of their one-dimensional counterparts has remained challenging. Porous covalent organic nanotubes have now been prepared through reversible aldehyde–amine condensation and it has been shown that these can further assemble into toroidal architectures.

Morphology tuning of inorganic nanomaterials grown by precipitation through control of electrolytic dissociation and supersaturation

The precise control of the morphology of inorganic materials during their synthesis is important yet challenging. Here we report that the morphology of a wide range of inorganic materials, grown by rapid precipitation from a metal cation solution, can be tuned during their crystallization from one- to three-dimensional (1D to 3D) structures without the need for capping agents or templates. This control is achieved by adjusting the balance between the electrolytic dissociation (α) of the reactants and the supersaturation (S) of the solutions. Low-α, weak electrolytes promoted the growth of anisotropic (1D and 2D) samples, with 1D materials favoured in particular at low S. In contrast, isotropic 3D polyhedral structures could only be prepared in the presence of strong electrolyte reactants (α ≈ 1) with low S. Using this strategy, a wide range of materials were prepared, including metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, molybdates, oxalates, phosphates, fluorides and iodate with a variety of morphologies. Precipitation enables the straightforward production of a variety of inorganic materials, but the rapid reaction rates involved typically make controlling their morphologies difficult. Now, the growth of either one-, two- or three-dimensional materials has been promoted by tuning of the reactants’ electrolytic dissociation and solution supersaturation, without the need for capping agents and templates.

Developing the 134Ce and 134La pair as companion positron emission tomography diagnostic isotopes for 225Ac and 227Th radiotherapeutics

Developing targeted α-therapies has the potential to transform how diseases are treated. In these interventions, targeting vectors are labelled with α-emitting radioisotopes that deliver destructive radiation discretely to diseased cells while simultaneously sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. Widespread implementation requires advances in non-invasive imaging technologies that rapidly assay therapeutics. Towards this end, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has emerged as one of the most informative diagnostic techniques. Unfortunately, many promising α-emitting isotopes such as 225Ac and 227Th are incompatible with PET imaging. Here we overcame this obstacle by developing large-scale (Ci-scale) production and purification methods for 134Ce. Subsequent radiolabelling and in vivo PET imaging experiments in a small animal model demonstrated that 134Ce (and its 134La daughter) could be used as a PET imaging candidate for 225AcIII (with reduced 134CeIII) or 227ThIV (with oxidized 134CeIV). Evaluating these data alongside X-ray absorption spectroscopy results demonstrated how success relied on rigorously controlling the CeIII/CeIV redox couple. 134Ce and 134La have great potential as companion diagnostic isotopes for radiotherapeutics labelled with α-emitting 225Ac and 227Th. Now, by controlling the CeIII/CeIV redox couple, the large-scale production, purification and characterization of 134Ce- and 134La-based radiolabels has been achieved and their use for in vivo positron emission tomography is demonstrated.

Continuous, autonomous subsurface cargo shuttling by nature-inspired meniscus-climbing systems

Water-walking insects can harness capillary forces by changing their body posture to climb or descend the meniscus between the surface of water and a solid object. Controlling surface tension in this manner is necessary for predation, escape and survival. Inspired by this behaviour, we demonstrate autonomous, aqueous-based synthetic systems that overcome the meniscus barrier and shuttle cargo subsurface to and from a landing site and a targeted drop-off site. We change the sign of the contact angle of a coacervate sac containing an aqueous phase or of a hydrogel droplet hanging from the surface by controlling the normal force acting on the sac or droplet. The cyclic buoyancy-induced cargo shuttling occurs continuously, as long as the supply of reactants diffusing to the sac or droplet from the surrounding aqueous phase is not exhausted. These findings may lead to potential applications in autonomously driven reaction or delivery systems and micro-/milli-robotics. Water-walking insects harness capillary forces by changing body posture to climb or descend the meniscus between water and a solid object. Now, autonomous aqueous-based synthetic systems have been shown to overcome the meniscus barrier and shuttle cargo subsurface between a landing site and targeted drop-off sites.

Direct observation of coherent femtosecond solvent reorganization coupled to intramolecular electron transfer

It is well known that the solvent plays a critical role in ultrafast electron-transfer reactions. However, solvent reorganization occurs on multiple length scales, and selectively measuring short-range solute–solvent interactions at the atomic level with femtosecond time resolution remains a challenge. Here we report femtosecond X-ray scattering and emission measurements following photoinduced charge-transfer excitation in a mixed-valence bimetallic (FeiiRuiii) complex in water, and their interpretation using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Combined experimental and computational analysis reveals that the charge-transfer excited state has a lifetime of 62 fs and that coherent translational motions of the first solvation shell are coupled to the back electron transfer. Our molecular dynamics simulations identify that the observed coherent translational motions arise from hydrogen bonding changes between the solute and nearby water molecules upon photoexcitation, and have an amplitude of tenths of ångströms, 120–200 cm−1 frequency and ~100 fs relaxation time. This study provides an atomistic view of coherent solvent reorganization mediating ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer. Solvent plays a critical role in electron-transfer reactions, but short-range solvation dynamics are challenging to observe. Now, femtosecond X-ray solution scattering has been used to directly monitor the reorganization of water upon ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer in a bimetallic complex. Coherent motions of the first-shell water molecules are observed, arising from changes in solute–solvent hydrogen bonding.

Atomic mechanism of metal crystal nucleus formation in a single-walled carbon nanotube

Knowing how crystals nucleate at the atomic scale is crucial for understanding, and in turn controlling, the structure and properties of a wide variety of materials. However, because of the scale and highly dynamic nature of nuclei, the formation and early growth of nuclei are very difficult to observe. Here, we have employed single-walled carbon nanotubes as test tubes, and an ‘atomic injector’ coupled with aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, to enable in situ imaging of the initial steps of nucleation at the atomic scale. With three different metals we observed three main processes prior to heterogeneous nucleation: formation of crystal nuclei directly from an atomic seed (Fe), from a pre-existing amorphous nanocluster (Au) or by coalescence of two separate amorphous sub-nanometre clusters (Re). We demonstrate the roles of the amorphous precursors and the existence of an energy barrier before nuclei formation. In all three cases, crystal nucleus formation occurred through a two-step nucleation mechanism. Crystal nucleation processes are difficult to probe experimentally because of the spatial and temporal scales involved. Now, the heterogeneous nucleation of three different metals has been observed by electron microscopy with atomic resolution—using single-walled carbon nanotube as test tubes—and, in each case, shown to adopt a two-step nucleation mechanism involving a metastable amorphous precursor.

Control over phase separation and nucleation using a laser-tweezing potential

Control over the nucleation of new phases is highly desirable but elusive. Even though there is a long history of crystallization engineering by varying physicochemical parameters, controlling which polymorph crystallizes or whether a molecule crystallizes or forms an amorphous precipitate is still&nbsp;a poorly understood practice. Although there are now numerous examples of control using laser-induced nucleation, the absence of physical understanding is preventing progress. Here we show that the proximity of a liquid–liquid critical point or the corresponding binodal line can be used by a laser-tweezing potential to induce concentration gradients. A simple theoretical model shows that the stored electromagnetic energy of the laser beam produces a free-energy potential that forces phase separation or triggers the nucleation of a new phase. Experiments in a liquid mixture using a low-power laser diode confirm the effect. Phase separation and nucleation using a laser-tweezing potential explains the physics behind non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation and suggests new ways of manipulating matter. A low-power laser can cause phase separation or trigger the nucleation of a new phase in the proximity of a liquid–liquid critical point, or binodal, using a laser tweezing potential. This effect explains the physics behind non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation and suggests new ways of manipulating matter.

Delayed fluorescence from a zirconium(iv) photosensitizer with ligand-to-metal charge-transfer excited states

Advances in chemical control of the photophysical properties of transition-metal complexes are revolutionizing a wide range of technologies, particularly photocatalysis and light-emitting diodes, but they rely heavily on molecules containing precious metals such as ruthenium and iridium. Although the application of earth-abundant ‘early’ transition metals in photosensitizers is clearly advantageous, a detailed understanding of excited states with ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) character is paramount to account for their distinct electron configurations. Here we report an air- and moisture-stable, visible light-absorbing Zr(iv) photosensitizer, Zr(MesPDPPh)2, where [MesPDPPh]2− is the doubly deprotonated form of [2,6-bis(5-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-3-phenyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyridine]. This molecule has an exceptionally long-lived triplet LMCT excited state (τ = 350 μs), featuring highly efficient photoluminescence emission (Ф = 0.45) due to thermally activated delayed fluorescence emanating from the higher-lying singlet configuration with significant LMCT contributions. Zr(MesPDPPh)2 engages in numerous photoredox catalytic processes and triplet energy transfer. Our investigation provides a blueprint for future photosensitizer development featuring early transition metals and excited states with significant LMCT contributions. Understanding the photophysical properties of transition-metal complexes is paramount to advances in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion and light-emitting diodes. Now, long-lived emission via thermally activated delayed fluorescence has been demonstrated from an air- and water-stable zirconium complex featuring excited states with significant ligand-to-metal charge transfer character.

Labelling and determination of the energy in reactive intermediates in solution enabled by energy-dependent reaction selectivity

Any long-lived chemical structure in solution is subject to statistical energy equilibration, so the history of any specific structure does not affect its subsequent reactions. This is not true for very short-lived intermediates because energy equilibration takes time. Here, this idea is applied to achieve the ‘energy labelling’ of a reactive intermediate. The selectivity of the ring-opening α-cleavage reaction of the 1-methylcyclobutoxy radical is found here to vary broadly depending on how the radical was formed. Reactions that provide little excess energy to the intermediate lead to a high selectivity in the subsequent cleavage (measured as a kinetic isotope effect), whereas reactions that provide more excess energy to the intermediate exhibit a lower selectivity. Accounting for the expected excess energy allows the prediction of the observed product ratios and, in turn, the product ratios can be used to determine the energy present in an intermediate. Short-lived intermediates in solution may react before undergoing thermal equilibration. This phenomenon is used here to achieve the ‘energy labelling’ of an alkoxy radical. The intermediate's excess energy varies broadly depending on how it is formed and can be determined from the observed reaction selectivity.

Site-selective photoinduced cleavage and profiling of DNA by chiral semiconductor nanoparticles

Gene editing is an important genetic engineering technique that enables gene manipulation at the molecular level. It mainly relies on engineered nucleases of biological origin, whose precise functions cannot be replicated in any currently known abiotic artificial material. Here, we show that chiral cysteine-modified CdTe nanoparticles can specifically recognize and, following photonic excitation, cut at the restriction site GAT′ATC (′ indicates the cut site) in double-stranded DNA exceeding 90 base pairs, mimicking a restriction endonuclease. Although photoinduced reactive oxygen species are found to be responsible for the cleavage activity, the sequence selectivity arises from the affinity between cysteine and the conformation of the specific DNA sequence, as confirmed by quantum-chemical calculations. In addition, we demonstrate non-enzymatic sequence-specific DNA incision in living cells and in vivo using these CdTe nanoparticles, which may help in the design of abiotic materials for gene editing and other biological applications. Genome editing relies on engineered nucleases to change an organism’s DNA, but has not yet been achieved using abiotic materials. Now, chiral cysteine-capped CdTe nanoparticles are found to specifically recognize and, following photoirradiation, cut between bases T and A at the GATATC restriction site in DNA with over 90 base pairs.

C–C bond activation enabled by dyotropic rearrangement of Pd(iv) species

The weak carbon–metal bond combined with the kinetic inertness of the carbon–carbon bond renders metal-catalysed C–C bond activation to be highly challenging. Most of the reported C–C bond activation methodologies involve strain-releasing cleavage of small rings to compensate for unfavourable kinetic and thermodynamic penalties associated with C–C bond cleavage. Here we report that the 1,2-positional interchange of vicinal C–C and C–Pd(iv) bonds (dyotropic rearrangement) can be realized in a stereospecific manner under mild conditions, giving access to quaternary carbon–palladium bonds. An enantioselective synthesis of medicinally relevant fluorinated cyclopentanes, featuring this rearrangement as a key step, has been developed. We anticipate that implementing a Pd-based dyotropic rearrangement in reaction design could provide a new tool in the development of Pd-catalysed transformations. Many C–C bond activation methods involve strain-releasing cleavage of small rings to compensate for unfavourable kinetics and thermodynamics. Now, the 1,2-positional interchange of vicinal C–C and C–Pd bonds has been reported, giving access to quaternary carbon–palladium bonds. This dyotropic rearrangement has been used for the enantioselective synthesis of functionalized fluorinated cyclopentanes.

Identification of targets of AMPylating Fic enzymes by co-substrate-mediated covalent capture

Various pathogenic bacteria use post-translational modifications to manipulate the central components of host cell functions. Many of the enzymes released by these bacteria belong to the large Fic family, which modify targets with nucleotide monophosphates. The lack of a generic method for identifying the cellular targets of Fic family enzymes hinders investigation of their role and the effect of the post-translational modification. Here, we establish an approach that uses reactive co-substrate-linked enzymes for proteome profiling. We combine synthetic thiol-reactive nucleotide derivatives with recombinantly produced Fic enzymes containing strategically placed cysteines in their active sites to yield reactive binary probes for covalent substrate capture. The binary complexes capture their targets from cell lysates and permit subsequent identification. Furthermore, we determined the structures of low-affinity ternary enzyme–nucleotide–substrate complexes by applying a covalent-linking strategy. This approach thus allows target identification of the Fic enzymes from both bacteria and eukarya. Many bacterial pathogens release effector enzymes belonging to the large Fic family, which modify host targets with nucleotide monophosphates. Now, recombinantly produced Fic enzymes have been equipped with synthetic thiol-reactive nucleotide derivatives to make covalent binary probes. The reaction of modified Fic enzymes with their targets permits covalent substrate capture and the structural determination of low-affinity ternary enzyme–nucleotide–substrate complexes.

Scalable and continuous access to pure cyclic polymers enabled by ‘quarantined’ heterogeneous catalysts

Cyclic polymers are topologically interesting and envisioned as a lubricant material. However, scalable synthesis of pure cyclic polymers remains elusive. The most straightforward way is to recover a used catalyst after the synthesis of cyclic polymers and reuse it. Unfortunately, this is demanding because of the catalyst’s vulnerability and inseparability from polymers, which reduce the practicality of the process. Here we develop a continuous circular process, where polymerization, polymer separation and catalyst recovery happen in situ, to dispense a pure cyclic polymer after bulk ring-expansion metathesis polymerization of cyclopentene. It is enabled by introducing silica-supported ruthenium catalysts and newly designed glassware. Different depolymerization kinetics of the cyclic polymer from its linear analogue are also discussed. This process minimizes manual labour, maximizes the security of vulnerable catalysts and guarantees the purity of cyclic polymers, thereby showcasing a prototype of a scalable access to cyclic polymers with increased turnovers (≥415,000) of precious catalysts. Cyclic polymers are topologically interesting and envisioned as a lubricant material, but methods for the scalable synthesis of pure cyclic polymers are currently elusive. Now, a scalable process has been developed by leveraging heterogeneity of the catalysts with the help of compartmentalized custom glassware, namely, a cyclic polymer dispenser.

A soil-inspired dynamically responsive chemical system for microbial modulation

Interactions between the microbiota and their colonized environments mediate critical pathways from biogeochemical cycles to homeostasis in human health. Here we report a soil-inspired chemical system that consists of nanostructured minerals, starch granules and liquid metals. Fabricated via a bottom-up synthesis, the soil-inspired chemical system can enable chemical redistribution and modulation of microbial communities. We characterize the composite, confirming its structural similarity to the soil, with three-dimensional X-ray fluorescence and ptychographic tomography and electron microscopy imaging. We also demonstrate that post-synthetic modifications formed by laser irradiation led to chemical heterogeneities from the atomic to the macroscopic level. The soil-inspired material possesses chemical, optical and mechanical responsiveness to yield write–erase functions in electrical performance. The composite can also enhance microbial culture/biofilm growth and biofuel production in vitro. Finally, we show that the soil-inspired system enriches gut bacteria diversity, rectifies tetracycline-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis and ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced rodent colitis symptoms within in vivo rodent models. Creating hierarchical synthetic materials that can modulate microbial communities remains a great challenge due to the complex interactions between microbiota and their colonized environments. Now, a soil-inspired chemical system that responds to chemical, optical and mechanical stimuli has been developed. The soil-inspired chemical system can enhance microbial cultures and biofuel production, enrich gut bacterial diversity and alleviate ulcerative colitis symptoms.

Fungal indole alkaloid biogenesis through evolution of a bifunctional reductase/Diels–Alderase

Prenylated indole alkaloids such as the calmodulin-inhibitory malbrancheamides and anthelmintic paraherquamides possess great structural diversity and pharmaceutical utility. Here, we report complete elucidation of the malbrancheamide biosynthetic pathway accomplished through complementary approaches. These include a biomimetic total synthesis to access the natural alkaloid and biosynthetic intermediates in racemic form and in vitro enzymatic reconstitution to provide access to the natural antipode (+)-malbrancheamide. Reductive cleavage of an l-Pro–l-Trp dipeptide from the MalG non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) followed by reverse prenylation and a cascade of post-NRPS reactions culminates in an intramolecular [4+2] hetero-Diels–Alder (IMDA) cyclization to furnish the bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane scaffold. Enzymatic assembly of optically pure (+)-premalbrancheamide involves an unexpected zwitterionic intermediate where MalC catalyses enantioselective cycloaddition as a bifunctional NADPH-dependent reductase/Diels–Alderase. The crystal structures of substrate and product complexes together with site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate how MalC and PhqE (its homologue from the paraherquamide pathway) catalyse diastereo- and enantioselective cyclization in the construction of this important class of secondary metabolites. The complete biosynthesis of the fungal indole alkaloid malbrancheamide, which culminates in an intramolecular [4+2] hetero-Diels–Alder cyclization to produce the bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane scaffold, has now been discovered. Chemical synthesis and protein structural analysis were used to provide mechanistic insight into this enzyme-dependent diastereo- and enantioselective cycloaddition.

A general design of caging-group-free photoactivatable fluorophores for live-cell nanoscopy

The controlled switching of fluorophores between non-fluorescent and fluorescent states is central to every super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (nanoscopy) technique, and the exploration of radically new switching mechanisms remains critical to boosting the performance of established, as well as emerging super-resolution methods. Photoactivatable dyes offer substantial improvements to many of these techniques, but often rely on photolabile protecting groups that limit their applications. Here we describe a general method to transform 3,6-diaminoxanthones into caging-group-free photoactivatable fluorophores. These photoactivatable xanthones (PaX) assemble rapidly and cleanly into highly fluorescent, photo- and chemically stable pyronine dyes upon irradiation with light. The strategy is extendable to carbon- and silicon-bridged xanthone analogues, yielding a family of photoactivatable labels spanning much of the visible spectrum. Our results demonstrate the versatility and utility of PaX dyes in fixed and live-cell labelling for conventional microscopy, as well as the coordinate-stochastic and deterministic nanoscopies STED, PALM and MINFLUX. The design of photoactivatable fluorophores—which are required for some super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods—usually relies on light-sensitive protecting groups imparting lipophilicity and generating reactive by-products. Now, it has been shown that by exploiting a unique intramolecular photocyclization, bright and highly photostable fluorophores can be rapidly generated in situ from appropriately substituted 1-alkenyl-3,6-diaminoxanthone precursors.

Simultaneous CO2 capture and metal purification from waste streams using triple-level dynamic combinatorial chemistry

A reduction in CO2 emissions is required to mitigate global warming. Post-combustion carbon capture is one of the most developed technologies that has the potential to meet this goal, but its cost prevents its widespread use. A different approach would be to use CO2 directly as it is captured, before it is stored. Here we explore spontaneous CO2 fixation by industrial polyamines as a strategy to generate dynamic libraries of ligands for metal separation and recovery. We identify the CO2 loadings and solvents promoting the optimal precipitation of each metal from the dynamic libraries of complexes. We demonstrate the separation of lanthanum and nickel using the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine vehicle, and show that the three metal constituents of the La2Ni9Co alloys used to manufacture the batteries of electric vehicles can be separated and recovered by successive CO2-induced selective precipitations. Beyond the concept of CO2-sourced multi-level dynamic coordination chemistry, this study provides a potential framework for integrated CO2 capture and use through sustainable processes. Carbon capture technologies are poised to play an important role in reducing CO2 emissions to mitigate global warming, but their cost prevents their extensive use. Now, CO2 capture and utilization have been combined using a triple-level dynamic combinatorial approach. CO2 was spontaneously captured by industrial polyamines to create libraries of ligands that can be used for the separation and recovery of metals.

Functional DNA-based cytoskeletons for synthetic cells

The cytoskeleton is an essential component of a cell. It controls the cell shape, establishes the internal organization, and performs vital biological functions. Building synthetic cytoskeletons that mimic key features of their natural counterparts delineates a crucial step towards synthetic cells assembled from the bottom up. To this end, DNA nanotechnology represents one of the most promising routes, given the inherent sequence specificity, addressability and programmability of DNA. Here we demonstrate functional DNA-based cytoskeletons operating in microfluidic cell-sized compartments. The synthetic cytoskeletons consist of DNA tiles self-assembled into filament networks. These filaments can be rationally designed and controlled to imitate features of natural cytoskeletons, including reversible assembly and ATP-triggered polymerization, and we also explore their potential for guided vesicle transport in cell-sized confinement. Also, they possess engineerable characteristics, including assembly and disassembly powered by DNA hybridization or aptamer–target interactions and autonomous transport of gold nanoparticles. This work underpins DNA nanotechnology as a key player in building synthetic cells. Cytoskeletons are essential components of cells that perform a variety of tasks, and artificial cytoskeletons that perform these functions are required for the bottom-up assembly of synthetic cells. Now, a multi-functional cytoskeleton mimic has been engineered from DNA, consisting of confined DNA filaments that are capable of reversible self-assembly and transport of gold nanoparticles and vesicular cargo.

Unravelling mechanistic features of organocatalysis with in situ modifications at the secondary sphere

Secondary-sphere interactions serve a fundamental role in controlling the reactivity and selectivity of organometallic and enzymatic catalysts. However, there is a dearth of studies that explicitly incorporate secondary-sphere modifiers into organocatalytic systems. In this work, we introduce an approach for the in situ systematic modification of organocatalysts in their secondary sphere through dynamic covalent binding under the reaction conditions. As a proof-of-concept, we applied boronic acids as secondary-sphere modifiers of N-heterocyclic carbenes that contained a hydroxy handle. The bound system formed in the reaction mixture catalysed the enantioselective benzoin condensations of a challenging substrate class that contains electron-withdrawing groups. Linear regression coupled with data visualization served to pinpoint the divergent origins of enantioselectivity for different substrates and decision tree algorithms served to formulate selection criteria for the appropriate secondary-sphere modifiers. The combination of this highly modular catalytic approach with machine-learning techniques provided mechanistic insights and guided the streamlined optimization process of a gram-scale reaction at low organocatalyst loading. Secondary-sphere interactions serve a fundamental role in controlling the reactivity and selectivity of organometallic and enzyme catalysts, but their study in organocatalytic systems is scarce. Now, it has been shown that the in situ secondary-sphere modification of organocatalysts combined with machine-learning techniques can uncover reaction mechanisms and streamline catalyst optimization.

Title: 
Understanding the quantum nature of low-energy C(3Pj) + He inelastic collisions

Inelastic collisions that occur between open-shell atoms and other atoms or molecules, and that promote a spin–orbit transition, involve multiple interaction potentials. They are non-adiabatic by nature and cannot be described within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation; in particular, their theoretical modelling becomes very challenging when the collision energies have values comparable to the spin–orbit splitting. Here we study inelastic collisions between carbon in its ground state C(3Pj=0) and helium atoms—at collision energies in the vicinity of spin–orbit excitation thresholds (~0.2 and 0.5 kJ mol−1)—that result in spin–orbit excitation to C(3Pj=1) and C(3Pj=2). State-to-state integral cross-sections are obtained from crossed-beam experiments with a beam source that provides an almost pure beam of&nbsp;C(3Pj=0) . We observe very good agreement between experimental and theoretical results (acquired using newly calculated potential energy curves), which validates our characterization of the quantum dynamical resonances that are observed. Rate coefficients at very low temperatures suitable for chemical modelling of the interstellar medium are also calculated. Collision-induced spin–orbit transitions involve multiple interaction potentials and are by nature non-adiabatic, complicating both their experimental and theoretical study. Crossed-beam experiments and non-Born–Oppenheimer quantum calculations for inelastic collisions of carbon atoms with helium atoms, down to energies corresponding to temperatures below 10 K, have now been performed. Quantum-dynamical resonances predicted by theory were experimentally detected.

Title: 
Emulsion-oriented assembly for Janus double-spherical mesoporous nanoparticles as biological logic gates

The ability of Janus nanoparticles to establish biological logic systems has been widely exploited, yet conventional non/uni-porous Janus nanoparticles are unable to fully mimic biological communications. Here we demonstrate an emulsion-oriented assembly approach for the fabrication of highly uniform Janus double-spherical MSN&amp;mPDA (MSN, mesoporous silica nanoparticle; mPDA, mesoporous polydopamine) nanoparticles. The delicate Janus nanoparticle possesses a spherical MSN with a diameter of ~150 nm and an mPDA hemisphere with a diameter of ~120 nm. In addition, the mesopore size in the MSN compartment is tunable from ~3 to ~25 nm, while those in the mPDA compartments range from ~5 to ~50 nm. Due to the different chemical properties and mesopore sizes in the two compartments, we achieve selective loading of guests in different compartments, and successfully establish single-particle-level biological logic gates. The dual-mesoporous structure enables consecutive valve-opening and matter-releasing reactions within one single nanoparticle, facilitating the design of single-particle-level logic systems. Large biomolecules cannot be loaded into conventional Janus nanoparticles with small mesopores, preventing the establishment of efficient logic-gate systems in single Janus nanoparticles. Now, an emulsion-oriented assembly approach has been shown to fabricate Janus double-spherical nanoparticles with dual-tunable mesopores, enabling the design of various single-particle-level logic systems.

Title: 
Fabrication of devices featuring covalently linked MoS2–graphene heterostructures

The most widespread method for the synthesis of 2D–2D heterostructures is the direct growth of one material on top of the other. Alternatively, flakes of different materials can be manually stacked on top of each other. Both methods typically involve stacking 2D layers through van der Waals forces—such that these materials are often referred to as van der Waals heterostructures—and are stacked one crystal or one device at a time. Here we describe the covalent grafting of 2H-MoS2 flakes onto graphene monolayers embedded in field-effect transistors. A bifunctional molecule featuring a maleimide and a diazonium functional group was used, known to connect to sulfide- and carbon-based materials, respectively. MoS2 flakes were exfoliated, functionalized by reaction with the maleimide moieties and then anchored to graphene by the diazonium groups. This approach enabled the simultaneous functionalization of several devices. The electronic properties of the resulting heterostructure are shown to be dominated by the MoS2–graphene interface. 2D–2D heterostructures are typically held together by van der Waals interactions. Now, an on-device MoS2–graphene heterostructure has been prepared that is covalently linked through a bifunctional molecule featuring a maleimide and a diazonium group. The electronic properties of the resulting heterostructure are shown to be dominated by the molecular interface.

Title: 
A new fundamental type of conformational isomerism

Isomerism is a fundamental chemical concept, reflecting the fact that the arrangement of atoms in a molecular entity has a profound influence on its chemical and physical properties. Here we describe a previously unclassified fundamental form of conformational isomerism through four resolved stereoisomers of a transoid (BF)O(BF)-quinoxalinoporphyrin. These comprise two pairs of enantiomers that manifest structural relationships not describable within existing IUPAC nomenclature and terminology. They undergo thermal diastereomeric interconversion over a barrier of 104 ± 2 kJ mol−1, which we term ‘akamptisomerization’. Feasible interconversion processes between conceivable synthesis products and reaction intermediates were mapped out by density functional theory calculations, identifying bond-angle inversion (BAI) at a singly bonded atom as the reaction mechanism. We also introduce the necessary BAI stereodescriptors parvo and amplo. Based on an extended polytope formalism of molecular structure and stereoisomerization, BAI-driven akamptisomerization is shown to be the final fundamental type of conformational isomerization. Isolable compounds displaying new fundamental forms of conformational isomerism were last discovered in 1914 (atropisomerism) and 1961 (hindered pyramidal inversion). Now, a new form—referred to as akamptisomerism—has been described through four resolved stereoisomers of a transoid (BF)O(BF)-quinoxalinoporphyrin compound. The stereodescriptors parvo and amplo, necessary for their classification, have also been introduced.

Site-selective tyrosine bioconjugation via photoredox catalysis for native-to-bioorthogonal protein transformation

The growing prevalence of synthetically modified proteins in pharmaceuticals and materials has exposed the need for efficient strategies to enable chemical modifications with high site-selectivity. While genetic engineering can incorporate non-natural amino acids into recombinant proteins, regioselective chemical modification of wild-type proteins remains a challenge. Herein, we use photoredox catalysis to develop a site-selective tyrosine bioconjugation pathway that incorporates bioorthogonal formyl groups, which subsequently allows for the synthesis of structurally defined fluorescent conjugates from native proteins. A water-soluble photocatalyst, lumiflavin, has been shown to induce oxidative coupling between a previously unreported phenoxazine dialdehyde tag and a single tyrosine site, even in the presence of multiple tyrosyl side chains, through the formation of a covalent C–N bond. A variety of native proteins, including those with multiple tyrosines, can successfully undergo both tyrosine-specific and single-site-selective labelling. This technology directly introduces aldehyde moieties onto native proteins, enabling rapid product diversification using an array of well-established bioorthogonal functionalization protocols including the alkyne–azide click reaction. Regioselective chemical modification of wild-type proteins remains challenging. Now, by harnessing the varied SOMOphilicity of native tyrosine residues through photoredox catalysis, a site-selective bioconjugation method has been developed. This technology directly incorporates bioorthogonal formyl groups in one step, forming structurally defined fluorescent conjugates that can be rapidly diversified to biorelevant products.

Title: 
A crystalline monosubstituted carbene

By flanking a carbene carbon with two substituents, it is possible to synthesize persistent triplet carbenes and isolable singlet carbenes. Isolable singlet carbenes are among the most powerful tools in chemistry, and they have even found medicinal and materials science applications. Between the rich chemistry of disubstituted carbenes and the transient parent carbene are the monosubstituted carbenes that, so far, have only been observed in matrices at very low temperatures of just a few K. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a crystalline monosubstituted carbene. The key for isolating such a species was to design the correct substituent, namely a benzo[c]pyrrolidino heterocycle, which can single-handedly tame the intrinsic tendency of carbenes towards dimerization. The π-donor ability of the nitrogen atom, coupled with the steric bulk of chemically inert substituents at the two adjacent quaternary carbons, make these scaffolds very attractive for the isolation of a variety of other hitherto elusive electron-deficient species. So far, monosubstituted carbenes have only been spectroscopically characterized at very low temperatures. Now, it has been shown that a bulky, chemically inert, amino substituent is enough to tame the intrinsic tendency of carbenes towards dimerization, enabling their isolation at room temperature.

A photosensitizer–polyoxometalate dyad that enables the decoupling of light and dark reactions for delayed on-demand solar hydrogen production

Decoupling the production of solar hydrogen from the diurnal cycle is a key challenge in solar energy conversion, the success of which could lead to sustainable energy schemes capable of delivering H2 independent of the time of day. Here, we report a fully integrated photochemical molecular dyad composed of a ruthenium-complex photosensitizer covalently linked to a Dawson polyoxometalate that acts as an electron-storage site and hydrogen-evolving catalyst. Visible-light irradiation of the system in solution leads to charge separation and electron storage on the polyoxometalate, effectively resulting in a liquid fuel. In contrast to related, earlier dyads, this system enables the harvesting, storage and delayed release of solar energy. On-demand hydrogen release is possible by adding a proton donor to the dyad solution. The system is a minimal molecular model for artificial photosynthesis and enables the spatial and temporal separation of light absorption, fuel storage and hydrogen release. Decoupling the processes of light harvesting and catalytic hydrogen evolution could be a potentially important step in storing solar energy. This has now been achieved with a single molecular unit: a light-harvesting ruthenium complex–polyoxometalate dyad that absorbs light, separates and stores charge and then generates hydrogen on demand following the addition of a proton donor.

Efficient and stereodivergent synthesis of unsaturated acyclic fragments bearing contiguous stereogenic elements

Synthetic organic strategies that enable the catalytic and rapid assembly of a large array of organic compounds that possess multiple stereocentres in acyclic systems are somewhat rare, especially when it comes to reaching today’s high standards of efficiency and selectivity. In particular, the catalytic preparation of a three-dimensional molecular layout of a simple acyclic hydrocarbon skeleton that possesses several stereocentres from simple and readily available reagents still represents a vastly uncharted domain. Here we report a rapid, modular, stereodivergent and diversity-oriented unified strategy to construct acyclic molecular frameworks that bear up to four contiguous and congested stereogenic elements, with remarkably high levels of stereocontrol and in only three catalytic steps from commercially available alkynes. A regio- and diastereoselective catalytic Heck migratory insertion reaction of alkenylcyclopropyl carbinols that merges selective C–C bond cleavage of a cyclopropane represents the key step. A rapid, modular, stereodivergent and diversity-oriented strategy for constructing acyclic molecular frameworks bearing up to four contiguous and congested stereogenic elements has been developed. This approach can yield the target compounds with remarkably high levels of stereocontrol in only three catalytic steps from commercially available alkynes.

Mass photometric detection and quantification of nanoscale α-synuclein phase separation

Protein liquid–liquid phase separation can lead to disease-related amyloid fibril formation. The mechanisms of conversion of monomeric protein into condensate droplets and of the latter into fibrils remain elusive. Here, using mass photometry, we demonstrate that the Parkinson’s disease-related protein, α-synuclein, can form dynamic nanoscale clusters at physiologically relevant, sub-saturated concentrations. Nanoclusters nucleate in bulk solution and promote amyloid fibril formation of the dilute-phase monomers upon ageing. Their formation is instantaneous, even under conditions where macroscopic assemblies appear only after several days. The slow growth of the nanoclusters can be attributed to a kinetic barrier, probably due to an interfacial penalty from the charged C terminus of α-synuclein. Our findings reveal that α-synuclein phase separation occurs at much wider ranges of solution conditions than reported so far. Importantly, we establish mass photometry as a promising methodology to detect and quantify nanoscale precursors of phase separation. We also demonstrate its general applicability by probing the existence of nanoclusters of a non-amyloidogenic protein, Ddx4n1. The mechanism of α-synuclein amyloid aggregation via liquid–liquid phase separation has so far remained elusive. Now, the existence of nanoscale clusters of α-synuclein in sub-saturated concentrations is observed using mass photometry. These nanoscale clusters can act as precursors to both macroscopic condensate droplets as well as amyloid fibrils.

Ion-mediated hydrogen-bond rearrangement through tunnelling in the iodide–dihydrate complex

A microscopic picture of hydrogen-bond structure and dynamics in ion hydration shells remains elusive. Small ion–dihydrate molecular complexes are ideal systems with which to investigate the interplay and competition between ion–water and water–water interactions. Here, state-of-the-art quantum dynamics simulations provide evidence for tunnelling in hydrogen-bond rearrangements in the iodide–dihydrate complex and show that it can be controlled through isotopic substitutions. We find that the iodide ion weakens the neighbouring water–water hydrogen bond, leading to faster water reorientation than in the analogous water trimer. These faster dynamics, which are apparently at odds with the slowdown observed in the first hydration shell of iodide in solution, can be traced back to the presence of a free OH bond in the iodide–dihydrate complex, which effectively triggers the overall structural rearrangements within it. Besides providing indirect support for cooperative hydrogen-bond dynamics in iodide solutions, the analysis presented here suggests that iodide ions may accelerate hydrogen-bond rearrangements at aqueous interfaces, where neighbouring water molecules can be undercoordinated. The structure and dynamics of hydrogen bonds in ion hydration shells are not yet fully understood, however, small ion–dihydrate molecular complexes represent ideal model systems with which to investigate the interplay between ion–water and water–water interactions. Now, state-of-the-art quantum dynamics simulations have provided evidence for tunnelling in hydrogen-bond rearrangements in the iodide–dihydrate complex.

Alkyl sulfinates as cross-coupling partners for programmable and stereospecific installation of C(sp3) bioisosteres

In recent years, a variety of cycloalkyl groups with quaternary carbons, in particular cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl trifluoromethyl groups, have emerged as promising bioisosteres in drug-like molecules. The modular installation of such bioisosteres remains challenging to synthetic chemists. Alkyl sulfinate reagents have been developed as radical precursors to prepare functionalized heterocycles with the desired alkyl bioisosteres. However, the innate (radical) reactivity of this transformation poses reactivity and regioselectivity challenges for the functionalization of any aromatic or heteroaromatic scaffold. Here we showcase the ability of alkyl sulfinates to engage in sulfurane-mediated C(sp3)–C(sp2) cross-coupling, thereby allowing for programmable and stereospecific installation of these alkyl bioisosteres. The ability of this method to simplify retrosynthetic analysis is exemplified by the improved synthesis of multiple medicinally relevant scaffolds. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations for the mechanism of this sulfur chemistry reveal a ligand-coupling trend under alkyl Grignard activation via the sulfurane intermediate, stabilized by solvation of tetrahydrofuran. Direct and stereospecific C(sp3)–C(sp2) cross-coupling reactions are highly desirable for the construction of complex molecular scaffolds. Now, using stable and easily accessible alkyl sulfinates as coupling reagents, a modular and programmable sulfurane-mediated coupling method has been developed for the installation of various hindered alkyl bioisosteres, such as trifluoromethyl cyclopropyl, to (hetero)aromatics.

Rapamycin-inspired macrocycles with new target specificity

Rapamycin and FK506 are macrocyclic natural products with an extraordinary mode of action, in which they form binary complexes with FK506-binding protein (FKBP) through a shared FKBP-binding domain before forming ternary complexes with their respective targets, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and calcineurin, respectively. Inspired by this, we sought to build a rapamycin-like macromolecule library to target new cellular proteins by replacing the effector domain of rapamycin with a combinatorial library of oligopeptides. We developed a robust macrocyclization method using ring-closing metathesis and synthesized a 45,000-compound library of hybrid macrocycles (named rapafucins) using optimized FKBP-binding domains. Screening of the rapafucin library in human cells led to the discovery of rapadocin, an inhibitor of nucleoside uptake. Rapadocin is a potent, isoform-specific and FKBP-dependent inhibitor of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 and is efficacious in an animal model of kidney ischaemia reperfusion injury. Together, these results demonstrate that rapafucins are a new class of chemical probes and drug leads that can expand the repertoire of protein targets well beyond mTOR and calcineurin. Rapamycin and FK506 are macrocycles that contain an FKBP-binding domain and an effector domain responsible for interacting with their respective targets, mTOR and calcineurin. Now, a 45,000-compound macrocycle library has been synthesized by fusing oligopeptides with synthetic FKBP-binding domains. Screening and subsequent optimization yielded a highly potent FKBP-dependent inhibitor of hENT1.

Title: 
Evolution of dynamical networks enhances catalysis in a designer enzyme

Activation heat capacity is emerging as a crucial factor in enzyme thermoadaptation, as shown by the non-Arrhenius behaviour of many natural enzymes. However, its physical origin and relationship to the evolution of catalytic activity remain uncertain. Here we show that directed evolution of a computationally designed Kemp eliminase reshapes protein dynamics, which gives rise to an activation heat capacity absent in the original design. These changes buttress transition-state stabilization. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations show that evolution results in the closure of solvent-exposed loops and a better packing of the active site. Remarkably, this gives rise to a correlated dynamical network that involves the transition state and large parts of the protein. This network tightens the transition-state ensemble, which induces a negative activation heat capacity and non-linearity in the activity–temperature dependence. Our results have implications for understanding enzyme evolution and suggest that selectively targeting the conformational dynamics of the transition-state ensemble by design and evolution will expedite the creation of novel enzymes. Computationally designed enzymes can be substantially improved by directed evolution. Now, it has been shown that evolution can introduce a dynamic network that selectively tightens the transition-state ensemble, giving rise to a negative activation heat capacity. Targeting such transition state conformational dynamics may expedite de novo enzyme creation.

A synergistic Rh(I)/organoboron-catalysed site-selective carbohydrate functionalization that involves multiple stereocontrol

Site-selective functionalization is a core synthetic strategy that has broad implications in organic synthesis. Particularly, exploiting chiral catalysis to control site selectivity in complex carbohydrate functionalizations has emerged as a leading method to unravel unprecedented routes into biologically relevant glycosides. However, robust catalytic systems available to overcome multiple facets of stereoselectivity challenges to this end still remain scarce. Here we report a synergistic chiral Rh(I)- and organoboron-catalysed protocol, which enables access into synthetically challenging but biologically relevant arylnaphthalene glycosides. Our method depicts the employment of chiral Rh(I) catalysis in site-selective carbohydrate functionalization and showcases the utility of boronic acid as a compatible co-catalyst. Crucial to the success of our method is the judicious choice of a suitable organoboron catalyst. We also determine that exquisite multiple aspects of stereocontrol, including enantio-, diastereo-, regio- and anomeric control and dynamic kinetic resolution, are concomitantly operative. Asymmetric systems for catalytic carbohydrate functionalization are mostly limited to chiral copper complexes and organocatalysts. Now, a synergistic chiral Rh(I)- and organoboron-catalysed site-selective functionalization of carbohydrate polyols has been developed, giving stereocontrolled access to biologically relevant arylhydronaphthalene glycosides. Enantio-, diastereo-, regio- and anomeric control and dynamic kinetic resolution were found to be concomitantly operative.

Evolution of sequence-defined highly functionalized nucleic acid polymers

The evolution of sequence-defined synthetic polymers made of building blocks beyond those compatible with polymerase enzymes or the ribosome has the potential to generate new classes of receptors, catalysts and materials. Here we describe a ligase-mediated DNA-templated polymerization and in vitro selection&nbsp;system to evolve highly functionalized nucleic acid polymers (HFNAPs) made from 32 building blocks that contain eight chemically diverse side chains on a DNA backbone. Through iterated cycles of polymer translation, selection and reverse translation, we discovered HFNAPs that bind proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and interleukin-6, two protein targets implicated in human diseases. Mutation and reselection of an active PCSK9-binding polymer yielded evolved polymers with high affinity (KD = 3 nM). This evolved polymer potently inhibited the binding between PCSK9 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Structure–activity relationship studies revealed that specific side chains at defined positions in the polymers are required for binding to their respective targets. Our findings expand the chemical space of evolvable polymers to include densely functionalized nucleic acids with diverse, researcher-defined chemical repertoires. A method to produce sequence-defined, diversely functionalized nucleic acid polymers that bind to proteins of biomedical interest has been developed. The method is based on a ligase-mediated, DNA-templated polymerization system and in vitro selection. The selected polymers are shown to bind their targets in a manner that is strongly dependent on specific side chains at certain polymer positions.

Molecular engineering of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites quantum wells

Semiconductor quantum-well structures and superlattices are key building blocks in modern optoelectronics, but it is difficult to simultaneously realize defect-free epitaxial growth while fine tuning the chemical composition, layer thickness and band structure of each layer to achieve the desired performance. Here we demonstrate the modulation of the electronic structure—and consequently the optical properties—of organic semiconducting building blocks that are incorporated between the layers of perovskites through a facile solution processing step. Self-aggregation of the conjugated organic molecules is suppressed by functionalization with sterically demanding groups and single crystalline organic–perovskite hybrid quantum wells (down to one-unit-cell thick) are obtained. The energy and charge transfers between adjacent organic and inorganic layers are shown to be fast and efficient, owing to the atomically flat interface and ultrasmall interlayer distance of the perovskite materials. The resulting two-dimensional hybrid perovskites are very stable due to protection given by the bulky hydrophobic organic groups. A solution-processing step has been used to prepare quantum-well structures that comprise a thin layer of perovskite sandwiched between two layers of conjugated oligothiophene derivatives. The band gap of the resulting 2D hybrid perovskites can be fine-tuned by functionalizing the organic component, which also improves the stability of the system.

The photochemical reaction of phenol becomes ultrafast at the air–water interface

Reactions at the interface between water and other phases play important roles in nature and in various chemical systems. Although some experimental and theoretical studies suggest that chemical reactions at water interfaces can be different from those in bulk water—for example, ‘on-water catalysis’ and the activation of photochemically inert fatty acids at the air–water interface upon photoexcitation—directly investigating these differences and generating molecular-level understanding has proved difficult. Here, we report on the direct probing of a photochemical reaction occurring at the air–water interface, using ultrafast phase-sensitive interface-selective nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy. The femtosecond time-resolved data obtained clearly show that the photoionization reaction of phenol proceeds 104 times faster at the water surface than in the bulk aqueous phase (upon irradiation with photons with the same energy). This finding demonstrates that photochemical reactions at water interfaces are very different from those in bulk water, reflecting distinct reaction environments at the interface. Reactions at the interface between water and other phases play important roles in various chemical settings. Now, ultrafast phase-sensitive interface-selective vibrational spectroscopy has revealed that the photoionization of phenol can occur four orders of magnitude faster at the water surface than in the bulk aqueous phase.

The gas-phase formation mechanism of iodic acid as an atmospheric aerosol source

Iodine is a reactive trace element in atmospheric chemistry that destroys ozone and nucleates particles. Iodine emissions have tripled since 1950 and are projected to keep increasing with rising O3 surface concentrations. Although iodic acid (HIO3) is widespread and forms particles more efficiently than sulfuric acid, its gas-phase formation mechanism remains unresolved. Here, in CLOUD atmospheric simulation chamber experiments that generate iodine radicals at atmospherically relevant rates, we show that iodooxy hypoiodite, IOIO, is efficiently converted into HIO3 via reactions (R1) IOIO + O3 → IOIO4 and (R2) IOIO4 + H2O → HIO3 + HOI + (1)O2. The laboratory-derived reaction rate coefficients are corroborated by theory and shown to explain field observations of daytime HIO3 in the remote lower free troposphere. The mechanism provides a missing link between iodine sources and particle formation. Because particulate iodate is readily reduced, recycling iodine back into the gas phase, our results suggest a catalytic role of iodine in aerosol formation. Iodic acid (HIO3) forms aerosols very efficiently, but its gas-phase formation mechanism is not well understood. Atmospheric simulation chamber experiments, quantum chemical calculations and kinetic modelling have now revealed that HIO3 forms as an early iodine oxidation product from hypoiodite. The mechanism explains field measurements and suggests a catalytic role for iodine in particle formation.

Design of a small molecule that stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor A enabled by screening RNA fold–small molecule interactions

Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) stimulates angiogenesis in human endothelial cells, and increasing its expression is a potential treatment for heart failure. Here, we report the design of a small molecule (TGP-377) that specifically and potently enhances VEGFA expression by the targeting of a non-coding microRNA that regulates its expression. A selection-based screen, named two-dimensional combinatorial screening, revealed preferences in small-molecule chemotypes that bind RNA and preferences in the RNA motifs that bind small molecules. The screening program increased the dataset of known RNA motif–small molecule binding partners by 20-fold. Analysis of this dataset against the RNA-mediated pathways that regulate VEGFA defined that the microRNA-377 precursor, which represses Vegfa messenger RNA translation, is druggable in a selective manner. We designed TGP-377 to potently and specifically upregulate VEGFA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These studies illustrate the power of two-dimensional combinatorial screening to define molecular recognition events between ‘undruggable’ biomolecules and small molecules, and the ability of sequence-based design to deliver efficacious structure-specific compounds. A selection-based screen has now revealed preferences in small-molecule chemotypes that bind RNA as well as preferences in the RNA motifs that bind small molecules. Analysis of these data enabled the design of a small molecule that selectively binds a non-coding microRNA and upregulates expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A.

Sorting sub-150-nm liposomes of distinct sizes by DNA-brick-assisted centrifugation

In cells, myriad membrane-interacting proteins generate and maintain curved membrane domains with radii of curvature around or below 50 nm. To understand how such highly curved membranes modulate specific protein functions, and vice versa, it is imperative to use small liposomes with precisely defined attributes as model membranes. Here, we report a versatile and scalable sorting technique that uses cholesterol-modified DNA ‘nanobricks’ to differentiate hetero-sized liposomes by their buoyant densities. This method separates milligrams of liposomes, regardless of their origins and chemical compositions, into six to eight homogeneous populations with mean diameters of 30–130 nm. We show that these uniform, leak-resistant liposomes serve as ideal substrates to study, with an unprecedented resolution, how membrane curvature influences peripheral (ATG3) and integral (SNARE) membrane protein activities. Compared with conventional methods, our sorting technique represents a streamlined process to achieve superior liposome size uniformity, which benefits research in membrane biology and the development of liposomal drug-delivery systems. Small liposomes of uniform sizes are valuable tools for studying membrane biology and developing drug-delivery vehicles. Now, a DNA-assisted sorting technique has been shown to produce multiple species of monodispersed liposomes with mean diameters below 150 nm in a scalable manner. This approach has enabled the high-resolution analyses of curvature-dependent membrane protein activities.

Light-controlled micron-scale molecular motion

The micron-scale movement of biomolecules along supramolecular pathways, mastered by nature, is a remarkable system requiring strong yet reversible interactions between components under the action of a suitable stimulus. Responsive microscopic systems using a variety of stimuli have demonstrated impressive relative molecular motion. However, locating the position of a movable object that travels along self-assembled fibres under an irresistible force has yet to be achieved. Here, we describe a purely supramolecular system where a molecular ‘traveller’ moves along a ‘path’ over several microns when irradiated with visible light. Real-time imaging of the motion in the solvated state using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy shows that anionic porphyrin molecules move along the fibres of a bis-imidazolium gel upon irradiation. Slight solvent changes mean movement and restructuring of the fibres giving microtoroids, indicating control of motion by fibre mechanics with solvent composition. The insight provided here may lead to the development of artificial travellers that can perform catalytic and other functions. In biological systems, controlled molecular motion along a particular path is realized by protein motors that travel along microtubule filaments. Now, control of motion with light has been achieved in a synthetic supramolecular system, in which anionic porphyrin molecules move along the fibres of a bis-imidazolium gel upon irradiation.

Spontaneous drying of non-polar deep-cavity cavitand pockets in aqueous solution

There are many open questions regarding the hydration of solvent-exposed non-polar tracts and pockets in proteins. Although water is predicted to de-wet purely repulsive surfaces and evacuate crevices, the extent of de-wetting is unclear when ubiquitous van der Waals interactions are in play. The structural simplicity of synthetic supramolecular hosts imbues them with considerable potential to address this issue. To this end, here we detail a combination of densimetry and molecular dynamics simulations of three cavitands, coupled with calorimetric studies of their complexes with short-chain carboxylates. Our results reveal the range of wettability possible within the ostensibly identical cavitand pockets—which differ only in the presence and/or position of the methyl groups that encircle the portal to their non-polar pockets. The results demonstrate the ability of macrocycles to template water cavitation within their binding sites and show how the orientation of methyl groups can trigger the drying of non-polar pockets in liquid water, which suggests new avenues to control guest complexation. Water plays an active role in modulating guest recognition by both artificial and biological hosts, but how this role can be controlled is unclear. Now, the de-wetting of the non-polar pockets of cavitands is shown to be affected by the orientation of methyl groups encircling the portal, which moderate the enthalpic and entropic contributions driving recognition.

Partitioning the interlayer space of covalent organic frameworks by embedding pseudorotaxanes in their backbones

Mono- or few-layer sheets of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represent an attractive platform of two-dimensional materials that hold promise for tailor-made functionality and pores, through judicious design of the COF building blocks. But although a wide variety of layered COFs have been synthesized, cleaving their interlayer stacking to obtain COF sheets of uniform thickness has remained challenging. Here, we have partitioned the interlayer space in COFs by incorporating pseudorotaxane units into their backbones. Macrocyclic hosts based on crown ethers were embedded into either a ditopic or a tetratopic acylhydrazide building block. Reaction with a tritopic aldehyde linker led to the formation of acylhydrazone-based layered COFs in which one basal plane is composed of either one layer, in the case of the ditopic macrocyclic component, or two adjacent layers covalently held together by its tetratopic counterpart. When a viologen threading unit is introduced, the formation of a host–guest complex facilitates the self-exfoliation of the COFs into crystalline monolayers or bilayers, respectively. Layered COFs are attractive precursors for two-dimensional materials but they are difficult to cleave into mono- or few-layer sheets. Pseudorotaxane moieties have now been embedded into layered COFs to facilitate their cleavage into sheets of uniform thickness. Crown-ether macrocycles within the COF backbone bind to ionic viologen guests, leading to electrostatic repulsion between layers.

Direct knock-on of desolvated ions governs strict ion selectivity in K+ channels

The seeming contradiction that K+ channels conduct K+ ions at maximal throughput rates while not permeating slightly smaller Na+ ions has perplexed scientists for decades. Although numerous models have addressed selective permeation in K+ channels, the combination of conduction efficiency and ion selectivity has not yet been linked through a unified functional model. Here, we investigate the mechanism of ion selectivity through atomistic simulations totalling more than 400 μs in length, which include over 7,000 permeation events. Together with free-energy calculations, our simulations show that both rapid permeation of K+ and ion selectivity are ultimately based on a single principle: the direct knock-on of completely desolvated ions in the channels’ selectivity filter. Herein, the strong interactions between multiple ‘naked’ ions in the four filter binding sites give rise to a natural exclusion of any competing ions. Our results are in excellent agreement with experimental selectivity data, measured ion interaction energies and recent two-dimensional infrared spectra of filter ion configurations. That K+ channels conduct K+ ions at near-diffusion limited rates, but block the passage of smaller Na+ ions, creates an apparent contradiction. Now, atomistic simulations and free-energy calculations are used to show that both K+ permeation and ion selectivity are governed by the direct knock-on of completely desolvated ions in the channels’ selectivity filter.

Modular enantioselective access to β-amino amides by Brønsted acid-catalysed multicomponent reactions

β-Amino acids are structural motifs widely found in therapeutic natural products, novel biomimetic polymers and peptidomimetics. As a convergent method, the synthesis of stereoenriched β-amino amides through the asymmetric Mannich reaction requires specialized amide substrates or a metal catalyst for enolate formation. By a redesign of the Ugi reaction, a conceptually different solution to prepare chiral β-amino amides was established using ambiphilic ynamides as two-carbon synthons. The modulation of ynamides or oxygen nucleophiles concisely furnished three classes of β-amino amides with generally good efficiency as well as excellent chemo- and stereo-control. The utility is verified in the preparation of over 100 desired products that bear one or two contiguous carbon stereocentres, including those that directly incorporate drug molecules. This advance also provides a synthetic shortcut to other valuable structures. The amino amides could be elaborated into β-amino acids, anti-vicinal diamines, γ-amino alcohols and β-lactams or undergo transamidation with amino acids and amine-containing pharmaceuticals. β-Amino acids are broadly found in biomimetic drugs and therapeutics, but the general synthesis of chiral β-amino amides remains limited. An organocatalytic four-component reaction has now been developed for their asymmetric synthesis with notable efficiency, chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity. This protocol shows broad product scope and provides a shortcut to other important structures.

Title: 
Ruthenium-catalysed oxidative conversion of ammonia into dinitrogen

Conversion of ammonia into dinitrogen has attracted broad scientific interest in relation to molecular models of the heterogeneous nitrogen fixation process, environmental treatment for denitrification and utilization of ammonia as an energy carrier. Here we show that some ruthenium complexes bearing 2,2′-bipyridyl-6,6′-dicarboxylate ligands work as catalysts for the ammonia oxidation reaction. Production of dinitrogen is observed when ammonium salts are treated with a triarylaminium radical as an oxidant and 2,4,6-collidine as a base in the presence of the ruthenium catalysts. Based on the characterization of some intermediates, we propose a reaction pathway via a bimetallic nitride–nitride coupling process. The proposed reaction pathway is supported by density functional theory calculations. Further investigation of the ammonia oxidation reaction under the electrochemical conditions revealed that the ruthenium complex works as a new anode catalyst for ammonia oxidation. The production of ammonia from dinitrogen is a well-studied process; however, the catalytic conversion of ammonia into dinitrogen is underdeveloped. Now, ammonia oxidation has been achieved using ruthenium complexes as catalysts. The production of dinitrogen is observed when ammonium salts are treated with a single-electron oxidant, base and ruthenium catalyst.

Imaging defects and their evolution in a metal–organic framework at sub-unit-cell resolution

Defect engineering of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offers promising opportunities for tailoring their properties to specific functions and applications. However, determining the structures of defects in MOFs—either point defects or extended ones—has proved challenging owing to the difficulty of directly probing local structures in these typically fragile crystals. Here we report the real-space observation, with sub-unit-cell resolution, of structural defects in the catalytic MOF UiO-66 using a combination of low-dose transmission electron microscopy and electron crystallography. Ordered ‘missing linker’ and ‘missing cluster’ defects were found to coexist. The missing-linker defects, reconstructed three-dimensionally with high precision, were attributed to terminating formate groups. The crystallization of the MOF was found to undergo an Ostwald ripening process, during which the defects also evolve: on prolonged crystallization, only the missing-linker defects remained. These observations were rationalized through density functional theory calculations. Finally, the missing-cluster defects were shown to be more catalytically active than their missing-linker counterparts for the isomerization of glucose to fructose. Structural defects are known to exist in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and to affect the materials’ properties, but their exact structures have remained difficult to determine. Now, missing-linker and missing-cluster defects have been observed in a MOF using low-dose transmission electron microscopy, enabling their distributions, evolutions during crystallization and effects on the material’s catalytic activity to be explored.

Title: 
A chiral interlocking auxiliary strategy for the synthesis of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes

Rotaxanes can display molecular chirality solely due to the mechanical bond between the axle and encircling macrocycle without the presence of covalent stereogenic units. However, the synthesis of such molecules remains challenging. We have discovered a combination of reaction partners that function as a chiral interlocking auxiliary to both orientate a macrocycle and, effectively, load it onto a new axle. Here we use these substrates to demonstrate the potential of a chiral interlocking auxiliary strategy for the synthesis of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes by producing a range of examples with high enantiopurity (93–99% e.e.), including so-called ‘impossible’ rotaxanes whose axles lack any functional groups that would allow their direct synthesis by other means. Intriguingly, by varying the order of bond-forming steps, we can effectively choose which end of an axle the macrocycle is loaded onto, enabling the synthesis of both hands of a single target using the same reactions and building blocks. The synthesis of chiral interlocked molecules in which the mechanical bond provides the only source of stereochemistry remains challenging. Now, a chiral interlocked auxiliary approach to mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes has been developed and its potential demonstrated through the synthesis of a range of difficult targets with high enantioselectivity.

Title: 
Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis enables the stereoselective one-step synthesis of complex frameworks

The rapid assembly of complex scaffolds in a single step from simple precursors identifies as an ideal reaction in terms of efficiency and sustainability. Indeed, the direct single-step synthesis of complex alkaloid frameworks remains an unresolved problem at the heart of organic chemistry in spite of the tremendous progress of the discipline. Herein, we present a broad strategy in which dynamically assembled ternary complexes are converted into valuable azabicyclic scaffolds based on the concept of inverse hydride shuttle catalysis. The ternary complexes are readily constructed in situ from three simple precursors and enable a highly modular installation of various substitution patterns. Upon subjection to a unique dual-catalytic system, the transient intermediates undergo an unusual hydride shuttle process that is initiated by a hydride donation event. Furthermore, we show that, in combination with asymmetric organocatalysis, the product alkaloid frameworks are obtained in excellent optical purity. The rapid assembly of complex scaffolds in a single step from simple precursors would be an ideal reaction in terms of efficiency and sustainability. Now, the single-step construction of alkaloid-like frameworks from three dynamically assembled precursors has been reported. Using a dual-catalytic system, the transformation involves a hydride shuttle process initiated by a hydride donation event.

Title: 
Cold quantum-controlled rotationally inelastic scattering of HD with H2 and D2 reveals collisional partner reorientation

Molecular interactions are best probed by scattering experiments. Interpretation of these studies has been limited by lack of control over the quantum states of the incoming collision partners. We report here the rotationally inelastic collisions of quantum-state prepared deuterium hydride (HD) with H2 and D2 using a method that provides an improved control over the input states. HD was coexpanded with its partner in a single supersonic beam, which reduced the collision temperature to 0–5 K, and thereby restricted the involved incoming partial waves to s and p. By preparing HD with its bond axis preferentially aligned parallel and perpendicular to the relative velocity of the colliding partners, we observed that the rotational relaxation of HD depends strongly on the initial bond-axis orientation. We developed a partial-wave analysis that conclusively demonstrates that the scattering mechanism involves the exchange of internal angular momentum between the colliding partners. The striking differences between H2/HD and D2/HD scattering suggest the presence of anisotropically sensitive resonances. Scattering of molecules at low temperature that are prepared in single quantum states illuminates the mechanism of rotationally inelastic collisions and reveals the reorientation of partner molecules. By correlating each outgoing partial wave with the incoming waves, partial-wave analysis of the scattering angular distribution determines the dominant short- and long-range anisotropies of the interaction potential.

Title: 
A modular XNAzyme cleaves long, structured RNAs under physiological conditions and enables allele-specific gene silencing

Nucleic-acid catalysts (ribozymes, DNA- and XNAzymes) cleave target (m)RNAs with high specificity but have shown limited efficacy in clinical applications. Here we report on the in vitro evolution and engineering of a highly specific modular RNA endonuclease XNAzyme, FR6_1, composed of 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-β-d-arabino nucleic acid (FANA). FR6_1 overcomes the activity limitations of previous DNA- and XNAzymes and can be retargeted to cleave highly structured full-length (&gt;5 kb) BRAF and KRAS mRNAs at physiological Mg2+ concentrations with allelic selectivity for tumour-associated (BRAF V600E and KRAS G12D) mutations. Phosphorothioate-FANA modification enhances FR6_1 biostability and enables rapid KRAS mRNA knockdown in cultured human adenocarcinoma cells with a G12D-allele-specific component provided by in vivo XNAzyme cleavage activity. These results provide a starting point for the development of improved gene-silencing agents based on FANA or other XNA chemistries. Oligonucleotide catalysts such as ribozymes and DNAzymes can cleave RNA efficiently and specifically but are typically dependent on high concentrations of divalent cations, limiting their biological applications. A modular XNAzyme catalyst composed of 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-β-d-arabino nucleic acid (FANA) has now been developed that can cleave long (&gt;5 kb), highly structured mRNAs under physiological conditions and enables allele-specific catalytic RNA knockdown inside cells.

Fibril formation and ordering of disordered FUS LC driven by hydrophobic interactions

Biomolecular condensates, protein-rich and dynamic membrane-less organelles, play critical roles in a range of subcellular processes, including membrane trafficking and transcriptional regulation. However, aberrant phase transitions of intrinsically disordered proteins in biomolecular condensates can lead to the formation of irreversible fibrils and aggregates that are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the implications, the interactions underlying such transitions remain obscure. Here we investigate the role of hydrophobic interactions by studying the low-complexity domain of the disordered ‘fused in sarcoma’ (FUS) protein at the air/water interface. Using surface-specific microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, we find that a hydrophobic interface drives fibril formation and molecular ordering of FUS, resulting in solid-like film formation. This phase transition occurs at 600-fold lower FUS concentration than required for the canonical FUS low-complexity liquid droplet formation in bulk. These observations highlight the importance of hydrophobic effects for protein phase separation and suggest that interfacial properties drive distinct protein phase-separated structures. Protein solutions can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation, by condensing into a dense phase that often resembles liquid droplets, which coexist with a dilute phase. Now it is shown that hydrophobic interactions, specifically at interfaces, can trigger a liquid–solid phase separation of a protein solution.

Structural snapshots of the minimal PKS system responsible for octaketide biosynthesis

Type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) are multi-enzyme complexes that produce secondary metabolites of medical relevance. Chemical backbones of such polyketides are produced by minimal PKS systems that consist of a malonyl transacylase, an acyl carrier protein and an α/β heterodimeric ketosynthase. Here, we present X-ray structures of all ternary complexes that constitute the minimal PKS system for anthraquinone biosynthesis in Photorhabdus luminescens. In addition, we characterize this invariable core using molecular simulations, mutagenesis experiments and functional assays. We show that malonylation of the acyl carrier protein is accompanied by major structural rearrangements in the transacylase. Principles of an ongoing chain elongation are derived from the ternary complex with a hexaketide covalently linking the heterodimeric ketosynthase with the acyl carrier protein. Our results for the minimal PKS system provide mechanistic understanding of PKSs and a fundamental basis for engineering PKS pathways for future applications. The invariable core of a type II polyketide synthase has been characterized using X-ray crystallography, simulations, mutagenesis experiments and functional assays. The characterization of the ternary acyl carrier protein complexes provides a mechanistic understanding of the reactivity and could inform future engineering of this complex biosynthetic machinery.

The cascade unzipping of ladderane reveals dynamic effects in mechanochemistry

Force can induce remarkable non-destructive transformations along a polymer, but we have a limited understanding of the energy transduction and product distribution in tandem mechanochemical reactions. Ladderanes consist of multiple fused cyclobutane rings and have recently been used as monomeric motifs to develop polymers that drastically change their properties in response to force. Here we show that [4]-ladderane always exhibits ‘all-or-none’ cascade mechanoactivations and the same stereochemical distribution of the generated dienes under various conditions and within different polymer backbones. Transition state theory fails to capture the reaction kinetics and explain the observed stereochemical distributions. Ab initio steered molecular dynamics reveals unique non-equilibrium dynamic effects: energy transduction from the first cycloreversion substantially accelerates the second cycloreversion, and bifurcation on the force-modified potential energy surface leads to the product distributions. Our findings illustrate the rich chemistry in closely coupled multi-mechanophores and an exciting potential for effective energy transduction in tandem mechanochemical reactions. The mechanochemical activation of [4]-ladderane/ene has been studied and found to exhibit cascade unzipping and a consistent stereochemical distribution of products under various conditions and in different polymer backbones. Ab initio steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed unique non-equilibrium dynamic effects in the mechanochemistry of ladderane, cascade activation and reaction pathway bifurcation.

General synthesis of single-atom catalysts with high metal loading using graphene quantum dots

Transition-metal single-atom catalysts present extraordinary activity per metal atomic site, but suffer from low metal-atom densities (typically less than 5 wt% or 1 at.%), which limits their overall catalytic performance. Here we report a general method for the synthesis of single-atom catalysts with high transition-metal-atom loadings of up to 40 wt% or 3.8 at.%, representing several-fold improvements compared to benchmarks in the literature. Graphene quantum dots, later interweaved into a carbon matrix, were used as a support, providing numerous anchoring sites and thus facilitating the generation of high densities of transition-metal atoms with sufficient spacing between the metal atoms to avoid aggregation. A significant increase in activity in electrochemical CO2 reduction (used as a representative reaction) was demonstrated on a Ni single-atom catalyst with increased Ni loading. Transition-metal single-atom catalysts display excellent activity per metal atom site, but suffer from low metal atom densities (typically less than 5 wt% or 1 at.%), which limits their overall catalytic performance. Now, the use of a graphene-quantum-dot primary support, later interweaved into a carbon matrix, has enabled the synthesis of single-atom catalysts with high transition-metal atom loadings of up to 40 wt% or 3.84 at.%.

Manganese-catalysed divergent silylation of alkenes

Transition-metal-catalysed, redox-neutral dehydrosilylation of alkenes is a long-standing challenge in organic synthesis, with current methods suffering from low selectivity and narrow scope. In this study, we report a general and simple method for the manganese-catalysed dehydrosilylation and hydrosilylation of alkenes, with Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst precursor, by using a ligand-tuned metalloradical reactivity strategy. This enables versatility and controllable selectivity with a 1:1 ratio of alkenes and silanes, and the synthetic robustness and practicality of this method are demonstrated using complex alkenes and light olefins. The selectivity of the reaction has been studied using density functional theory calculations, showing the use of an iPrPNP ligand to favour dehydrosilylation, while a JackiePhos ligand favours hydrosilylation. The reaction is redox-neutral and atom-economical, exhibits a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, and is suitable for various synthetic applications on a gram scale. Methods for the dehydrosilylation of alkenes typically suffer from low selectivity and narrow scope. Now, the highly selective manganese-catalysed redox-neutral dehydrosilylation and hydrosilylation of alkenes has been achieved through ligand-tuned metalloradical activity. Whereas an electron-rich bidentate ligand promotes dehydrosilylation, hydrosilylation is the favoured pathway when using an electron-deficient phosphine ligand. DFT calculations have been carried out to understand the observed selectivity.

In situ electrochemical recomposition of decomposed redox-active species in aqueous organic flow batteries

Aqueous organic redox flow batteries offer a safe and potentially inexpensive solution to the problem of storing massive amounts of electricity produced from intermittent renewables. However, molecular decomposition represents a major barrier to commercialization—and although structural modifications can improve stability, it comes at the expense of synthetic cost and molecular weight. Now, utilizing 2,6-dihydroxy-anthraquinone (DHAQ) without further structural modification, we demonstrate that the regeneration of the original molecule after decomposition represents a viable route to achieve low-cost, long-lifetime aqueous organic redox flow batteries. We used in situ (online) NMR and electron paramagnetic resonance, and complementary electrochemical analyses to show that the decomposition compound 2,6-dihydroxy-anthrone (DHA) and its tautomer, 2,6-dihydroxy-anthranol (DHAL) can be recomposed to DHAQ electrochemically through two steps: oxidation of DHA(L)2− to the dimer (DHA)24− by one-electron transfer followed by oxidation of (DHA)24− to DHAQ2− by three-electron transfer per DHAQ molecule. This electrochemical regeneration process also rejuvenates the positive electrolyte—rebalancing the states of charge of both electrolytes without introducing extra ions. Aqueous organic redox flow batteries offer a safe and inexpensive solution to the problem of storing electricity produced from intermittent renewables. However, decomposition of the redox-active organic molecules that they rely on limits their lifetimes, preventing commercialization. Now it has been shown that these redox molecules can be electro-recomposed in situ, rejuvenating their function.

Palladium-catalysed anti-Markovnikov selective oxidative amination

In recent years, the synthesis of amines and other nitrogen-containing motifs has been a major area of research in organic chemistry because they are widely represented in biologically active molecules. Current strategies rely on a multistep approach and require one reactant to be activated prior to the carbon–nitrogen bond formation. This leads to a reaction inefficiency and functional group intolerance. As such, a general approach to the synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds from readily available and benign starting materials is highly desirable. Here we present a palladium-catalysed oxidative amination reaction in which the addition of the nitrogen occurs at the less-substituted carbon of a double bond, in what is known as anti-Markovnikov selectivity. Alkenes are shown to react with imides in the presence of a palladate catalyst to generate the terminal imide through trans-aminopalladation. Subsequently, olefin isomerization occurs to afford the thermodynamically favoured products. Both the scope of the transformation and mechanistic investigations are reported. Aminopalladation is a key step in a number of carbon–nitrogen bond-forming processes, but carrying out this step with intermolecular anti-Markovnikov selectivity has remained difficult. Such a process has now been developed by using an anionic palladium catalyst to generate terminal carbon–nitrogen bonds from alkenes.

A 9.2-GHz clock transition in a Lu(II) molecular spin qubit arising from a 3,467-MHz hyperfine interaction

Spins in molecules are particularly attractive targets for next-generation quantum technologies, enabling chemically programmable qubits and potential for scale-up via self-assembly. Here we report the observation of one of the largest hyperfine interactions for a molecular system, Aiso = 3,467 ± 50 MHz, as well as a very large associated clock transition. This is achieved through chemical control of the degree of s-orbital mixing into the spin-bearing d orbital associated with a series of spin-½ La(II) and Lu(II) complexes. Increased s-orbital character reduces spin–orbit coupling and enhances the electron–nuclear Fermi contact interaction. Both outcomes are advantageous for quantum applications. The former reduces spin–lattice relaxation, and the latter maximizes the hyperfine interaction, which, in turn, generates a 9-GHz clock transition, leading to an increase in phase memory time from 1.0 ± 0.4 to 12 ± 1 μs for one of the Lu(II) complexes. These findings suggest strategies for the development of molecular quantum technologies, akin to trapped ion systems. The s-orbital mixing into the spin-bearing d orbital associated with a molecular Lu(II) complex is shown to both reduce spin–orbit coupling and increase electron–nuclear hyperfine interactions, which substantially improves electron spin coherence. Combined with the potential to tune interactions through coordination chemistry, it makes this system attractive for quantum information applications.

Binding methane to a metal centre

The σ-alkane complexes of transition metals, which contain an essentially intact alkane molecule weakly bound to the metal, have been well established as crucial intermediates in the activation of the strong C–H σ-bonds found in alkanes. Methane, the simplest alkane, binds even more weakly than larger alkanes. Here we report an example of a long-lived methane complex formed by directly binding methane as an incoming ligand to a reactive organometallic complex. Photo-ejection of carbon monoxide from a cationic osmium–carbonyl complex dissolved in an inert hydrofluorocarbon solvent saturated with methane at −90 °C affords an osmium(II) complex, [η5-CpOs(CO)2(CH4)]+, containing methane bound to the metal centre. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirms the identity of the σ-methane complex and shows that the four protons of the metal-bound methane are in rapid exchange with each other. The methane ligand has a characteristically shielded 1H NMR resonance (δ –2.16), and the highly shielded carbon resonance (δ –56.3) shows coupling to the four attached protons (1JC–H = 127 Hz). The methane complex has an effective half-life of about 13 hours at –90 °C. Catalytic transformations of methane frequently involve the formation of a metal–methane complex, but these compounds are challenging to observe. Now, a relatively long-lived osmium–methane complex has been characterized using NMR spectroscopy and forms from the direct binding of methane to a photolytically generated, coordinatively unsaturated cationic osmium–carbonyl complex dissolved in an inert hydrofluorocarbon solvent at –90 °C.

Exploiting the sp2 character of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl radicals in the transition-metal-free multi-component difunctionalization of [1.1.1]propellane

Strained bicyclic substructures are increasingly relevant in medicinal chemistry discovery research because of their role as bioisosteres. Over the last decade, the successful use of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) as a para-disubstituted benzene replacement has made it a highly valuable pharmacophore. However, various challenges, including limited and lengthy access to useful BCP building blocks, are hampering early discovery research. Here we report a single-step transition-metal-free multi-component approach to synthetically versatile BCP boronates. Radicals derived from commonly available carboxylic acids and organohalides perform additions onto [1.1.1]propellane to afford BCP radicals, which then engage in polarity-matched borylation. A wide array of alkyl-, aryl- and alkenyl-functionalized BCP boronates were easily prepared. Late-stage functionalization performed on natural products and approved drugs proceeded with good efficiency to generate the corresponding BCP conjugates. Various photoredox transformations forging C–C and C–N bonds were demonstrated by taking advantage of BCP trifluoroborate salts derived from the BCP boronates. Methods to access bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane building blocks are limited, with current routes requiring multiple steps. Now, a diverse array of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane boronates can be accessed via a multi-component reaction in a single step. Alkyl, aryl and alkenyl substructures can be installed onto bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane boronates by the use of carboxylic acids and organohalides.

Quantum-state-controlled channel branching in cold Ne(3P2)+Ar chemi-ionization

A prerequisite to gain a complete understanding of the most basic aspects of chemical reactions is the ability to perform experiments with complete control over the reactant degrees of freedom. By controlling these, details of a reaction mechanism can be investigated and ultimately manipulated. Here, we present a study of chemi-ionization—a fundamental energy-transfer reaction—under completely controlled conditions. The collision energy of the reagents was tuned from 0.02 K to 1,000 K, with the orientation of the excited Ne atom relative to Ar fully specified by an external magnetic field. Chemi-ionization of Ne(3P2) and Ar in these conditions enables a detailed investigation of how the reaction proceeds, and provides us with a means to control the branching ratio between the two possible reaction outcomes. The merged-beam experimental technique used here allows access to a low-energy regime in which the atoms dynamically reorient into a favourable configuration for reaction, irrespective of their initial orientations. Steric effects in a fundamental energy-transfer reaction at collision energies from over 1,000 K down to 20 mK have now been studied. At high energies a pronounced dependence of the reactivity on the reactant orientation is observed, but this effect is not present at the lowest energies because of dynamic reorientation.

Title: 
Non-intuitive rotational reorientation in collisions of NO(A 2Σ+) with Ne from direct measurement of a four-vector correlation

Stereodynamic descriptions of molecular collisions concern the angular correlations that exist between vector properties of the motion of the participating species, including their velocities and rotational angular momenta. Measurements of vector correlations provide a unique view of the forces acting during collisions, and are a stringent test of electronic-structure calculations of molecular interactions. Here, we present direct measurement of the four-vector correlation between initial and final relative velocities and rotational angular momenta in a molecular collision. This property, which quantifies the extent to which a molecule retains a memory of its initial sense of rotation, or handedness, as a function of scattering angle, yields insight into the dynamics of a molecular collision. We report non-intuitive changes in the handedness for specific states and scattering angles, reproduced by classical and quantum scattering calculations. Comparison to calculations on different ab initio potential energy surfaces demonstrates this measurement’s exquisite sensitivity to the underlying intermolecular forces. Measurements of vector correlations provide insight into the forces acting during molecular collisions, and are a stringent test of electronic-structure calculations. Now, non-intuitive dynamics of molecular collisions have been revealed by measuring the correlation between the relative velocities of the colliders and the molecular rotational angular momentum—before and after the collision—for NO(A 2Σ+) + Ne.

Title: 
Amino-oxetanes as amide isosteres by an alternative defluorosulfonylative coupling of sulfonyl fluorides

Bioisosteres provide valuable design elements that medicinal chemists can use to adjust the structural and pharmacokinetic characteristics of bioactive compounds towards viable drug candidates. Aryl oxetane amines offer exciting potential as bioisosteres for benzamides—extremely common pharmacophores—but are rarely examined due to the lack of available synthetic methods. Here we describe a class of reactions for sulfonyl fluorides to form amino-oxetanes by an alternative pathway to the established SuFEx (sulfonyl–fluoride exchange) click reactivity. A defluorosulfonylation forms planar oxetane carbocations simply on warming. This disconnection, comparable to a typical amidation, will allow the application of vast existing amine libraries. The reaction is tolerant to a wide range of polar functionalities and is suitable for array formats. Ten oxetane analogues of bioactive benzamides and marketed drugs are prepared. Kinetic and computational studies support the formation of an oxetane carbocation as the rate-determining step, followed by a chemoselective nucleophile coupling step. Sulfonyl fluorides typically react with nucleophiles exclusively at sulfur, leading to the substitution of fluoride, as is the case in SuFEx reactions. Now, an alternative defluorosulfonylative reaction has been developed, coupling 3-aryloxetane sulfonyl fluorides with amines to generate amino-oxetanes. The mild conditions and high functional group tolerance enable the preparation of oxetane analogues of benzamide drugs via oxetane carbocation intermediates.

Title: 
Controllable catalytic difluorocarbene transfer enables access to diversified fluoroalkylated arenes

Difluorocarbene has important applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials, but all these applications proceed using just a few types of reaction by taking advantage of its intrinsic electrophilicity. Here, we report a palladium-catalysed strategy that confers the formed palladium difluorocarbene (Pd=CF2) species with both nucleophilicity and electrophilicity by switching the valence state of the palladium centre (Pd(0) and Pd(ii), respectively). Controllable catalytic difluorocarbene transfer occurs between readily available arylboronic acids and the difluorocarbene precursor diethyl bromodifluoromethylphosphonate (BrCF2PO(OEt)2). From just this simple fluorine source, difluorocarbene transfer enables access to four types of product: difluoromethylated and tetrafluoroethylated arenes and their corresponding fluoroalkylated ketones. The transfer can also be applied to the modification of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals as well as the one-pot diversified synthesis of fluorinated compounds. Mechanistic and computational studies consistently reveal that competition between nucleophilic and electrophilic palladium difluorocarbene ([Pd]=CF2) is the key factor controlling the catalytic difluorocarbene transfer. Difluorocarbene transfer is mostly limited to reactions that utilize its intrinsic electrophilicity. Now, a controllable palladium-catalysed difluorocarbene transfer reaction is reported that involves nucleophilic and electrophilic palladium difluorocarbene species. The selective reactions between arylboronic acids and the difluorocarbene precursor BrCF2PO(OEt)2 give four different products—difluoromethylated and tetrafluoroethylated arenes and their corresponding fluoroalkylated ketones.

Title: 
Platinum incorporation into titanate perovskites to deliver emergent active and stable platinum nanoparticles

Platinum functions exceptionally well as a nanoparticulate catalyst in many important fields, such as in the removal of atmospheric pollutants, but it is scarce, expensive and not always sufficiently durable. Here, we report a perovskite system in which 0.5 wt% Pt is integrated into the support and its subsequent conversion through exsolution to achieve a resilient catalyst. Owing to the instability of most Pt oxides at high temperatures, a thermally stable platinum oxide precursor, barium platinate, was used to preserve the platinum as an oxide during the solid-state synthesis in an approach akin to the Trojan horse legend. By tailoring the procedure, it is possible to produce a uniform equilibrated structure with active emergent Pt nanoparticles strongly embedded in the perovskite surface that display better CO oxidation activity and stability than those of conventionally prepared Pt catalysts. This catalyst was further evaluated for a variety of reactions under realistic test environments—CO and NO oxidation, diesel oxidation catalysis and ammonia slip reactions were investigated. Nanoparticulate platinum is a highly active catalyst, but it is scarce, expensive and not always sufficiently durable. Now, barium platinate has been used as a vehicle to preserve platinum as an oxide during the solid-state synthesis of a Pt-doped titanate perovskite; this enables the production of a structure with active and stable Pt nanoparticles on the perovskite surface that catalyses CO oxidation.

Title: 
End-of-life upcycling of polyurethanes using a room temperature, mechanism-based degradation

A major challenge in developing recyclable polymeric materials is the inherent conflict between the properties required during and after their life span. In particular, materials must be strong and durable when in use, but undergo complete and rapid degradation, ideally under mild conditions, as they approach the end of their life span. We report a mechanism for degrading polymers called cyclization-triggered chain cleavage (CATCH cleavage) that achieves this duality. CATCH cleavage features a simple glycerol-based acyclic acetal unit as a kinetic and thermodynamic trap for gated chain shattering. Thus, an organic acid induces transient chain breaks with oxocarbenium ion formation and subsequent intramolecular cyclization to fully depolymerize the polymer backbone at room temperature. With minimal chemical modification, the resulting degradation products from a polyurethane elastomer can be repurposed into strong adhesives and photochromic coatings, demonstrating the potential for upcycling. The CATCH cleavage strategy for low-energy input breakdown and subsequent upcycling may be generalizable to a broader range of synthetic polymers and their end-of-life waste streams. Extensive crosslinking in thermosetting polymers provides their desirable durability but makes them difficult to recycle. Now acetal-based monomers containing nucleophilic pendant groups have been incorporated into polyurethanes, which are stable in aqueous acid yet degradable at room temperature under organic acidic conditions. The degradation products were upcycled into higher-value, long-lasting materials.

Title: 
SuFExable polymers with helical structures derived from thionyl tetrafluoride

Sulfur(vi) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) is a category of click chemistry that enables covalent linking of modular units through sulfur(vi) connective hubs. The efficiency of SuFEx and the stability of the resulting bonds have led to polymer chemistry applications. Now, we report the SuFEx click chemistry synthesis of several structurally diverse SOF4-derived copolymers based on the polymerization of bis(iminosulfur oxydifluorides) and bis(aryl silyl ethers). This polymer class presents two key characteristics. First, the [–N=S(=O)F–O–] polymer backbone linkages are themselves SuFExable and undergo precise SuFEx-based post-modification with phenols or amines to yield branched functional polymers. Second, studies of individual polymer chains of several of these new materials indicate helical polymer structures. The robust nature of SuFEx click chemistry offers the potential for post-polymerization modification, enabling the synthesis of materials with control over composition and conformation. Sulfur(vi) fluoride exchange (SuFEx)—a type of click chemistry that generates SVI-centred covalent linkages—has previously been used for polymer synthesis. Now, modular SuFEx polymerization using SOF4 has been used to generate helical polymers. Unlike previous examples of SuFEx polymerization, the backbone retains SVI–F motifs and therefore is able to undergo further SuFEx click reactions, enabling facile and efficient post-polymerization modification.

Title: 
Identification and characterization of diverse coherences in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex

The idea that excitonic (electronic) coherences are of fundamental importance to natural photosynthesis gained popularity when slowly dephasing quantum beats (QBs) were observed in the two-dimensional electronic spectra of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) complex at 77 K. These were assigned to superpositions of excitonic states, a controversial interpretation, as the strong chromophore–environment interactions in the complex suggest fast dephasing. Although it has been pointed out that vibrational motion produces similar spectral signatures, a concrete assignment of these oscillatory signals to distinct physical processes is still lacking. Here we revisit the coherence dynamics of the FMO complex using polarization-controlled two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, supported by theoretical modelling. We show that the long-lived QBs are exclusively vibrational in origin, whereas the dephasing of the electronic coherences is completed within 240 fs even at 77 K. We further find that specific vibrational coherences are produced via vibronically coupled excited states. The presence of such states suggests that vibronic coupling is relevant for photosynthetic energy transfer. The implications of coherence signals for the transfer of energy within the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex of photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria is a well debated topic. Now, polarization-controlled 2D spectroscopy — aided by vibronic exciton modelling — has enabled the characterization of all such coherences and determination of their physical origins; while electronic coherences dephase extremely rapidly, ground- and excited-state vibrational coherences dominate.

Title: 
An electroaffinity labelling platform for chemoproteomic-based target identification

Target identification involves deconvoluting the protein target of a pharmacologically active, small-molecule ligand, a process that is critical for early drug discovery yet technically challenging. Photoaffinity labelling strategies have become the benchmark for small-molecule target deconvolution, but covalent protein capture requires the use of high-energy ultraviolet light, which can complicate downstream target identification. Thus, there is a strong demand for alternative technologies that allow for controlled activation of chemical probes to covalently label their protein target. Here we introduce an electroaffinity labelling platform that leverages the use of a small, redox-active diazetidinone functional group to enable chemoproteomic-based target identification of pharmacophores within live cell environments. The underlying discovery to enable this platform is that the diazetidinone can be electrochemically oxidized to reveal a reactive intermediate useful for covalent modification of proteins. This work demonstrates the electrochemical platform to be a functional tool for drug-target identification. The covalent capture of a ligand by its target protein(s) is important for drug-target identification. Now an electrochemically active warhead—diazetidinone—can be leveraged in a chemoproteomics platform for electroaffinity labelling of a ligand’s target protein to afford target-ligand identification in live cells.

Title: 
Connecting remote C–H bond functionalization and decarboxylative coupling using simple amines

Transition metal-catalysed C–H functionalization and decarboxylative coupling are two of the most notable synthetic strategies developed in the past 30 years. Here, we connect these two reaction pathways using bases and a simple Pd-based catalyst system to promote a para-selective C–H functionalization reaction from benzylic electrophiles. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest a pathway that involves an uncommon Pd-catalysed dearomatization of the benzyl moiety followed by a base-enabled rearomatization through a formal 1,5-hydrogen migration. This reaction complements ‘C–H activation’ strategies that convert inert C–H bonds into C–metal bonds prior to C–C bond formation. Instead, this reaction exploits an inverted sequence and promotes C–C bond formation prior to deprotonation. These studies provide an opportunity to develop general para-selective C–H functionalization reactions from benzylic electrophiles and show how new reactive modalities may be accessed with careful control of the reaction conditions. A catalytic para-selective alkylation reaction connects C–H functionalization and decarboxylative coupling strategies using simple bases to trap a previously hidden intermediate. This reaction exploits an ‘inverted sequence’ that forms the C–C bond prior to C–H bond cleavage and provides a new entry into C–H functionalization reactions.

Title: 
Non-chemisorbed gold–sulfur binding prevails in self-assembled monolayers

Gold–thiol contacts are ubiquitous across the physical and biological sciences in connecting organic molecules to surfaces. When thiols bind to gold in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) the fate of the hydrogen remains a subject of profound debate—with implications for our understanding of their physical properties, spectroscopic features and formation mechanism(s). Exploiting measurements of the transmission through a molecular junction, which is highly sensitive to the nature of the molecule–electrode contact, we demonstrate here that the nature of the gold–sulfur bond in SAMs can be probed via single-molecule conductance measurements. Critically, we find that SAM measurements of dithiol-terminated molecular junctions yield a significantly lower conductance than solution measurements of the same molecule. Through numerous control experiments, conductance noise analysis and transport calculations based on density functional theory, we show that the gold–sulfur bond in SAMs prepared from the solution deposition of dithiols does not have chemisorbed character, which strongly suggests that under these widely used preparation conditions the hydrogen is retained. Gold–thiol contacts are ubiquitous across the physical and biological sciences, connecting organic molecules to surfaces. Now, conductance measurements of different sulfur-bound single-molecule junctions show that thiols—in contrast to the prevailing view—are not chemisorbed on gold, which strongly suggests that the thiol hydrogen is retained.

Carbopalladation of C–C σ-bonds enabled by strained boronate complexes

Transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions, particularly those mediated by palladium, are some of the most broadly used chemical transformations. The fundamental reaction steps of such cross-couplings typically include oxidative addition, transmetallation, carbopalladation of a π-bond and/or reductive elimination. Herein, we describe an unprecedented fundamental reaction step: a C–C σ-bond carbopalladation. Specifically, an aryl palladium(ii) complex interacts with a σ-bond of a strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl boronate complex to enable addition of the aryl palladium(ii) species and an organoboronic ester substituent across a C–C σ-bond. The overall process couples readily available aryl triflates and organoboronic esters across a cyclobutane unit with total diastereocontrol. The pharmaceutically relevant 1,1,3-trisubstituted cyclobutane products are decorated with an array of modular building blocks, including a boronic ester that can be readily derivatized. Widely used palladium-mediated cross-couplings typically operate via a handful of fundamental reaction steps. Now, the reactivity between palladium and C–C σ-bonds has been described. This carbopalladation enables the coupling of organoboronic esters and aryl triflates across a C–C σ-bond of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane to form disastereomerically pure trisubstituted cyclobutanes.

Title: 
Efficient Lewis acid catalysis of an abiological reaction in a de novo protein scaffold

New enzyme catalysts are usually engineered by repurposing the active sites of natural proteins. Here we show that design and directed evolution can be used to transform a non-natural, functionally naive zinc-binding protein into a highly active catalyst for an abiological hetero-Diels–Alder reaction. The artificial metalloenzyme achieves &gt;104 turnovers per active site, exerts absolute control over reaction pathway and product stereochemistry, and displays a catalytic proficiency (1/KTS = 2.9 × 1010 M−1) that exceeds all previously characterized Diels–Alderases. These properties capitalize on effective Lewis acid catalysis, a chemical strategy for accelerating Diels–Alder reactions common in the laboratory but so far unknown in nature. Extension of this approach to other metal ions and other de novo scaffolds may propel the design field in exciting new directions. A de novo designed zinc-binding protein has been converted into a highly active, stereoselective catalyst for a hetero-Diels–Alder reaction. Design and directed evolution were used to effectively harness Lewis acid catalysis and create an enzyme more proficient than other reported Diels–Alderases.

Title: 
A [4Fe–4S]-Fe(CO)(CN)-l-cysteine intermediate is the first organometallic precursor in [FeFe] hydrogenase H-cluster bioassembly

Biosynthesis of the [FeFe] hydrogenase active site (the 'H-cluster') requires the interplay of multiple proteins and small molecules. Among them, the radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme HydG, a tyrosine lyase, has been proposed to generate a complex that contains an Fe(CO)2(CN) moiety that is eventually incorporated into the H-cluster. Here we describe the characterization of an intermediate in the HydG reaction: a [4Fe–4S][(Cys)Fe(CO)(CN)] species, 'Complex A', in which a CO, a CN− and a cysteine (Cys) molecule bind to the unique 'dangler' Fe site of the auxiliary [5Fe–4S] cluster of HydG. The identification of this intermediate—the first organometallic precursor to the H-cluster—validates the previously hypothesized HydG reaction cycle and provides a basis for elucidating the biosynthetic origin of other moieties of the H-cluster. The biosynthesis of the [FeFe] hydrogenase active site H-cluster requires several Fe–S proteins that perform poorly understood reactions. Now, a reaction intermediate trapped in the enzyme HydG is shown to contain a [(Cys)Fe(CO)(CN)] species identified as the first organometallic Fe moiety en route to the catalytic H-cluster.

Growth of single-crystal imine-linked covalent organic frameworks using amphiphilic amino-acid derivatives in water

A core feature of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is crystallinity, but current crystallization processes rely substantially on trial and error, chemical intuition and large-scale screening, which typically require harsh conditions and low levels of supersaturation, hampering the controlled synthesis of single-crystal COFs, particularly on large scales. Here we report a strategy to produce single-crystal imine-linked COFs in aqueous solutions under ambient conditions using amphiphilic amino-acid derivatives with long hydrophobic chains. We propose that these amphiphilic molecules self-assemble into micelles that serve as dynamic barriers to separate monomers in aqueous solution (nodes) and hydrophobic compartments of the micelles (linkers), thereby regulating the polymerization and crystallization processes. Disordered polyimines were obtained in the micelle, which were then converted into crystals in a step-by-step fashion. Five different three-dimensional COFs and a two-dimensional COF were obtained as single crystals on the gram scale, with yields of 92% and above. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have remained difficult to grow as single crystals. Now, amphiphilic amino-acid derivatives that assemble in micelles in aqueous solutions have been shown to promote the growth of a variety of imine-bridged COFs into single crystals, in a step-by-step fashion, within their hydrophobic compartment.

Title: 
Cu-catalysed enantioselective radical heteroatomic S–O cross-coupling

The transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reaction has established itself as one of the most reliable and practical synthetic tools for the efficient construction of carbon–carbon/heteroatom (p-block elements other than carbon) bonds in both racemic and enantioselective manners. In contrast, development of the corresponding heteroatom–heteroatom cross-couplings has so far remained elusive, probably due to the under-investigated and often challenging heteroatom–heteroatom reductive elimination. Here we demonstrate the use of single-electron reductive elimination as a strategy for developing enantioselective S–O coupling under Cu catalysis, based on both experimental and theoretical results. The reaction manifests its synthetic potential by the ready preparation of challenging chiral alcohols featuring congested stereocentres, the expedient valorization of the biomass-derived feedstock glycerol, and the remarkable catalytic 4,6-desymmetrization of inositol. These results demonstrate the potential of enantioselective radical heteroatomic cross-coupling as a general chiral heteroatom–heteroatom formation strategy. Heteroatom–heteroatom cross-couplings have so far remained elusive. Now, a copper-catalysed enantioselective S–O cross-coupling of diverse diols or triols with sulfonyl chlorides has been realized via a single-electron reductive elimination manifold. The reaction provides access to value-added chiral C3 building blocks and inositol phosphates through enantioselective desymmetrization of biomass-derived alcohols.

The domino hexadehydro-Diels–Alder reaction transforms polyynes to benzynes to naphthynes to anthracynes to tetracynes (and beyond?)

Polyacenes are organic compounds that have multiple, fused, aromatic rings. These highly conjugated molecules often have interesting photonic and/or electronic properties that afford them the potential for application in a host of organoelectronic devices such as sensors, light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic devices and field-effect transistors. Here, we show the development and use of the domino hexadehydro-Diels–Alder reaction to synthesize structurally diverse polyacenes from acyclic polyyne precursors. The key event in these transformations is the successive reaction of multiple 1,3-butadiyne units with a series of in-situ-generated, diynophilic arynes. The polyyne substrates were designed to allow for rapid engagement of each progressively larger aryne following the initiating (and ratelimiting) production of the first reactive intermediate—the benzyne. We show that aryne-trapping reactions are broad in scope and that these cascade or domino processes can be quite efficient. Properly designed polyyne substrates are shown to undergo efficient cascades of thermal cycloaddition reactions initiated by (rate-limiting) benzyne formation. Proceeding through naphthyne, anthracyne or tetracyne intermediates, rapid access to highly fused, polycyclic aromatic compounds can be achieved.

Aqueous interphase formed by CO2 brings electrolytes back to salt-in-water regime

Super-concentrated water-in-salt electrolytes make high-voltage aqueous batteries possible, but at the expense of high cost and several adverse effects, including high viscosity, low conductivity and slow kinetics. Here, we observe a concentration-dependent association between CO2 and TFSI anions in water that reaches maximum strength at 5 mol kg−1 LiTFSI. This TFSI–CO2 complex and its reduction chemistry allow us to decouple the interphasial responsibility of an aqueous electrolyte from its bulk properties, hence making high-voltage aqueous Li-ion batteries practical in dilute salt-in-water electrolytes. The CO2/salt-in-water electrolyte not only inherits the wide electrochemical stability window and non-flammability from water-in-salt electrolytes but also successfully circumvents the numerous disadvantages induced by excessive salt. This work represents a deviation from the water-in-salt pathway that not only benefits the development of practical aqueous batteries, but also highlights how the complex interactions between electrolyte components can be used to manipulate interphasial chemistry. Super-concentrated water-in-salt electrolytes enable high-voltage aqueous batteries, but have considerable drawbacks such as high viscosity, low conductivity and slow kinetics. Now a concentration-dependent association between CO2 and TFSI– has been discovered and leveraged to decouple the interphasial responsibility of an aqueous electrolyte from its bulk properties, making high-voltage aqueous Li-ion batteries practical in dilute salt-in-water electrolytes.

Structural basis for stereoselective dehydration and hydrogen-bonding catalysis by the SAM-dependent pericyclase LepI

LepI is an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent pericyclase that catalyses the formation of the 2-pyridone natural product leporin C. Biochemical characterization has shown that LepI can catalyse stereoselective dehydration to yield a reactive (E)-quinone methide that can undergo bifurcating intramolecular Diels–Alder (IMDA) and hetero-Diels–Alder (HDA) cyclizations from an ambimodal transition state, as well as a [3,3]-retro-Claisen rearrangement to recycle the IMDA product into leporin C. Here, we solve the X-ray crystal structures of SAM-bound LepI and in complex with a substrate analogue, the product leporin C, and a retro-Claisen reaction transition-state analogue to understand the structural basis for the multitude of reactions. Structural and mutational analysis reveals how nature evolves a classic methyltransferase active site into one that can serve as a dehydratase and a multifunctional pericyclase. Catalysis of both sets of reactions employs H133 and R295, two active-site residues that are not found in canonical methyltransferases. An alternative role of SAM, which is not found to be in direct contact with the substrate, is also proposed. LepI is an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent pericyclase that catalyses the dehydration, hetero-Diels–Alder reaction and retro-Claisen rearrangement reactions that occur in the formation of the 2-pyridone natural product leporin C. Now, the mechanistic details that underpin this range of catalytic reactions have been uncovered from the crystal structures of LepI and LepI in complex with ligands.

Title: 
A platinum(ii) metallonitrene with a triplet ground state

Metallonitrenes (M–N) are complexes with a subvalent atomic nitrogen ligand that have been proposed as key reactive intermediates in nitrogen atom transfer reactions. However, in contrast to the common classes of nitride complexes (M≡N) and organic nitrenes (R–N), structurally and spectroscopically well defined ‘authentic’ metallonitrenes with a monovalent atomic nitrogen ligand remain elusive. Here we report that the photolysis of a platinum(ii) pincer azide complex enabled the crystallographic, spectroscopic, magnetic and computational characterization of a metallonitrene that is best described as a singly bonded atomic nitrogen diradical ligand bound to platinum(ii). The photoproduct exhibits selective C–H, B–H and B–C nitrogen atom insertion reactivity. Despite the subvalent metallonitrene character, mechanistic analysis for aldehyde C–H amidation shows nucleophilic reactivity of the N-diradical ligand. Ambiphilic reactivity of the metallonitrene is indicated by reactions with CO and PMe3 to form isocyanate and phosphoraneiminato platinum(ii) complexes, respectively. Transient metallonitrenes (M–N) have been proposed as key intermediates in nitrogen atom transfer reactions, but well-defined examples have remained elusive. Now, a platinum complex with an atomic nitrogen ligand, best described as a subvalent nitrogen diradical singly bonded to a platinum(ii) ion (Pt–N), has been isolated and shows ambiphilic reactivity.

Title: 
Bottlebrush polymers with flexible enantiomeric side chains display differential biological properties

Chirality and molecular conformation are central components of life: biological systems rely on stereospecific interactions between discrete (macro)molecular conformers, and the impacts of stereochemistry and rigidity on the properties of small molecules and biomacromolecules have been intensively studied. Nevertheless, how these features affect the properties of synthetic macromolecules has received comparably little attention. Here we leverage iterative exponential growth and ring-opening metathesis polymerization to produce water-soluble, chiral bottlebrush polymers (CBPs) from two enantiomeric pairs of macromonomers of differing rigidity. Remarkably, CBPs with conformationally flexible, mirror image side chains show several-fold differences in cytotoxicity, cell uptake, blood pharmacokinetics and liver clearance; CBPs with comparably rigid, mirror image side chains show no differences. These observations are rationalized with a simple model that correlates greater conformational freedom with enhanced chiral recognition. Altogether, this work provides routes to the synthesis of chiral nanostructured polymers and suggests key roles for stereochemistry and conformational rigidity in the design of future biomaterials. The contributions of chirality and conformation as contributing factors to the biological properties of synthetic nanomaterials remain underexplored. A synthesis of bottlebrush polymers with mirror-image side chains has now been developed and it has been revealed that an interplay between side-chain absolute configuration and flexibility influences the biological properties of these polymers both in vitro and in vivo.

Entropy compartmentalization stabilizes open host–guest colloidal clathrates

Clathrates are open crystals in which molecules are arranged in a hierarchy of polyhedral cages that encapsulate guest molecules and ions. As well as holding fundamental interest, molecular clathrates serve practical purposes, such as for gas storage, and their colloidal counterparts also appear promising for host–guest applications. Here using Monte Carlo simulations, we report the entropy-driven self-assembly of hard truncated triangular bipyramids into seven different host–guest colloidal clathrate crystals with unit cells ranging from 84 to 364 particles. The structures consist of cages that are either empty or occupied by guest particles, which can be different from or identical to the host particles. The simulations point to crystallization occurring through the compartmentalization of entropy between low- and high-entropy subsystems for the host and the guest particles, respectively. We use entropic bonding theory to design host–guest colloidal clathrates with explicit interparticle attraction, providing a route to realize such systems in the laboratory. Clathrates—open crystals with a hierarchy of polyhedral cages—are mostly found in atomic and molecular systems. Now, it has been shown through Monte Carlo simulations that the formation of colloidal host–guest clathrates can be driven by entropy alone, through entropy compartmentalization.

Nickel-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation of oximes

Chiral hydroxylamines are vital substances in bioscience and versatile subunits in the preparation of a variety of functional molecules. However, asymmetric and non-asymmetric synthetic approaches to these compounds are far from satisfactory. Although atom-economic metal-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenations have been studied for over 50 years, the asymmetric hydrogenation of oximes to the corresponding chiral hydroxylamines remains challenging because of the labile N–O bond and inert C=N bond. Here we report an environmentally friendly, earth-abundant, transition-metal nickel-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation of oximes, affording the corresponding chiral hydroxylamines with up to 99% yield, 99% e.e. and with a substrate/catalyst ratio of 1,000. Computational results indicate that the weak interactions between the catalyst and substrate play crucial roles not only in the transition states, but also during the approach of the substrate to the catalyst, by selectively reducing the reaction barriers and thus improving the reaction efficiency and securing the generation of chirality. The asymmetric hydrogenation of oximes to chiral hydroxylamines is a long-standing challenge because of the labile N–O bond and inert C=N bond. Now, it has been shown that this reaction can be catalysed with a chiral nickel complex, and the weak interactions between catalyst and substrate are found to play a crucial role.

Harnessing chemical energy for the activation and joining of prebiotic building blocks

Life is an out-of-equilibrium system sustained by a continuous supply of energy. In extant biology, the generation of the primary energy currency, adenosine 5′-triphosphate and its use in the synthesis of biomolecules require enzymes. Before their emergence, alternative energy sources, perhaps assisted by simple catalysts, must have mediated the activation of carboxylates and phosphates for condensation reactions. Here, we show that the chemical energy inherent to isonitriles can be harnessed to activate nucleoside phosphates and carboxylic acids through catalysis by acid and 4,5-dicyanoimidazole under mild aqueous conditions. Simultaneous activation of carboxylates and phosphates provides multiple pathways for the generation of reactive intermediates, including mixed carboxylic acid–phosphoric acid anhydrides, for the synthesis of peptidyl–RNAs, peptides, RNA oligomers and primordial phospholipids. Our results indicate that unified prebiotic activation chemistry could have enabled the joining of building blocks in aqueous solution from a common pool and enabled the progression of a system towards higher complexity, foreshadowing today’s encapsulated peptide–nucleic acid system. Life requires a constant supply of energy, but the energy sources that drove the transition from prebiotic chemistry to biochemistry on the early Earth are unknown. Now, a potentially prebiotic chemical activating reagent has been shown to enable the synthesis, in aqueous conditions and catalysed by small molecules, of peptides, peptidyl–RNAs, RNA oligomers and primordial phospholipids.

Bending a photonic wire into a ring

Natural light-harvesting systems absorb sunlight and transfer its energy to the reaction centre, where it is used for photosynthesis. Synthetic chromophore arrays provide useful models for understanding energy migration in these systems. Research has focused on mimicking rings of chlorophyll molecules found in purple bacteria, known as ‘light-harvesting system 2’. Linear meso–meso linked porphyrin chains mediate rapid energy migration, but until now it has not been possible to bend them into rings. Here we show that oligo-pyridyl templates can be used to bend these rod-like photonic wires to create covalent nanorings that consist of 24 porphyrin units and a single butadiyne link. Their elliptical conformations have been probed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. This system exhibits two excited state energy transfer processes: one from a bound template to the peripheral porphyrins and one, in the template-free ring, from the exciton-coupled porphyrin array to the π-conjugated butadiyne-linked porphyrin dimer segment. Meso–meso linked porphyrin arrays have been described as rod-like photonic wires. Now it has been shown that they can be bent into rings using template-directed synthesis. These rings of porphyrins mimic the light-harvesting arrays of chlorophyll molecules responsible for photosynthesis.

Aerobic radical polymerization mediated by microbial metabolism

Performing radical polymerizations under ambient conditions is a major challenge because molecular oxygen is an effective radical quencher. Here we show that the facultative electrogen Shewanella oneidensis can control metal-catalysed living radical polymerizations under apparent aerobic conditions by first consuming dissolved oxygen via aerobic respiration, and then directing extracellular electron flux to a metal catalyst. In both open and closed containers, S. oneidensis enabled living radical polymerizations without requiring the preremoval of oxygen. Polymerization activity was closely tied to S. oneidensis anaerobic metabolism through specific extracellular electron transfer proteins and was effective for a variety of monomers using low (parts per million) concentrations of metal catalysts. Finally, polymerizations survived repeated challenges of oxygen exposure and could be initiated using lyophilized or spent (recycled) cells. Overall, our results demonstrate how the unique ability of S. oneidensis to use both oxygen and metals as respiratory electron acceptors can be leveraged to address salient challenges in polymer synthesis. Oxygen is a potent inhibitor of radical polymerization reactions, but the facultative bacterium Shewanella oneidensis has now been shown to facilitate aerobic radical polymerizations by first consuming dissolved oxygen and then directing extracellular electron flux to a metal catalyst. Aerobic polymerization activity is dependent on the S. oneidensis genotype and can be initiated using lyophilized or spent cells.

Polymerization of silanes through dehydrogenative Si–Si bond formation on metal surfaces

Element–element double bonds of group 14 elements can be formed in solution, but generally only by applying harsh reductive conditions using sterically highly shielded tetryl halides as precursors. The two-dimensional confinement in surface-assisted polymerization represents a valuable alternative to access such reactive compounds, as it allows shielding of the labile entities without requiring bulky residues and catalytic activation of the reactive groups. Here, we demonstrate Si–Si bond formation in on-surface chemistry. Polymerization upon multiple Si–H bond dissociation and subsequent Si–Si bond formation was achieved on Au(111) and Cu(111) surfaces by using two different monomers, each containing two silicon functional groups (CH3SiH2 or SiH3) attached to an aromatic backbone, leading to polymeric disilenes that interact with the surface. A combination of experimental and theoretical studies corroborates the formation of covalent Si–Si bonds between the long, highly ordered polymer chains with high diastereoselectivity. The reactive Si=Si bonds formally generated via double dehydrogenative coupling are stabilized via covalent Si–surface interaction. On-surface dehydrogenative bond formation between sp3-hybridized carbon atoms usually requires high temperatures. Now, it has been shown that the higher homologue, silicon, can undergo dehydrogenative polymerization at room temperature on metal surfaces. This process creates well-ordered structures on Au(111) and Cu(111), with different stereoselectivity depending on the metal.

Chemical evolution of atmospheric organic carbon over multiple generations of oxidation

The evolution of atmospheric organic carbon as it undergoes oxidation has a controlling influence on concentrations of key atmospheric species, including particulate matter, ozone and oxidants. However, full characterization of organic carbon over hours to days of atmospheric processing has been stymied by its extreme chemical complexity. Here we study the multigenerational oxidation of α-pinene in the laboratory, characterizing products with several state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Although quantification of some early&nbsp;generation products remains elusive, full carbon closure is achieved (within measurement uncertainty) by the end of the experiments. These results provide new insights into the effects of oxidation on organic carbon properties (volatility, oxidation state and reactivity) and the atmospheric lifecycle of organic carbon. Following an initial period characterized by functionalization reactions and particle growth, fragmentation reactions dominate, forming smaller species. After approximately one day of atmospheric aging, most carbon is sequestered in two long-lived reservoirs—volatile oxidized gases and low-volatility particulate matter. Nearly all organic carbon has now been quantified and characterized in a highly complex evolving atmospheric system, specifically, the multigenerational oxidation of α-pinene. It has been observed that initial addition of functional groups quickly gives way to fragmentation reactions, with organic carbon ultimately becoming sequestered in chemically resistant reservoirs: organic aerosols and long-lived gas-phase species.

Reaction blockading in a reaction between an excited atom and a charged molecule at low collision energy

Recent advances have enabled studies of atom–ion chemistry at unprecedentedly low temperatures, allowing precision observation of chemical reactions and novel chemical dynamics. So far, these studies have primarily involved reactions between atoms and atomic ions or non-polar molecular ions, often in their electronic ground state. Here, we extend this work by studying an excited atom–polar-molecular-ion chemical reaction (Ca* + BaCl+) at low temperature in a hybrid atom–ion trapping system. The reaction rate and product branching fractions are measured and compared to model calculations as a function of both atomic quantum state and collision energy. At the lowest collision energy we find that the chemical dynamics differ dramatically from capture theory predictions and are primarily dictated by the radiative lifetime of the atomic quantum state instead of the underlying excited-state interaction potential. This reaction blockading effect, which greatly suppresses the reactivity of short-lived excited states, provides a means for directly probing the reaction range and also naturally suppresses unwanted chemical reactions in hybrid trapping experiments. The reaction between an excited atom and a charged molecule has now been studied at low temperature and a reaction blockading effect has been observed that differs significantly from what is expected from standard chemical capture theory.

Supercrystal engineering of atomically precise gold nanoparticles promoted by surface dynamics

The controllable packing of functional nanoparticles (NPs) into crystalline lattices is of interest in the development of NP-based materials. Here we demonstrate that the size, morphology and symmetry of such supercrystals can be tailored by adjusting the surface dynamics of their constituent NPs. In the presence of excess tetraethylammonium cations, atomically precise [Au25(SR)18]− NPs (where SR is a thiolate ligand) can be crystallized into micrometre-sized hexagonal rod-like supercrystals, rather than as face-centred-cubic superlattices otherwise. Experimental characterization supported by theoretical modelling shows that the rod-like crystals consist of polymeric chains in which Au25 NPs are held together by a linear SR–[Au(I)–SR]4 interparticle linker. This linker is formed by conjugation of two dynamically detached SR–[Au(I)–SR]2 protecting motifs from adjacent Au25 particles, and is stabilized by a combination of CH⋯π and ion-pairing interactions between tetraethylammonium cations and SR ligands. The symmetry, morphology and size of the resulting supercrystals can be systematically tuned by changing the concentration and type of the tetraalkylammonium cations. Gold nanoparticles typically exhibit hard-sphere-like assembly behaviour, but now the size, morphology and symmetry of crystals of Au25 nanoparticles have been tuned. The presence of excess tetraethylammonium cations has been shown to promote the one-dimensional assembly of the nanoparticles, which in turn form rod-like crystals, by stabilizing dynamically detached ligands from adjacent particles into interparticle linkers through CH⋯π and ion-pairing interactions.

Tunable exciton binding energy in 2D hybrid layered perovskites through donor–acceptor interactions within the organic layer

The strength of electrostatic interactions within semiconductors strongly affects their performance in optoelectronic devices. An important target is the tuning of a material’s exciton binding energy—the energy binding an electron–hole pair through the electrostatic Coulomb force—independent of its electronic band gap. Here, we report on the doping of a family of two-dimensional hybrid perovskites, in which inorganic lead halide sheets alternate with naphthalene-based organic layers, with tetrachloro-1,2-benzoquinone (TCBQ). For four out of seven n = 1 perovskites, the incorporation of the electron-accepting TCBQ dopant into the organic sublattice containing the electron-donating naphthalene species enabled the tuning of the materials’ 1s exciton binding energy. The naphthalene–TCBQ electron donor–acceptor interactions increased the electrostatic screening of the exciton, in turn lowering its binding energy relative to the undoped perovskite—by almost 50% in one system. Structural and optical characterization showed that the inorganic lattice is not significantly perturbed even though the layer-to-layer spacing increases upon molecular dopant incorporation. The strength of electrostatic interactions in semiconductors strongly affects their performance in optoelectronic devices. Now, doping two-dimensional naphthalene-based lead halide perovskites with tetrachloro-1,2-benzoquinone has been shown to introduce donor–acceptor interactions within the organic network, without disrupting the inorganic sublattice. This in turn altered the energy of the materials’ electron–hole electrostatic Coulomb interactions.

Integrating programmable DNAzymes with electrical readout for rapid and culture-free bacterial detection using a handheld platform

The detection and identification of bacteria currently rely on enrichment steps such as bacterial culture and nucleic acid amplification to increase the concentration of target analytes. These steps increase assay time, cost and complexity, making it difficult to realize a truly rapid point-of-care test. Here we report the development of an electrical assay that uses electroactive RNA-cleaving DNAzymes (e-RCDs) to identify specific bacterial targets and subsequently release a DNA barcode for transducing a signal onto an electrical chip. Integrating e-RCDs into a two-channel electrical chip with nanostructured electrodes provides the analytical sensitivity and specificity needed for clinical analysis. The e-RCD assay is capable of detecting 10 CFU (equivalent to 1,000 CFU ml–1) of Escherichia coli selectively from a panel containing multiple non-specific bacterial species. Clinical evaluation of this assay using 41 patient urine samples demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 78% at an analysis time of less than one hour compared with the several hours needed for currently used culture-based methods. Methods to detect and identify bacteria typically rely on enrichment steps such as bacterial culture and nucleic acid amplification. Now, an assay for detecting bacteria based on a two-channel electrical chip that combines electroactive DNAzymes with an electrochemical readout, has been developed. This assay enables reagentless and culture-free detection of bacteria in clinical samples.

Title: 
Mining the cellular inventory of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes with functionalized cofactor mimics

Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is an enzyme cofactor required for the chemical transformation of biological amines in many central cellular processes. PLP-dependent enzymes (PLP-DEs) are ubiquitous and evolutionarily diverse, making their classification based on sequence homology challenging. Here we present a chemical proteomic method for reporting on PLP-DEs using functionalized cofactor probes. We synthesized pyridoxal analogues modified at the 2′-position, which are taken up by cells and metabolized in situ. These pyridoxal analogues are phosphorylated to functional cofactor surrogates by cellular pyridoxal kinases and bind to PLP-DEs via an aldimine bond which can be rendered irreversible by NaBH4 reduction. Conjugation to a reporter tag enables the subsequent identification of PLP-DEs using quantitative, label-free mass spectrometry. Using these probes we accessed a significant portion of the Staphylococcus aureus PLP-DE proteome (73%) and annotate uncharacterized proteins as novel PLP-DEs. We also show that this approach can be used to study structural tolerance within PLP-DE active sites and to screen for off-targets of the PLP-DE inhibitor d-cycloserine. A chemical proteomic strategy has now been developed for profiling pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzymes (PLP-DEs) in cells. Pyridoxal-based probes are phosphorylated in situ and bind to cellular PLP-DEs as cofactor mimics. The method accessed 73% of the Staphylococcus aureus PLP-dependent proteome and annotated uncharacterized proteins as novel PLP-DEs.

Catalytic C(sp3)–H bond activation in tertiary alkylamines

The development of robust catalytic methods to assemble tertiary alkylamines provides a continual challenge to chemical synthesis. In this regard, transformation of a traditionally unreactive C–H bond, proximal to the nitrogen atom, into a versatile chemical entity would be a powerful strategy for introducing functional complexity to tertiary alkylamines. A practical and selective metal-catalysed C(sp3)–H activation facilitated by the tertiary alkylamine functionality, however, remains an unsolved problem. Here, we report a Pd(ii)-catalysed protocol that appends arene feedstocks to tertiary alkylamines via C(sp3)–H functionalization. A simple ligand for Pd(ii) orchestrates the C–H activation step in favour of deleterious pathways. The reaction can use both simple and complex starting materials to produce a range of multifaceted γ-aryl tertiary alkylamines and can be rendered enantioselective. The enabling features of this transformation should be attractive to practitioners of synthetic and medicinal chemistry as well as in other areas that use biologically active alkylamines. A practical and selective palladium-catalysed process for C(sp3)–H arylation of tertiary alkylamines is enabled by the use of a simple amino acid-derived ligand. The reaction combines a range of multifaceted tertiary alkylamines with readily available aryl-boronic acids to form γ-aryl tertiary alkylamines and can also be performed enantioselectively.

Title: 
Thermally activated delayed photoluminescence from pyrenyl-functionalized CdSe quantum dots

The generation and transfer of triplet excitons across semiconductor nanomaterial–molecular interfaces will play an important role in emerging photonic and optoelectronic technologies, and understanding the rules that govern such phenomena is essential. The ability to cooperatively merge the photophysical properties of semiconductor quantum dots with those of well-understood and inexpensive molecular chromophores is therefore paramount. Here we show that 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid-functionalized CdSe quantum dots undergo thermally activated delayed photoluminescence. This phenomenon results from a near quantitative triplet–triplet energy transfer from the nanocrystals to 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid, producing a molecular triplet-state ‘reservoir’ that thermally repopulates the photoluminescent state of CdSe through endothermic reverse triplet–triplet energy transfer. The photoluminescence properties are systematically and predictably tuned through variation of the quantum dot–molecule energy gap, temperature and the triplet-excited-state lifetime of the molecular adsorbate. The concepts developed are likely to be applicable to semiconductor nanocrystals interfaced with molecular chromophores, enabling potential applications of their combined excited states. The ability to merge the photophysical properties of semiconductor quantum dots with those of well-understood and inexpensive molecular chromophores is important for the development of various emerging photonic and optoelectronic technologies. Now, 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid-functionalized CdSe quantum dots have been shown to undergo thermally activated delayed photoluminescence and display tunable photophysical properties.

Micrometre-long covalent organic fibres by photoinitiated chain-growth radical polymerization on an alkali-halide surface

On-surface polymerization is a promising technique to prepare organic functional nanomaterials that are challenging to synthesize in solution, but it is typically used on metal substrates, which play a catalytic role. Previous examples on insulating surfaces have involved intermediate self-assembled structures, which face high barriers to diffusion, or annealing to higher temperatures, which generally causes rapid dewetting and desorption of the monomers. Here we report the photoinitiated radical polymerization, initiated from a two-dimensional gas phase, of a dimaleimide monomer on an insulating KCl surface. Polymer fibres up to 1 μm long are formed through chain-like rather than step-like growth. Interactions between potassium cations and the dimaleimide’s oxygen atoms facilitate the propagation of the polymer fibres along a preferred axis of the substrate over long distances. Density functional theory calculations, non-contact atomic force microscopy imaging and manipulations at room temperature were used to explore the initiation and propagation processes, as well as the structure and stability of the resulting one-dimensional polymer fibres. On-surface polymerization is a promising technique to prepare organic functional nanomaterials, but it has remained difficult to carry out on insulating surfaces. Now, the photoinitiated radical polymerization of dimaleimide on KCl, initiated from a two-dimensional gas phase and guided by molecule–substrate interactions, has led to polymer fibres up to 1 μm long.

Polyoxometalates as ligands to synthesize, isolate and characterize compounds of rare isotopes on the microgram scale

The synthesis and study of radioactive compounds are both inherently limited by their toxicity, cost and isotope scarcity. Traditional methods using small inorganic or organic complexes typically require milligrams of sample—per attempt—which for some isotopes is equivalent to the world’s annual supply. Here we demonstrate that polyoxometalates (POMs) enable the facile formation, crystallization, handling and detailed characterization of metal–ligand complexes from microgram quantities owing to their high molecular weight and controllable solubility properties. Three curium–POM complexes were prepared, using just 1–10 μg per synthesis of the rare isotope 248Cm3+, and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, showing an eight-coordinated Cm3+ centre. Moreover, spectrophotometric, fluorescence, NMR and Raman analyses of several f-block element–POM complexes, including 243Am3+ and 248Cm3+, showed otherwise unnoticeable differences between their solution versus solid-state chemistry, and actinide versus lanthanide behaviour. This POM-driven strategy represents a viable path to isolate even rarer complexes, notably with actinium or transcalifornium elements. The study of rare isotopes is hampered by their scarcity, cost and sometimes toxicity. Now polyoxometalate ligands have been shown to facilitate the capture of f-block elements and their characterization. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures have been obtained for several molecular complexes, including three of the rare curium-248, from minute amounts (micrograms) of material.

Nanoparticle stereochemistry-dependent endocytic processing improves in vivo mRNA delivery

Stereochemistry can alter small-molecule pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy. However, it is unclear whether the stereochemistry of a single compound within a multicomponent colloid such as a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) can influence its activity in vivo. Here we report that LNPs containing stereopure 20α-hydroxycholesterol (20α) delivered mRNA to liver cells up to 3-fold more potently than LNPs containing a mixture of both 20α- and 20β-hydroxycholesterols (20mix). This effect was not driven by LNP physiochemical traits. Instead, in vivo single-cell RNA sequencing and imaging revealed that 20mix LNPs were sorted into phagocytic pathways more than 20α LNPs, resulting in key differences between LNP biodistribution and subsequent LNP functional delivery. These data are consistent with the fact that nanoparticle biodistribution is necessary, but not sufficient, for mRNA delivery, and that stereochemistry-dependent interactions between LNPs and target cells can improve mRNA delivery. Stereochemistry can affect the reactivity and transport properties of small molecules; however, it is unclear whether the stereochemistry of components in a lipid nanoparticle influences its activity in vivo. Now, it has been shown that lipid nanoparticles made with a stereopure component can increase delivery of mRNA. A biological mechanism driving the effect is also proposed.

Expedited mapping of the ligandable proteome using fully functionalized enantiomeric probe pairs

A fundamental challenge in chemical biology and medicine is to understand and expand the fraction of the human proteome that can be targeted by small molecules. We recently described a strategy that integrates fragment-based ligand discovery with chemical proteomics to furnish global portraits of reversible small-molecule/protein interactions in human cells. Excavating clear structure–activity relationships from these ‘ligandability’ maps, however, was confounded by the distinct physicochemical properties and corresponding overall protein-binding potential of individual fragments. Here, we describe a compelling solution to this problem by introducing a next-generation set of fully functionalized fragments differing only in absolute stereochemistry. Using these enantiomeric probe pairs, or ‘enantioprobes’, we identify numerous stereoselective protein–fragment interactions in cells and show that these interactions occur at functional sites on proteins from diverse classes. Our findings thus indicate that incorporating chirality into fully functionalized fragment libraries provides a robust and streamlined method to discover ligandable proteins in cells. A set of enantioprobes—photoreactive, clickable fragment pairs differing only in absolute stereochemistry—have been used to provide a robust and streamlined chemical proteomic map of small-molecule/protein interactions in human cells. More than 170 stereoselective fragment–protein interactions were discovered and shown to occur at functional sites on proteins from diverse classes.

Identification of a Frank–Kasper Z phase from shape amphiphile self-assembly

Frank–Kasper phases, a family of ordered structures formed from particles with spherical motifs, are found in a host of materials, such as metal alloys, inorganic colloids and various types of soft matter. All the experimentally observed Frank–Kasper phases can be constructed from the basic units of three fundamental structures called the A15, C15 and Z phases. The Z phase, typically observed in metal alloys, is associated with a relatively large volume ratio between its constituents, and this constraint inhibits its formation in most self-assembled single-component soft-matter systems. We have assembled a series of nanosized shape amphiphiles that comprise a triphenylene core and six polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane cages grafted onto it through linkers to give a variety of unconventional structures, which include the Z phase. This structure was obtained through fine tuning of the linker lengths between the core and the peripheral polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane cages, and exhibits a relatively large volume asymmetry between its constituent polyhedral particle motifs. The Z phase, one of three fundamental Frank–Kasper phases—topologically close-packed structures commonly found in metal alloys—is associated with a relatively large volume ratio between its constituents. This means it is typically not formed in single-component soft materials. Now, a shape amphiphile has been shown to self-assemble in a variety of unconventional structures, including the Z phase.

Substantial π-aromaticity in the anionic heavy-metal cluster [Th@Bi12]4−

The concept of aromaticity was originally defined as a property of unsaturated, cyclic planar organic molecules like benzene, which gain stability by the inherent delocalization of 4n + 2 π-electrons over the ring atoms. Since then, π-aromaticity has been observed for a large variety of organic and inorganic non-metal compounds, yet, for molecules consisting only of metal atoms, it has remained restricted to systems with three to five atoms. Here, we present the straightforward synthesis of a metal 12-ring that exhibits 2π-aromaticity and has a ring current much stronger than that of benzene (6π) and equivalent to that of porphine (26π), despite these organic molecules having (much) larger numbers of π-electrons. Highly reducing reaction conditions allowed access to the heterometallic anion [Th@Bi12]4−, with interstitial Th4+ stabilizing a Bi128− moiety. Our results show that it is possible to design and generate substantial π-aromaticity in large metal rings, and we hope that such π-aromatic heavy-metal cycles will eventually find use in cluster-based reactions. A wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds show π-aromaticity, yet for all-metal systems it has remained restricted to compounds with three to five atoms. Now, the anionic cluster [Th@Bi12]4− has been shown to exhibit π-aromaticity, with a significant ring current despite relying on the delocalization of only two π-electrons.

O2−O2 and O2−N2 collision-induced absorption mechanisms unravelled

Collision-induced absorption is the phenomenon in which interactions between colliding molecules lead to absorption of light, even for transitions that are forbidden for the isolated molecules. Collision-induced absorption contributes to the atmospheric heat balance and is important for the electronic excitations of O2 that are used for remote sensing. Here, we present a theoretical study of five vibronic transitions in O2−O2 and O2−N2, using analytical models and numerical quantum scattering calculations. We unambiguously identify the underlying absorption mechanism, which is shown to depend explicitly on the collision partner—contrary to textbook knowledge. This explains experimentally observed qualitative differences between O2−O2 and O2−N2 collisions in the overall intensity, line shape and vibrational dependence of the absorption spectrum. It is shown that these results can be used to discriminate between conflicting experimental data and even to identify unphysical results, thus impacting future experimental studies and atmospheric applications. Molecular collisions can lead to the absorption of incident light even for transitions that are spectroscopically forbidden for the isolated molecules. Now the electronic–vibrational transitions of O2 have been theoretically studied and, contrary to textbook knowledge, it is shown that the absorption mechanism and the spectral line shape depend on the collision partner, oxygen or nitrogen.

Accelerating symmetry-breaking charge separation in a perylenediimide trimer through a vibronically coherent dimer intermediate

Understanding the photophysics and photochemistry of molecular π-stacked chromophores is important for utilizing them as functional photonic materials. However, these investigations have been mostly limited to covalent molecular dimers, which can only approximate the electronic and vibronic interactions present in the higher oligomers typical of functional organic materials. Here we show that a comparison of the excited-state dynamics of a covalent slip-stacked perylenediimide dimer (2) and trimer (3) provides fundamental insights into electronic state mixing and symmetry-breaking charge separation (SB-CS) beyond the dimer limit. We find that coherent vibronic coupling to high-frequency modes facilitates ultrafast state mixing between the Frenkel exciton (FE) and charge-transfer (CT) states. Subsequently, solvent fluctuations and interchromophore low-frequency vibrations promote CT character in the coherent FE/CT mixed state. The coherent FE/CT mixed state persists in 2, but, in 3, low-frequency vibronic coupling collapses the coherence, resulting in ultrafast SB-CS between the distal perylenediimide units. Molecular π-stacked chromophores are promising photonic materials, but much of our understanding is limited to covalent dimers. Now it has been shown that, in a slip-stacked perylenediimide trimer, coherent vibronic coupling to high-frequency modes facilitates ultrafast state mixing between the Frenkel exciton and charge-transfer states, which then collapses by solvent fluctuations and low-frequency vibronic coupling, resulting in ultrafast symmetry-breaking charge separation.

Frequency chasing of individual megadalton ions in an Orbitrap analyser improves precision of analysis in single-molecule mass spectrometry

To enhance the performance of charge-detection mass spectrometry, we investigated the behaviour of macromolecular single ions on their paths towards and within the Orbitrap analyser. Ions with a mass beyond one megadalton reach a plateau of stability and can be successfully trapped for seconds, travelling a path length of multiple kilometres, thereby enabling precise mass analysis with an effective resolution of greater than 100,000 at a mass-to-charge ratio of 35,000. Through monitoring the frequency of individual ions, we show that these high-mass ions, rather than being lost from the trap, can gradually lose residual solvent molecules and, in rare cases, a single elementary charge. We also demonstrate that the frequency drift of single ions due to desolvation and charge stripping can be corrected, which improves the effective ion sampling 23-fold and gives a twofold improvement in mass precision and resolution. The mass precision and resolution in charge-detection mass spectrometry can be improved by correcting frequency drifts of single ions. Now, chasing these individual ions for seconds in an Orbitrap mass spectrometer has revealed the exceptional stability of ultra-high-mass ions, culminating in an effective resolution of greater than 100,000 at m/z = 35,000.

A programmable polymer library that enables the construction of stimuli-responsive nanocarriers containing logic gates

Stimuli-responsive biomaterials that contain logic gates hold great potential for detecting and responding to pathological markers as part of clinical therapies. However, a major barrier is the lack of a generalized system that can be used to easily assemble different ligand-responsive units to form programmable nanodevices for advanced biocomputation. Here we develop a programmable polymer library by including responsive units in building blocks with similar structure and reactivity. Using these polymers, we have developed a series of smart nanocarriers with hierarchical structures containing logic gates linked to self-immolative motifs. Designed with disease biomarkers as inputs, our logic devices showed site-specific release of multiple therapeutics (including kinase inhibitors, drugs and short interfering RNA) in vitro and in vivo. We expect that this ‘plug and play’ platform will be expanded towards smart biomaterial engineering for therapeutic delivery, precision medicine, tissue engineering and stem cell therapy. A programmable polymer library that responds to external and internal stimuli has been developed and used to fabricate a series of nanocarriers for drug release. The carriers respond to disease biomarkers, triggering self-immolative motifs and leading to the site-specific release of therapeutics both in vitro and in vivo.

Solvents can control solute molecular identity

For solution-phase chemical reactions, the solvent is often considered simply as a medium to allow the reactants to encounter each other by diffusion. Although examples of direct solvent effects on molecular solutes exist, such as the compression of solute bonding electrons due to Pauli repulsion interactions, the solvent is not usually considered a part of the chemical species of interest. We show, using quantum simulations of Na2, that when there are local specific interactions between a solute and solvent that are energetically on the same order as a hydrogen bond, the solvent controls not only the bond dynamics but also the chemical identity of the solute. In tetrahydrofuran, dative bonding interactions between the solvent and Na atoms lead to unique coordination states that must cross a free energy barrier of ~8 kBT—undergoing a chemical reaction—to interconvert. Each coordination state has its own dynamics and spectroscopic signatures, highlighting the importance of considering the solvent in the identity of condensed-phase chemical systems. Mixed quantum–classical molecular dynamics simulations of Na2 in liquid tetrahydrofuran have revealed that when local specific interactions between a solute and solvent are energetically on the same order as a hydrogen bond, the solvent controls not only bond dynamics but also the chemical identity of simple solutes.

A two-residue nascent-strand steric gate controls synthesis of 2′-O-methyl- and 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)-RNA

Steric exclusion is a key element of enzyme substrate specificity, including in polymerases. Such substrate specificity restricts the enzymatic synthesis of 2′-modified nucleic acids, which are of interest in nucleic-acid-based drug development. Here we describe the discovery of a two-residue, nascent-strand, steric control ‘gate’ in an archaeal DNA polymerase. We show that engineering of the gate to reduce steric bulk in the context of a previously described RNA polymerase activity unlocks the synthesis of 2′-modified RNA oligomers, specifically the efficient synthesis of both defined and random-sequence 2′-O-methyl-RNA (2′OMe-RNA) and 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)-RNA (MOE-RNA) oligomers up to 750 nt. This enabled the discovery of RNA endonuclease catalysts entirely composed of 2′OMe-RNA (2′OMezymes) for the allele-specific cleavage of oncogenic KRAS (G12D) and β-catenin CTNNB1 (S33Y) mRNAs, and the elaboration of mixed 2′OMe-/MOE-RNA aptamers with high affinity for vascular endothelial growth factor. Our results open up these 2′-modified RNAs—used in several approved nucleic acid therapeutics—for enzymatic synthesis and a wider exploration in directed evolution and nanotechnology. Sterically demanding 2′-modified nucleotides used in antisense therapeutics have thus far been challenging to synthesise enzymatically. Now, it has been shown that mutation of two gatekeeper residues in an archaeal DNA polymerase unlocks efficient synthesis of the modified nucleic acid oligomers 2′-O-methyl-RNA and 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)-RNA and enables the evolution of 2′-O-methyl-RNA enzymes.

State-to-state scattering of highly vibrationally excited NO at broadly tunable energies

Experimental developments continue to challenge the theoretical description of molecular interactions. One key arena in which these advances have taken place is in rotationally inelastic scattering. Electric fields have been used with great success to select the initial quantum state and slow molecules for scattering studies, revealing novel stereodynamics, diffraction oscillations and scattering resonances. These have enjoyed excellent agreement with quantum scattering calculations performed on state-of-the-art coupled-cluster potential energy surfaces. To date these studies have largely employed reactants in the ground vibrational state (v = 0) and the lowest low-field-seeking quantum state. Here we describe the use of stimulated emission pumping to prepare NO molecules in arbitrary single rotational and parity states of v = 10 for inelastic scattering studies. These are employed in a near-copropagating molecular beam geometry that permits the collision energy to be tuned from above room temperature to 1 K or below, with product differential cross-sections obtained by velocity map imaging. This extremely nonequilibrium condition, not found in nature, tests current theoretical methods in a new regime. Scattering experiments in which two beams nearly co-propagate allow broadly tunable collision energies and can enable cold collisions. Now, such experiments have been combined with the preparation of NO molecules using stimulated emission to generate highly vibrationally excited states for state-to-state scattering studies, testing the theoretical gold standard in a regime not found in nature.

Hierarchical organization of perylene bisimides and polyoxometalates for photo-assisted water oxidation

The oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere is there primarily because of water oxidation performed by photosynthetic organisms using solar light and one specialized protein complex, photosystem II (PSII). High-resolution imaging of the PSII ‘core’ complex shows the ideal co-localization of multi-chromophore light-harvesting antennas with the functional reaction centre. Man-made systems are still far from replicating the complexity of PSII, as the majority of PSII mimetics have been limited to photocatalytic dyads based on a 1:1 ratio of a light absorber, generally a Ru–polypyridine complex, with a water oxidation catalyst. Here we report the self-assembly of multi-perylene-bisimide chromophores (PBI) shaped to function by interaction with a polyoxometalate water-oxidation catalyst (Ru4POM). The resulting [PBI]5Ru4POM complex shows a robust amphiphilic structure and dynamic aggregation into large two-dimensional paracrystalline domains, a redshifted light-harvesting efficiency of &gt;40% and favourable exciton accumulation, with a peak quantum efficiency using ‘green’ photons (λ &gt; 500 nm). The modularity of the building blocks and the simplicity of the non-covalent chemistry offer opportunities for innovation in artificial photosynthesis. In native photosystem II (PSII), multi-chromophore antennas surround the reaction centre, capturing light and triggering the quantized (four-flashes) photo-oxidation of water to oxygen. The PSII ‘quantasome’ is the most efficient photo-electrolyser built so far. An artificial quantasome has now been developed; it is specifically designed for oxygen evolution by self-assembling light-harvesting-perylene bisimides with a ruthenium polyoxometalate water-oxidation catalyst.

Dopant-induced electron localization drives CO2 reduction to C2 hydrocarbons

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon products has attracted much attention because it provides an avenue to the synthesis of value-added carbon-based fuels and feedstocks using renewable electricity. Unfortunately, the efficiency of CO2 conversion to C2 products remains below that necessary for its implementation at scale. Modifying the local electronic structure of copper with positive valence sites has been predicted to boost conversion to C2 products. Here, we use boron to tune the ratio of Cuδ+ to Cu0 active sites and improve both stability and C2-product generation. Simulations show that the ability to tune the average oxidation state of copper enables control over CO adsorption and dimerization, and makes it possible to implement a preference for the electrosynthesis of C2 products. We report experimentally a C2 Faradaic efficiency of 79 ± 2% on boron-doped copper catalysts and further show that boron doping leads to catalysts that are stable for in excess of ~40 hours while electrochemically reducing CO2 to multi-carbon hydrocarbons. On copper catalysts, Cuδ+ sites play a key role in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to C2 hydrocarbons, however, they are prone to being reduced (to Cu0) themselves. Now, a Cuδ+-based catalyst is reported that is stable for in excess of ~40 hours while electrochemically reducing CO2 to multi-carbon hydrocarbons and that exhibits a Faradaic efficiency for C2 of ~80%.

Braiding, branching and chiral amplification of nanofibres in supramolecular gels

Helical nanofibres play key roles in many biological processes. Entanglements between helices can aid gelation by producing thick, interconnected fibres, but the details of this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe the assembly of an achiral oligo(urea) peptidomimetic compound into supramolecular helices. Aggregation of adjacent helices leads to the formation of fibrils, which further intertwine to produce high-fidelity braids with periodic crossing patterns. A braid theory analysis suggests that braiding is governed by rigid topological constraints, and that branching occurs due to crossing defects in the developing braids. Mixed-chirality helices assemble into relatively complex, odd-stranded braids, but can also form helical bundles by undergoing inversions of chirality. The oligo(urea) assemblies are also highly sensitive to chiral amplification, proposed to occur through a majority-rules mechanism, whereby trace chiral materials can promote the formation of gels containing only homochiral helices. Helical structures play important roles in biological processes, yet their aggregation into fibres—which can in turn form gels—is poorly understood. Now, the self-assembly of a linear pentakis (urea) peptidomimetic compound into helices that further intertwine into well-defined braided structures has been described and analysed through braid theory. Homochiral gels may be formed by exposing the precursor sol to a chiral material.

Large magnetic exchange coupling in rhombus-shaped nanographenes with zigzag periphery

Nanographenes with zigzag edges are predicted to manifest non-trivial π-magnetism resulting from the interplay of concurrent electronic effects, such as hybridization of localized frontier states and Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. This provides a chemically tunable platform to explore quantum magnetism at the nanoscale and opens avenues towards organic spintronics. The magnetic stability in nanographenes is thus far greatly limited by the weak magnetic exchange coupling, which remains below the room-temperature thermal energy. Here, we report the synthesis of large rhombus-shaped nanographenes with zigzag peripheries on gold and copper surfaces. Single-molecule scanning probe measurements show an emergent magnetic spin singlet ground state with increasing nanographene size. The magnetic exchange coupling in the largest nanographene (C70H22, containing five benzenoid rings along each edge), determined by inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy, exceeds 100 meV or 1,160 K, which outclasses most inorganic nanomaterials and survives on a metal electrode. Open-shell nanographenes are promising for quantum technologies, but their magnetic stability has remained limited by weak exchange coupling. Now, two large rhombus-shaped nanographenes with zigzag peripheries, one with 48 carbon atoms and the other with 70, have been synthesized on gold and copper surfaces. The 70-carbon compound exhibits a large magnetic exchange coupling exceeding 100 meV.

Palladium-catalysed carboformylation of alkynes using acid chlorides as a dual carbon monoxide and carbon source

Hydroformylation, a reaction that installs both a C–H bond and an aldehyde group across an unsaturated substrate, is one of the most important catalytic reactions in both industry and academia. Given the synthetic importance of creating new C–C bonds, the development of carboformylation reactions, wherein a new C–C bond is formed instead of a C–H bond, would bear enormous synthetic potential to rapidly increase molecular complexity in the synthesis of valuable aldehydes. However, the demanding complexity inherent in a four-component reaction, utilizing an exogenous CO source, has made the development of a direct carboformylation reaction a formidable challenge. Here, we describe a palladium-catalysed strategy that uses readily available aroyl chlorides as a carbon electrophile and CO source, in tandem with a sterically congested hydrosilane, to perform a stereoselective carboformylation of alkynes. An extension of this protocol to four chemodivergent carbonylations further highlights the creative opportunity offered by this strategy in carbonylation chemistry. In an effort to extend the important hydroformylation reaction, a palladium-catalysed carboformylation reaction has now been developed in which two new carbon–carbon bonds are created across an alkyne. This modular reaction relies on a CO shuffling process and uses an acid chloride as a dual carbon and CO source.

Title: 
Organocatalyst-controlled site-selective arene C–H functionalization

Over the past three decades, organocatalysis has emerged as a powerful catalysis platform and has gradually been incorporated into the routine synthetic toolbox to obtain chiral molecules. However, its application in the site- and enantioselective functionalization of inactive aryl C–H bonds remains in its infancy. Here, we present an organocatalyst-controlled para-selective arene C–H functionalization strategy that addresses this issue, which remains an enduring challenge in arene functionalization chemistry. By emulating enzyme catalysis, the chiral phosphoric acid catalyst offers an ideal chiral environment for stereoinduction, and the projecting substituents give control of chemo- and site-selectivity. Various types of nucleophile are compatible with this method, affording more than 100 para-selective adducts with stereodefined carbon centres or axes in viable molecular contexts. This protocol is expected to provide a general strategy for para-selective functionalization of arene C–H bonds in a controlled manner. Although organocatalysis has emerged as a powerful catalysis platform, its application for the selective transformation of inactive arenes remains challenging. Now, an organocatalyst-controlled site-selective C–H functionalization of arenes has been developed, with wide substrate generality and applicability, offering a general strategy for arene transformation.

Title: 
A locally activatable sensor for robust quantification of organellar glutathione

Glutathione (GSH) is the main determinant of intracellular redox potential and participates in multiple cellular signalling pathways. Achieving a detailed understanding of intracellular GSH homeostasis depends on the development of tools to map GSH compartmentalization and intra-organelle fluctuations. Here we present a GSH-sensing platform for live-cell imaging, termed targetable ratiometric quantitative GSH (TRaQ-G). This chemogenetic sensor possesses a unique reactivity turn-on mechanism, ensuring that the small molecule is only sensitive to GSH in a desired location. Furthermore, TRaQ-G can be fused to a fluorescent protein to give a ratiometric response. Using TRaQ-G fused to a redox-insensitive fluorescent protein, we demonstrate that the nuclear and cytosolic GSH pools are independently regulated during cell proliferation. This sensor was used in combination with a redox-sensitive fluorescent protein to quantify redox potential and GSH concentration simultaneously in the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, by exchanging the fluorescent protein, we created a near-infrared, targetable and quantitative GSH sensor. Fluorescent sensors that are responsive only in a specific subcellular location have remained elusive. Now, a chemogenetic sensing platform has been developed to sense glutathione in a user-defined organelle of interest. These tools enable quantitative studies of subcellular glutathione homeostasis using visible or near-infrared wavelengths.

Title: 
Taming phosphorus mononitride

Phosphorus mononitride (PN) only has a fleeting existence on Earth, and molecular precursors for the release of this molecule under mild conditions in solution have remained elusive. Here we report the synthesis of an anthracene-based precursor—an anthracene moiety featuring an azidophosphine bridge across its central ring—that dissociates into dinitrogen, anthracene and P≡N in solution with a first-order half-life of roughly 30 min at room temperature. Heated under reduced pressure, this azidophosphine–anthracene precursor decomposes in an explosive fashion at around 42 °C, as demonstrated in a molecular-beam mass spectrometry study. The precursor is also shown to serve as a PN transfer reagent in the synthesis of an Fe–NP coordination complex, through ligand exchange with its Fe–N2 counterpart. The terminal N-bonded complex was found to be energetically preferred, compared to its P-bonded linkage isomer, owing to a significant covalent Fe–pnictogen bond character and an associated less unfavourable Pauli repulsion in the metal–ligand interaction. Precursors for the release of phosphorus mononitride in solution under mild conditions have remained elusive. Now, an explosive anthracene-stabilized azidophosphine has shown PN transfer reactivity in the synthesis of an Fe–NP complex. The PN ligand is N-bonded, as the Fe–N interaction shows significant covalent character and a less unfavourable Pauli repulsion than its Fe–P counterpart.

Tracing the incorporation of the “ninth sulfur” into the nitrogenase cofactor precursor with selenite and tellurite

Molybdenum nitrogenase catalyses the reduction of N2 to NH3 at its cofactor, an [(R-homocitrate)MoFe7S9C] cluster synthesized via the formation of a [Fe8S9C] L-cluster prior to the insertion of molybdenum and homocitrate. We have previously identified a [Fe8S8C] L*-cluster, which is homologous to the core structure of the L-cluster but lacks the ‘ninth sulfur’ in the belt region. However, direct evidence and mechanistic details of the L*- to L-cluster conversion upon ‘ninth sulfur’ insertion remain elusive. Here we trace the ‘ninth sulfur’ insertion using SeO32− and TeO32− as ‘labelled’ SO32−. Biochemical, electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray absorption spectroscopy/extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies suggest a role of the ‘ninth sulfur’ in cluster transfer during cofactor biosynthesis while revealing the incorporation of Se2−- and Te2−-like species into the L-cluster. Density functional theory calculations further point to a plausible mechanism involving in situ reduction of SO32− to S2−, thereby suggesting the utility of this reaction to label the catalytically important belt region for mechanistic investigations of nitrogenase. Located in the catalytically important belt region, the ‘ninth sulfur’ of the nitrogenase cofactor has now been shown to be inserted through coordination of sulfite by two cluster iron atoms at a vacant belt site. This is followed by in situ reduction of sulfite to sulfide, which enables the subsequent transfer and functionalization of the cofactor.

Title: 
Ribosomal synthesis and de novo discovery of bioactive foldamer peptides containing cyclic β-amino acids

Peptides that contain β-amino acids display stable secondary structures, such as helices and sheets, and are often referred to as foldamers. Cyclic β2,3-amino acids (cβAAs), such as 2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (2-ACHC), are strong helix/turn inducers due to their restricted conformations. Here we report the ribosomal synthesis of foldamer peptides that contain multiple, up to ten, consecutive cβAAs via genetic code reprogramming. We also report the de novo discovery of macrocyclic cβAA-containing peptides capable of binding to a protein target. As a demonstration, potent binders with low-to-subnanomolar KD values were identified for human factor XIIa (hFXIIa) and interferon-gamma receptor 1, from a library of their 1012 members. One of the anti-hFXIIa macrocyclic peptides that exhibited a high inhibitory activity and serum stability was co-crystallized with hFXIIa. The X-ray structure revealed that it adopts an antiparallel β-sheet structure induced by a (1S,2S)-2-ACHC residue via the formation of two γ-turns. This work demonstrates the potential of this platform to explore the previously inaccessible sequence space of cβAA-containing peptides. Cyclic β-amino acids can add useful properties to peptides, such as inducing turn structures or providing resistance to proteases. To harness these properties up to ten consecutive cyclic β-amino acids have now been ribosomally incorporated via genetic code reprogramming into a foldamer peptide library that has been screened for potent binders against a protein target, human factor XIIa.

Title: 
Stabilization of intermediate spin states in mixed-valent diiron dichalcogenide complexes

The electronic structure and ground spin states, S, observed for mixed-valent iron–sulfur dimers (FeII-FeIII) are typically determined by the Heisenberg exchange interaction, J, that couples the magnetic interaction of the two metal centres either ferromagnetically (J &gt; 0, S = 9/2) or antiferromagnetically (J &lt; 0, S = 1/2). In the case of antiferromagnetically coupled iron centres, stabilization of the high-spin S = 9/2 ground state is also feasible through a Heisenberg double-exchange interaction, B, which lifts the degeneracy of the Heisenberg spin states. This theorem also predicts intermediate spin states for mixed-valent dimers, but those have so far remained elusive. Herein, we describe the structural, electron paramagnetic resonance and Mössbauer spectroscopic, and magnetic characterization of a series of mixed-valent complexes featuring [Fe2Q2]+ (Q = S2–, Se2–, Te2–), where the Se and Te complexes favour S = 3/2 spin states. The incorporation of heavier chalcogenides in this series reveals a delicate balance of antiferromagnetic coupling, Heisenberg double-exchange and vibronic coupling. Despite extensive investigations of mixed-valence complexes, molecules with intermediate spin states have remained elusive. Now, selenium- and tellurium-bridged mixed-valent iron dimers have been prepared in which a balance of Heisenberg exchange and double-exchange coupling of the unpaired electron, combined with moderate vibronic contributions, stabilizes S = 3/2 ground spin states.

Enantioselective construction of remote tertiary carbon–fluorine bonds

The carbon–fluorine bond engenders distinctive physicochemical properties and significant changes to general reactivity. The development of catalytic, enantioselective methods to set stereocentres that contain a benzylic C–F bond is a rapidly evolving goal in synthetic chemistry. Although there have been notable advances that enable the construction of secondary stereocentres that contain both a C–F and a C–H bond on the same carbon, significantly fewer strategies are defined to access stereocentres that incorporate a tertiary C–F bond, especially those remote from pre-existing activating groups. Here we report a general method that establishes C–F tertiary benzylic stereocentres by forging a C–C bond via a Pd-catalysed enantioselective Heck reaction of acyclic alkenyl fluorides with arylboronic acids. This method provides a platform to rapidly incorporate significant functionality about the benzylic tertiary fluoride by virtue of the diversity of both reaction partners, as well as the ability to install the stereocentres remotely from pre-existing functional groups. Although methods exist to construct secondary stereocentres containing both a C–F and C–H bond, the ability to form a tertiary C–F bond, remote from pre-existing activating groups, remains challenging. Now, C–F tertiary, benzylic stereocentres have been constructed through a Pd-catalysed enantioselective Heck reaction of acyclic alkenyl fluorides with arylboronic acids.

A trivalent 4f complex with two bis-silylamide ligands displaying slow magnetic relaxation

The best-performing single-molecule magnets (SMMs) have historically relied on pseudoaxial ligands delocalized across several coordinated atoms. This coordination environment has been found to elicit strong magnetic anisotropy, but lanthanide-based SMMs with low coordination numbers have remained synthetically elusive species. Here we report a cationic 4f complex bearing only two bis-silylamide ligands, Yb(III)[{N(SiMePh2)2}2][Al{OC(CF3)3}4], which exhibits slow relaxation of its magnetization. The combination of the bulky silylamide ligands and weakly coordinating [Al{OC(CF3)3}4]− anion provides a sterically hindered environment that suitably stabilizes the pseudotrigonal geometry necessary to elicit strong ground-state magnetic anisotropy. The resolution of the mJ states by luminescence spectroscopy is supported by ab initio calculations, which show a large ground-state splitting of approximately 1,850 cm−1. These results provide a facile route to access a bis-silylamido Yb(III) complex, and further underline the desirability of axially coordinated ligands with well-localized charges for high-performing SMMs. A trivalent 4f cationic complex bearing two bis-silylamide ligands has been prepared that displays slow magnetic relaxation. The bulky ligands and weakly coordinating anion stabilize the pseudotrigonal geometry necessary to elicit strong ground-state magnetic anisotropy in this axially coordinated Yb(III) complex with well-localized charges.

Shortwave infrared polymethine fluorophores matched to excitation lasers enable non-invasive, multicolour in vivo imaging in real time

High-resolution, multiplexed experiments are a staple in cellular imaging. Analogous experiments in animals are challenging, however, due to substantial scattering and autofluorescence in tissue at visible (350–700 nm) and near-infrared (700–1,000 nm) wavelengths. Here, we enable real-time, non-invasive multicolour imaging experiments in animals through the design of optical contrast agents for the shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1,000–2,000 nm) region and complementary advances in imaging technologies. We developed tunable, SWIR-emissive flavylium polymethine dyes and established relationships between structure and photophysical properties for this class of bright SWIR contrast agents. In parallel, we designed an imaging system with variable near-infrared/SWIR excitation and single-channel detection, facilitating video-rate multicolour SWIR imaging for optically guided surgery and imaging of awake and moving mice with multiplexed detection. Optimized dyes matched to 980 nm and 1,064 nm lasers, combined with the clinically approved indocyanine green, enabled real-time, three-colour imaging with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Conducting high-resolution, multiplexed imaging in living mammals is challenging because of considerable scattering and autofluorescence in tissue at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Now, real-time, non-invasive multicolour imaging experiments in live animals have been achieved through the design of optical contrast agents for the shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1,000–2,000 nm) region and the introduction of excitation multiplexing with single-channel SWIR detection.

Substrate-driven chemotactic assembly in an enzyme cascade

Enzymatic catalysis is essential to cell survival. In many instances, enzymes that participate in reaction cascades have been shown to assemble into metabolons in response to the presence of the substrate for the first enzyme. However, what triggers metabolon formation has remained an open question. Through a combination of theory and experiments, we show that enzymes in a cascade can assemble via chemotaxis. We apply microfluidic and fluorescent spectroscopy techniques to study the coordinated movement of the first four enzymes of the glycolysis cascade: hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase and aldolase. We show that each enzyme independently follows its own specific substrate gradient, which in turn is produced by the preceding enzymatic reaction. Furthermore, we find that the chemotactic assembly of enzymes occurs even under cytosolic crowding conditions. Enzymes that form a metabolic pathway in which the product of one enzyme is the substrate for the next have now been shown to associate through a process of sequential, directed chemotactic movement. The extent of enzyme migration is proportional to the exposure time to the substrate gradient.

Mass spectrometry captures biased signalling and allosteric modulation of a G-protein-coupled receptor

G-protein-coupled receptors signal through cognate G proteins. Despite the widespread importance of these receptors, their regulatory mechanisms for G-protein selectivity are not fully understood. Here we present a native mass spectrometry-based approach to interrogate both biased signalling and allosteric modulation of the β1-adrenergic receptor in response to various ligands. By simultaneously capturing the effects of ligand binding and receptor coupling to different G proteins, we probed the relative importance of specific interactions with the receptor through systematic changes in 14 ligands, including isoprenaline derivatives, full and partial agonists, and antagonists. We observed enhanced dynamics of the intracellular loop 3 in the presence of isoprenaline, which is capable of acting as a biased agonist. We also show here that endogenous zinc ions augment the binding in receptor–Gs complexes and propose a zinc ion-binding hotspot at the TM5/TM6 intracellular interface of the receptor–Gs complex. Further interrogation led us to propose a mechanism in which zinc ions facilitate a structural transition of the intermediate complex towards the stable state. Native mass spectrometry has been used to interrogate both biased signalling and allosteric modulation of the β1-adrenergic receptor. Simultaneously capturing the effects of ligand binding and receptor coupling to different G proteins has enabled the relative importance of specific interactions to be investigated.

Genetically programmed cell-based synthesis of non-natural peptide and depsipeptide macrocycles

The direct genetically encoded cell-based synthesis of non-natural peptide and depsipeptide macrocycles is an outstanding challenge. Here we programme the encoded synthesis of 25 diverse non-natural macrocyclic peptides, each containing two non-canonical amino acids, in Syn61Δ3-derived cells; these cells contain a synthetic Escherichia coli genome in which the annotated occurrences of two sense codons and a stop codon, and the cognate transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and release factor that normally decode these codons, have been removed. We further demonstrate that pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs from distinct classes can be engineered to direct the co-translational incorporation of diverse alpha hydroxy acids, with both aliphatic and aromatic side chains. We define 49 engineered mutually orthogonal pairs that recognize distinct non-canonical amino acids or alpha hydroxy acids and decode distinct codons. Finally, we combine our advances to programme Syn61Δ3-derived cells for the encoded synthesis of 12 diverse non-natural depsipeptide macrocycles, which contain two non-canonical side chains and either one or two ester bonds. Macrocyclic peptides can be genetically encoded and synthesized in cells; however, the programmable diversity is limited. Now, macrocycles containing two non-canonical amino acids have been genetically encoded and synthesized in codon-reassigned Syn61Δ3 cells. Incorporating diverse hydroxy acids in Syn61Δ3 cells enables the synthesis of non-natural depsipeptides containing either one or two ester bonds.

Chemical-mediated translocation in protocell-based microactuators

Artificial cell-like communities participate in diverse modes of chemical interaction but exhibit minimal interfacing with their local environment. Here we develop an interactive microsystem based on the immobilization of a population of enzyme-active semipermeable proteinosomes within a helical hydrogel filament to implement signal-induced movement. We attach large single-polynucleotide/peptide microcapsules at one or both ends of the helical protocell filament to produce free-standing soft microactuators that sense and process chemical signals to perform mechanical work. Different modes of translocation are achieved by synergistic or antagonistic enzyme reactions located within the helical connector or inside the attached microcapsule loads. Mounting the microactuators on a ratchet-like surface produces a directional push–pull movement. Our methodology opens up a route to protocell-based chemical systems capable of utilizing mechanical work and provides a step towards the engineering of soft microscale objects with increased levels of operational autonomy. Although many systems that involve protocell–protocell interactions have been developed, there are fewer reports of protocell–environment interactive systems. Now, helical hydrogel filaments—in which enzyme-containing proteinosomes are immobilized—have been shown to contract and expand as the local chemical environment changes. Enzyme processing regulates the chemomechanical responses to generate different modes of actuation in the soft microstructures.

Palladium-catalysed selective oxidative amination of olefins with Lewis basic amines

Amines are prominent in natural products, pharmaceutical agents and agrochemicals. Moreover, they are synthetically valuable building blocks for the construction of complex organic molecules and functional materials. However, amines, especially aliphatic and aromatic amines with free N–H bonds, tend to coordinate with transition metals and deactivate the catalyst, posing a tremendous challenge to applying Lewis basic amines in the amination of olefins. Here we present an example of oxidative amination of simple olefins with various Lewis basic amines. The combination of a palladium catalyst, 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone and a phosphorous ligand leads to the efficient synthesis of alkyl and aryl allylamines. A series of allylamines were obtained with good yields and excellent regio- and stereoselectivities. Intramolecular amination to synthesize tetrahydropyrrole and piperidine derivatives was also realized. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction undergoes allylic C(sp3)–H activation and subsequent functionalization. Given the importance of amine compounds, methods for their synthesis continue to be in high demand. Now, a palladium-catalysed strategy has been developed for the selective oxidative amination of unactivated olefins with Lewis basic amines, via C(sp3)–H activation, forming architecturally versatile and functionally diverse allylamines in a single step.

Catalytic dehydrogenative decarboxyolefination of carboxylic acids

Alkenes are among the most versatile building blocks and are widely used for the production of polymers, detergents and synthetic lubricants. Currently, alkenes are sourced from petroleum feedstocks such as naphtha. In light of the necessity to invent sustainable production methods, multiple approaches to making alkenes from abundant fatty acids have been evaluated. However, all attempts so far have required at least one stoichiometric additive, which is an obstruction for applications at larger scales. Here, we report an approach to making olefins from carboxylic acids, in which every additional reaction constituent can be used as a catalyst. We show how abundant fatty acids can be converted to alpha-olefins, and expand the method to include structurally complex carboxylic acids, giving access to synthetically versatile intermediates. Our approach is enabled by the cooperative interplay between a cobalt catalyst, which functions as a proton reduction catalyst, and a photoredox catalyst, which mediates oxidative decarboxylation; coupling both processes enables catalytic conversion of carboxylic acids to olefins. A direct conversion of carboxylic acids to alpha-olefins without the need for a stoichiometric additive has now been reported. The transformation is enabled by a dual cobalt/iridium proton-reduction–photoredox catalyst system, and can proceed on abundant fatty acids as well as on complex carboxylic acids.

A fluorescent membrane tension probe

Cells and organelles are delimited by lipid bilayers in which high deformability is essential to many cell processes, including motility, endocytosis and cell division. Membrane tension is therefore a major regulator of the cell processes that remodel membranes, albeit one that is very hard to measure in vivo. Here we show that a planarizable push–pull fluorescent probe called FliptR (fluorescent lipid tension reporter) can monitor changes in membrane tension by changing its fluorescence lifetime as a function of the twist between its fluorescent groups. The fluorescence lifetime depends linearly on membrane tension within cells, enabling an easy quantification of membrane tension by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. We further show, using model membranes, that this linear dependency between lifetime of the probe and membrane tension relies on a membrane-tension-dependent lipid phase separation. We also provide calibration curves that enable accurate measurement of membrane tension using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Lipid membranes—which separate cells and organelles from their environment—experience tension during various cell processes; however, measuring membrane tension is notoriously difficult. Now, a new fluorescent, mechanosensitive membrane probe called FliptR has been developed. FliptR enables simple, direct membrane tension measurements in cellular and artificial membranes.

Towards high-performance sustainable polymers via isomerization-driven irreversible ring-opening polymerization of five-membered thionolactones

The development of sustainable polymers that possess useful material properties competitive with existing petroleum-derived polymers is a crucial goal but remains a formidable challenge for polymer science. Here we demonstrate that irreversible ring-opening polymerization (IROP) of biomass-derived five-membered thionolactones is an effective and robust strategy for the polymerization of non-strained five-membered rings—these polymerizations are commonly thermodynamically forbidden under ambient conditions, at industrially relevant temperatures of 80–100 °C. Computational studies reveal that the selective IROP of these thionolactones is thermodynamically driven by S/O isomerization during the ring-opening process. IROP of γ-thionobutyrolactone, a representative non-strained thionolactone, affords a sustainable polymer from renewable resources that possesses external-stimuli-triggered degradability. This poly(thiolactone) also exhibits high performance, with its key thermal and mechanical properties comparing well to those of commercial petroleum-based low-density polyethylene. This IROP strategy will enable conversion of five-membered lactones, generally unachievable by other polymerization methods, into sustainable polymers with a range of potential applications. Five-membered lactones are common in nature and are produced in large quantities from biomass, but a lack of ring strain means that ring-opening polymerization is usually thermodynamically unfavourable at ambient conditions. Now, an irreversible ring-opening polymerization of biomass-derived five-membered thionolactones—driven by S/O isomerization—has been developed, enabling their conversion into sustainable polymers at industrially relevant temperatures.

Time-dependent enantiodivergent synthesis via sequential kinetic resolution

The preparation of both enantiomers of chiral molecules is among the most fundamental tasks in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and materials science. Achieving this goal typically requires reversing the absolute configuration of the chiral component employed in the reaction system that is being used. The task becomes challenging when the natural source of the chiral component is not available in both configurations. Herein, we report a time-dependent enantiodivergent synthesis, in which an Ir-catalysed allylic substitution reaction uses one catalyst sequentially to promote two kinetic resolution reactions, enabling the synthesis of both enantiomers of the product using the same enantiomer of a chiral catalyst. The appropriate permutation of individual reaction rates is essential for the isolation of the chiral products in opposite configurations with high enantiopurity when quenched at different reaction times. This work provides an alternative solution for the preparation of both enantiomers of chiral molecules. Access to both enantiomers of a chiral target compound typically relies on reversing the absolute configuration of the chiral component in the reaction system that is used to make them. A time-dependent enantiodivergent synthesis is reported in which the same enantiomer of a chiral catalyst can give both enantiomers of the product, depending on the reaction time.

Practical and regioselective amination of arenes using alkyl amines

The formation of carbon–nitrogen bonds for the preparation of aromatic amines is among the top five reactions carried out globally for the production of high-value materials, ranging from from bulk chemicals to pharmaceuticals and polymers. As a result of this ubiquity and diversity, methods for their preparation impact the full spectrum of chemical syntheses in academia and industry. In general, these molecules are assembled through the stepwise introduction of a reactivity handle in place of an aromatic C–H bond (that is, a nitro group, halogen or boronic acid) and a subsequent functionalization or cross-coupling. Here we show that aromatic amines can be constructed by direct reaction of arenes and alkyl amines using photocatalysis, without the need for pre-functionalization. The process enables the easy preparation of advanced building blocks, tolerates a broad range of functionalities, and multigram scale can be achieved via a batch-to-flow protocol. The merit of this strategy as a late-stage functionalization platform has been demonstrated by the modification of several drugs, agrochemicals, peptides, chiral catalysts, polymers and organometallic complexes. The synthesis of aryl amines is traditionally achieved through aromatic nitration or transition metal-catalysed cross coupling. Now, photocatalysis provides a route for the direct and selective C–H amination of aromatics with alkyl amines, without the need for pre-functionalization. This reaction tolerates a variety of functional groups and can be used for late-stage modification.

Repurposing human kinase inhibitors to create an antibiotic active against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, persisters and biofilms

New drugs are desperately needed to combat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Here, we report screening commercial kinase inhibitors for antibacterial activity and found the anticancer drug sorafenib as major hit that effectively kills MRSA strains. Varying the key structural features led to the identification of a potent analogue, PK150, that showed antibacterial activity against several pathogenic strains at submicromolar concentrations. Furthermore, this antibiotic eliminated challenging persisters as well as established biofilms. PK150 holds promising therapeutic potential as it did not induce in vitro resistance, and shows oral bioavailability and in vivo efficacy. Analysis of the mode of action using chemical proteomics revealed several targets, which included interference with menaquinone biosynthesis by inhibiting demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase and the stimulation of protein secretion by altering the activity of signal peptidase IB. Reduced endogenous menaquinone levels along with enhanced levels of extracellular proteins of PK150-treated bacteria support this target hypothesis. The associated antibiotic effects, especially the lack of resistance development, probably stem from the compound’s polypharmacology. Screening commercial kinase inhibitors for antibacterial activity identified the anticancer drug sorafenib as a major hit. Subsequent structure–activity optimization created a new antibacterial analogue with high potency against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including challenging persisters and biofilms, as well as demonstrating efficacy in an in vivo mouse model. The mode of action involves stimulation of protein secretion and inhibition of menaquinone biosynthesis.

Observation of the adsorption and desorption of vibrationally excited molecules on a metal surface

The most common mechanism of catalytic surface chemistry is that of Langmuir and Hinshelwood (LH). In the LH mechanism, reactants adsorb, become thermalized with the surface, and subsequently react. The measured vibrational (relaxation) lifetimes of molecules adsorbed at metal surfaces are in the range of a few picoseconds. As a consequence, vibrational promotion of LH chemistry is rarely observed, with the exception of LH reactions occurring via a molecular physisorbed intermediate. Here, we directly detect adsorption and subsequent desorption of vibrationally excited CO molecules from a Au(111) surface. Our results show that CO (v = 1) survives on a Au(111) surface for ~1 × 10−10 s. Such long vibrational lifetimes for adsorbates on metal surfaces are unexpected and pose an interesting challenge to the current understanding of vibrational energy dissipation on metal surfaces. They also suggest that vibrational promotion of surface chemistry might be more common than is generally believed. The vibrational relaxation of molecules adsorbed at metal surfaces is considered to be relatively fast and thus examples of vibrationally induced chemistry at surfaces are rare. The adsorption and subsequent desorption of long-lived vibrationally excited CO molecules from a gold surface have now been observed, suggesting that vibrational promotion of surface chemistry might be more prevalent than currently thought.

Title: 
Indole-5,6-quinones display hallmark properties of eumelanin

Melanins are ubiquitous biopolymers produced from phenols and catechols by oxidation. They provide photoprotection, pigmentation and redox activity to most life forms, and inspire synthetic materials with desirable optical, electronic and mechanical properties. The chemical structures of melanins remain elusive, however, creating uncertainty about their roles, and preventing the design of synthetic mimics with tailored properties. Indole-5,6-quinone (IQ) has been implicated as a biosynthetic intermediate and structural subunit of mammalian eumelanin pigments, but its instability has prevented its isolation and unambiguous characterization. Here we use steric shielding to stabilize IQ and show that ‘blocked’ derivatives exhibit eumelanin’s characteristic ultrafast nonradiative decay and its ability to absorb light from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. These new compounds are also redox-active and a source of paramagnetism, emulating eumelanin’s unique electronic properties, which include persistent radicals. Blocked IQs are atomistically precise and tailorable molecules that can offer a bottom–up understanding of emergent properties in eumelanin and have the potential to advance the rational design of melanin-inspired materials. Indole-5,6-quinone (IQ) is a long-sought intermediate and structural subunit of eumelanin pigments whose instability has precluded isolation and characterization. It has now been shown that a sterically shielded derivative of IQ exhibits hallmark eumelanin properties, including near-infrared absorption, ultrafast nonradiative decay and a persistent semiquinone radical formed by comproportionation.

Charge transfer driven by ultrafast spin transition in a CoFe Prussian blue analogue

Photoinduced charge-transfer is an important process in nature and technology and is responsible for the emergence of exotic functionalities, such as magnetic order for cyanide-bridged bimetallic coordination networks. Despite its broad interest and intensive developments in chemistry and material sciences, the atomic-scale description of the initial photoinduced process, which couples intermetallic charge-transfer and spin transition, has been debated for decades; it has been beyond reach due to its extreme speed. Here we study this process in a prototype cyanide-bridged CoFe system by femtosecond X-ray and optical absorption spectroscopies, enabling the disentanglement of ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics. Our results demonstrate that it is the spin transition that occurs first on the Co site within ~50 fs, and it is this that drives the subsequent Fe-to-Co charge-transfer within ~200 fs. This study represents a step towards understanding and controlling charge-transfer-based functions using light. Cyanide-bridged CoFe coordination networks exhibit photomagnetism because of coupled charge-transfer and spin transition. Now, femtosecond X-ray and optical absorption spectroscopies have enabled the electronic and structural dynamics of this light-induced process to be disentangled and show that it is the spin transition on the cobalt atom, occurring within ~50 fs, that induces the Fe-to-Co charge-transfer within ~200 fs.

Title: 
Glycine-derived nitronates bifurcate to O-methylation or denitrification in bacteria

Natural products with rare functional groups are likely to be constructed by unique biosynthetic enzymes. One such rare functional group is the O-methyl nitronate, which can undergo [3 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with olefins in mild conditions. O-methyl nitronates are found in some natural products; however, how such O-methyl nitronates are assembled biosynthetically is unknown. Here we show that the assembly of the O-methyl nitronate in the natural product enteromycin carboxamide occurs via activation of glycine on a peptidyl carrier protein, followed by reaction with a diiron oxygenase to give a nitronate intermediate and then with a methyltransferase to give an O-methyl nitronate. Guided by the discovery of this pathway, we then identify related cryptic biosynthetic gene cassettes in other bacteria and show that these alternative gene cassettes can, instead, facilitate oxidative denitrification of glycine-derived nitronates. Altogether, our work reveals bifurcating pathways from a central glycine-derived nitronate intermediate in bacteria. O-methyl nitronate is a rare functional group in natural products. Now, the biosynthetic pathway to O-methyl nitronate, which involves O-methylation of a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-tethered nitronate, has been revealed. In some bacteria, the same PCP-tethered nitronate is shown to be oxidized by nitronate monooxygenases to provide nitrite and a PCP-tethered glyoxylate.

Sequence-defined multifunctional polyethers via liquid-phase synthesis with molecular sieving

Synthetic chemists have devoted tremendous effort towards the production of precision synthetic polymers with defined sequences and specific functions. However, the creation of a general technology that enables precise control over monomer sequence, with efficient isolation of the target polymers, is highly challenging. Here, we report a robust strategy for the production of sequence-defined synthetic polymers through a combination of liquid-phase synthesis and selective molecular sieving. The polymer is assembled in solution with real-time monitoring to ensure couplings proceed to completion, on a three-armed star-shaped macromolecule to maximize efficiency during the molecular sieving process. This approach is applied to the construction of sequence-defined polyethers, with side-arms at precisely defined locations that can undergo site-selective modification after polymerization. Using this versatile strategy, we have introduced structural and functional diversity into sequence-defined polyethers, unlocking their potential for real-life applications in nanotechnology, healthcare and information storage. The creation of a viable technology that enables precise control over the monomer sequence in synthetic polymers remains a significant challenge. High-purity sequence-defined polyethers with readily tailored side-chain functionalities have now been made through liquid-phase iterative synthesis combined with size-exclusion molecular sieving and real-time monitoring.

Title: 
On-water surface synthesis of crystalline, few-layer two-dimensional polymers assisted by surfactant monolayers

Despite rapid progress in recent years, it has remained challenging to prepare crystalline two-dimensional polymers. Here, we report the controlled synthesis of few-layer two-dimensional polyimide crystals on the surface of water through reaction between amine and anhydride monomers, assisted by surfactant monolayers. We obtained polymers with high crystallinity, thickness of ~2 nm and an average crystal domain size of ~3.5 μm2. The molecular structure of the materials, their grain boundaries and their edge structures were characterized using X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy techniques. These characterizations were supported by computations. The formation of crystalline polymers is attributed to the pre-organization of monomers at the water–surfactant interface. The surfactant, depending on its polar head, promoted the arrangement of the monomers—and in turn their polymerization—either horizontally or vertically with respect to the water surface. The latter was observed with a surfactant bearing a carboxylic acid group, which anchored amine monomers vertically through a condensation reaction. In both instances, micrometre-sized, few-layer two-dimensional polyamide crystals were grown. It is difficult to prepare 2D polymers that are crystalline over large areas. Now, few-layer 2D polyimides and polyamides with good crystallinity on the micrometre scale have been synthesized on a water surface. A surfactant monolayer is used to organize amine monomers before their polymerization with anhydride moieties.

Title: 
High phase-purity 1T′-MoS2- and 1T′-MoSe2-layered crystals

Phase control plays an important role in the precise synthesis of inorganic materials, as the phase structure has a profound influence on properties such as conductivity and chemical stability. Phase-controlled preparation has been challenging for the metallic-phase group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (the transition metals are Mo and W, and the chalcogens are S, Se and Te), which show better performance in electrocatalysis than their semiconducting counterparts. Here, we report the large-scale preparation of micrometre-sized metallic-phase 1T′-MoX2 (X = S, Se)-layered bulk crystals in high purity. We reveal that 1T′-MoS2 crystals feature a distorted octahedral coordination structure and are convertible to 2H-MoS2 following thermal annealing or laser irradiation. Electrochemical measurements show that the basal plane of 1T′-MoS2 is much more active than that of 2H-MoS2 for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction in an acidic medium. The phase in which a crystal exists can have a direct influence over its properties; however, it is usually difficult to control during synthesis. Now it has been shown that micrometre-sized metallic 1T′-MoS2- and 1T′-MoSe2-layered crystals can be prepared in high phase purity on a large scale, and that they display promising electrocatalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Genetically encoded chemical crosslinking of carbohydrate

Protein–carbohydrate interactions play important roles in various biological processes, such as organism development, cancer metastasis, pathogen infection and immune response, but they remain challenging to study and exploit due to their low binding affinity and non-covalent nature. Here we site-specifically engineered covalent linkages between proteins and carbohydrates under biocompatible conditions. We show that sulfonyl fluoride reacts with glycans via a proximity-enabled reactivity, and to harness this a bioreactive unnatural amino acid (SFY) that contains sulfonyl fluoride was genetically encoded into proteins. SFY-incorporated Siglec-7 crosslinked with its sialoglycan ligand specifically in vitro and on the surface of cancer cells. Through irreversible cloaking of sialoglycan at the cancer cell surface, SFY-incorporated Siglec-7 enhanced the killing of cancer cells by natural killer cells. Genetically encoding the chemical crosslinking of proteins to carbohydrates (GECX-sugar) offers a solution to address the low affinity and weak strength of protein–sugar interactions. Protein–carbohydrate interactions remain challenging to study due to their low binding affinity and non-covalent nature. Now, a genetically encoded bioreactive unnatural amino acid containing sulfonyl fluoride has been shown to crosslink a protein with its bound glycan, offering a solution to probe and exploit protein–carbohydrate interactions.

Parallel transmission in a synthetic nerve

Bioelectronic devices that are tetherless and soft are promising developments in medicine, robotics and chemical computing. Here, we describe bioinspired synthetic neurons, composed entirely of soft, flexible biomaterials, capable of rapid electrochemical signal transmission over centimetre distances. Like natural cells, our synthetic neurons release neurotransmitters from their terminals, which initiate downstream reactions. The components of the neurons are nanolitre aqueous droplets and hydrogel fibres, connected through lipid bilayers. Transmission is powered at these interfaces by light-driven proton pumps and mediated by ion-conducting protein pores. By bundling multiple neurons into a synthetic nerve, we have shown that distinct signals can propagate simultaneously along parallel axons, thereby transmitting spatiotemporal information. Synthetic nerves might play roles in next-generation implants, soft machines and computing devices. Soft bioelectronic devices have exciting potential applications in robotics, computing and medicine, but they are typically restricted by the requirement for tethers or stiff electrodes. Now, a synthetic nerve has been developed that is bioinspired, wireless and powered by light. By patterning functionalized lipid membrane compartments, information was directionally conveyed using electrochemical signals.

Metallacyclic actinide catalysts for dinitrogen conversion to ammonia and secondary amines

Chemists have spent over a hundred years trying to make ambient temperature/pressure catalytic systems that can convert atmospheric dinitrogen into ammonia or directly into amines. A handful of successful d-block metal catalysts have been developed in recent years, but even binding of dinitrogen to an f-block metal cation is extremely rare. Here we report f-block complexes that can catalyse the reduction and functionalization of molecular dinitrogen, including the catalytic conversion of molecular dinitrogen to a secondary silylamine. Simple bridging ligands assemble two actinide metal cations into narrow dinuclear metallacycles that can trap the diatom while electrons from an externally bound group 1 metal, and protons or silanes, are added, enabling dinitrogen to be functionalized with modest but catalytic yields of six equivalents of secondary silylamine per molecule at ambient temperature and pressure. Metallacycles formed from two large, under-coordinated actinide MIV cations and two rigid arene-bridged aryloxide ligands are capable of binding dinitrogen inside their cavity. These f-block complexes can catalyse the reduction and functionalization of dinitrogen as well as the catalytic conversion of molecular dinitrogen to a secondary silylamine.

Title: 
Janus-type emission from a cyclometalated iron(iii) complex

Although iron is a dream candidate to substitute noble metals in photoactive complexes, realization of emissive and photoactive iron compounds is demanding due to the fast deactivation of their charge-transfer states. Emissive iron compounds are scarce and dual emission has not been observed before. Here we report the FeIII complex [Fe(ImP)2][PF6] (HImP = 1,1′-(1,3-phenylene)bis(3-methyl-1-imidazol-2-ylidene)), showing a Janus-type dual emission from ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)- and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT)-dominated states. This behaviour is achieved by a ligand design that combines four N-heterocyclic carbenes with two cyclometalating aryl units. The low-lying π* levels of the cyclometalating units lead to energetically accessible MLCT states that cannot evolve into LMCT states. With a lifetime of 4.6 ns, the strongly reducing and oxidizing MLCT-dominated state can initiate electron transfer reactions, which could constitute a basis for future applications of iron in photoredox catalysis. Noble metals dominate the field of photosensitizers and luminophores. Now, an approach incorporating cyclometalating and carbene functions into FeIII complexes has been shown to enable dual emission from the opposing ligand-to-metal and metal-to-ligand charge-transfer states. The latter shows an exceptionally long lifetime of 4.6 ns and is quenched by oxygen and other quenchers.

Title: 
Tailored silyl ether monomers enable backbone-degradable polynorbornene-based linear, bottlebrush and star copolymers through ROMP

Ring-opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene-based (macro)monomers is a powerful approach for the synthesis of macromolecules with diverse compositions and complex architectures. Nevertheless, a fundamental limitation of polymers prepared by this strategy is their lack of facile degradability, limiting their utility in a range of applications. Here we describe a class of readily available bifunctional silyl ether-based cyclic olefins that copolymerize efficiently with norbornene-based (macro)monomers to provide copolymers with backbone degradability under mildly acidic aqueous conditions and degradation rates that can be tuned over several orders of magnitude, depending on the silyl ether substituents. These monomers can be used to manipulate the in vivo biodistribution and clearance rate of polyethylene glycol-based bottlebrush polymers, as well as to synthesize linear, bottlebrush and brush-arm star copolymers with degradable segments. We expect that this work will enable preparation of degradable polymers by ROMP for biomedical applications, responsive self-assembly and improved sustainability. Ring-opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene-based (macro)monomers produces macromolecules with diverse compositions and complex architectures that cannot be degraded easily. Now, it has been shown that a class of eight-membered cyclic bifunctional silyl ether-based monomers copolymerize efficiently with norbornene-based (macro)monomers, providing a range of copolymers with tunable degradability under mildly acidic aqueous conditions.

A multi-stage single photochrome system for controlled photoswitching responses

The ability of molecular photoswitches to convert on/off responses into large macroscale property change is fundamental to light-responsive materials. However, moving beyond simple binary responses necessitates the introduction of new elements that control the chemistry of the photoswitching process at the molecular scale. To achieve this goal, we designed, synthesized and developed a single photochrome, based on a modified donor–acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA), capable of independently addressing multiple molecular states. The multi-stage photoswitch enables complex switching phenomena. To demonstrate this, we show spatial control of the transformation of a three-stage photoswitch by tuning the population of intermediates along the multi-step reaction pathway of the DASAs without interfering with either the first or final stage. This allows for a photonic three-stage logic gate where the secondary wavelength solely negates the input of the primary wavelength. These results provide a new strategy to move beyond traditional on/off binary photochromic systems and enable the design of future molecular logic systems. Moving beyond binary responses in photoswitches necessitates the introduction of new elements along their switching pathway. Now, a modified donor–acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) capable of independently addressing multiple molecular states has been developed. This enables the transformation of a three-stage photoswitch to be controlled by regulating intermediates along the DASA reaction pathway.

Quintuply orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNAPyl pairs

Mutually orthogonal aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase/transfer RNA pairs provide a foundation for encoding non-canonical amino acids into proteins, and encoded non-canonical polymer and macrocycle synthesis. Here we discover quintuply orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/pyrrolysyl-tRNA (tRNAPyl) pairs. We discover empirical sequence identity thresholds for mutual orthogonality and use these for agglomerative clustering of PylRS and tRNAPyl sequences; this defines numerous sequence clusters, spanning five classes of PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs (the existing classes +N, A and B, and newly defined classes C and S). Most of the PylRS clusters belong to classes that were unexplored for orthogonal pair generation. By testing pairs from distinct clusters and classes, and pyrrolysyl-tRNAs with unusual structures, we resolve 80% of the pairwise specificities required to make quintuply orthogonal PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs; we control the remaining specificities by engineering and directed evolution. Overall, we create 924 mutually orthogonal PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs, 1,324 triply orthogonal pairs, 128 quadruply orthogonal pairs and 8 quintuply orthogonal pairs. These advances may provide a key foundation for encoded polymer synthesis. Mutually orthogonal aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase/transfer RNA pairs are required for genetically encoding non-canonical amino acids into proteins, as well as for the encoded cellular synthesis of polymers and macrocycles; however, the scalable discovery of such pairs is challenging. A quintuply orthogonal set of pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/pyrrolysyl-tRNA pairs has now been generated through tRNA screening, engineering and directed evolution.

Odd–even alternations in helical propensity of a homologous series of hydrocarbons

Odd and even homologues of some n-alkane-based systems are known to exhibit notably different trends in solid-state properties; a well-known illustration is the zigzag plot of their melting point versus chain length. Odd–even effects in the solid state often arise from intermolecular interactions that involve fully extended molecules. These effects have also been observed in less condensed phases, such as self-assembled monolayers; however, the origins of these effects in such systems can be difficult to determine. Here we combined NMR and computational analysis to show that all-syn contiguously methyl-substituted hydrocarbons, with chain lengths from C6 to C11, exhibit a dramatic odd–even effect in helical propensity. The even- and odd-numbered hydrocarbons populate regular and less-controlled helical conformations, respectively. This knowledge will guide the design of helical hydrocarbons as rigid scaffolds or as hydrophobic components in soft materials. Even- and odd-numbered homologues of some hydrocarbons are known to exhibit different trends in solid-state properties. Now, experimental and computational investigations on a homologous series of a stereochemically well-defined hydrocarbon have revealed an odd–even effect in conformational behaviour in solution that is caused by a single gauche interaction.

Atomistic dynamics of elimination and nucleophilic substitution disentangled for the F− + CH3CH2Cl reaction

Chemical reaction dynamics are studied to monitor and understand the concerted motion of several atoms while they rearrange from reactants to products. When the number of atoms involved increases, the number of pathways, transition states and product channels also increases and rapidly presents a challenge to experiment and theory. Here we disentangle the dynamics of the competition between bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base-induced elimination (E2) in the polyatomic reaction F− + CH3CH2Cl. We find quantitative agreement for the energy- and angle-differential reactive scattering cross-sections between ion-imaging experiments and quasi-classical trajectory simulations on a 21-dimensional potential energy hypersurface. The anti-E2 pathway is most important, but the SN2 pathway becomes more relevant as the collision energy is increased. In both cases the reaction is dominated by direct dynamics. Our study presents atomic-level dynamics of a major benchmark reaction in physical organic chemistry, thereby pushing the number of atoms for detailed reaction dynamics studies to a size that allows applications in many areas of complex chemical networks and environments. As the number of atoms involved in a reaction increases, so do the experimental and theoretical challenges faced when studying their dynamics. Now, using ion-imaging experiments and quasi-classical trajectory simulations, the dynamics of the polyatomic reaction F– + CH3CH2Cl have been studied and the competition between bimolecular nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination has been disentangled.

Enantioselective fullerene functionalization through stereochemical information transfer from a self-assembled cage

The regioselective functionalization of C60 remains challenging, while the enantioselective functionalization of C60 is difficult to explore due to the need for complex chiral tethers or arduous chromatography. Metal–organic cages have served as masks to effect the regioselective functionalization of C60. However, it is difficult to control the stereochemistry of the resulting fullerene adducts through this method. Here we report a means of defining up to six stereocentres on C60, achieving enantioselective fullerene functionalization. This method involves the use of a metal–organic cage built from a chiral formylpyridine. Fullerenes hosted within the cavity of the cage can be converted into a series of C60 adducts through chemo-, regio- and stereo-selective Diels–Alder reactions with the edges of the cage. The chiral formylpyridine ultimately dictates the stereochemistry of these chiral fullerene adducts without being incorporated into them. Such chiral fullerene adducts may become useful in devices requiring circularly polarized light manipulation. The enantioselective functionalization of C60 is highly challenging, typically requiring complex chiral tethers or demanding chromatography. Fullerenes have now been shown to undergo Diels–Alder reactions in a chemo-, regio- and enantio-selective fashion through confinement within an enantiopure metal–organic cage functionalized with a chiral formylpyridine group.

Fluorogenic d-amino acids enable real-time monitoring of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and high-throughput transpeptidation assays

Peptidoglycan is an essential cell wall component that maintains the morphology and viability of nearly all bacteria. Its biosynthesis requires periplasmic transpeptidation reactions, which construct peptide crosslinkages between polysaccharide chains to endow mechanical strength. However, tracking the transpeptidation reaction in vivo and in vitro is challenging, mainly due to the lack of efficient, biocompatible probes. Here, we report the design, synthesis and application of rotor-fluorogenic d-amino acids (RfDAAs), enabling real-time, continuous tracking of transpeptidation reactions. These probes allow peptidoglycan biosynthesis to be monitored in real time by visualizing transpeptidase reactions in live cells, as well as real-time activity assays of d,d- and l,d-transpeptidases and sortases in vitro. The unique ability of RfDAAs to become fluorescent when incorporated into peptidoglycan provides a powerful new tool to study peptidoglycan biosynthesis with high temporal resolution and prospectively enable high-throughput screening for inhibitors of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Biosynthesis of peptidoglycan requires carefully orchestrated transpeptidation reactions to maintain the structural integrity of this essential component of the bacterial cell wall. Now, rotor-fluorescent d-amino acids have been shown to enable real-time tracking of these transpeptidation reactions in live bacterial cells. These powerful tools allow visualization of peptidoglycan biosynthesis with high spatiotemporal resolution.

Accelerating proton-coupled electron transfer of metal hydrides in catalyst model reactions

Metal hydrides are key intermediates in catalytic proton reduction and dihydrogen oxidation. There is currently much interest in appending proton relays near the metal centre to accelerate catalysis by proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). However, the elementary PCET steps and the role of the proton relays are still poorly understood, and direct kinetic studies of these processes are scarce. Here, we report a series of tungsten hydride complexes as proxy catalysts, with covalently attached pyridyl groups as proton acceptors. The rate of their PCET reaction with external oxidants is increased by several orders of magnitude compared to that of the analogous systems with external pyridine on account of facilitated proton transfer. Moreover, the mechanism of the PCET reaction is altered by the appended bases. A unique feature is that the reaction can be tuned to follow three distinct PCET mechanisms—electron-first, proton-first or a concerted reaction—with very different sensitivities to oxidant and base strength. Such knowledge is crucial for rational improvements of solar fuel catalysts. A series of tungsten hydride complexes have been synthesized to mimic a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step undergone by metal–hydride intermediates during solar fuel catalysis. It is shown that, by incorporating proton-accepting bases into the second coordination sphere, their PCET oxidation mechanism changes and its rate increases by several orders of magnitude.

Kinetic modulation of graphene growth by fluorine through spatially confined decomposition of metal fluorides

Two-dimensional materials show a variety of promising properties, and controlling their growth is an important aspect for practical applications. To this end, active species such as hydrogen and oxygen are commonly introduced into reactors to promote the synthesis of two-dimensional materials with specific characteristics. Here, we demonstrate that fluorine can play a crucial role in tuning the growth kinetics of three representative two-dimensional materials (graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and WS2). When growing graphene by chemical vapour deposition on a copper foil, fluorine released from the decomposition of a metal fluoride placed near the copper foil greatly accelerates the growth of the graphene (up to a rate of ~200 μm s−1). Theoretical calculations show that it does so by promoting decomposition of the methane feedstock, which converts the endothermic growth process to an exothermic one. We further show that the presence of fluorine also accelerates the growth of two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride and WS2. Active species such as hydrogen and oxygen are commonly introduced into reactors to control the growth of two-dimensional materials. Now, the presence of fluorine—released by the decomposition of a metal fluoride sheet—has also been shown to modulate the growth kinetics of graphene, h-BN and WS2.

Constructing ion channels from water-soluble α-helical barrels

The design of peptides that assemble in membranes to form functional ion channels is challenging. Specifically, hydrophobic interactions must be designed between the peptides and at the peptide–lipid interfaces simultaneously. Here, we take a multi-step approach towards this problem. First, we use rational de novo design to generate water-soluble α-helical barrels with polar interiors, and confirm their structures using high-resolution X-ray crystallography. These α-helical barrels have water-filled lumens like those of transmembrane channels. Next, we modify the sequences to facilitate their insertion into lipid bilayers. Single-channel electrical recordings and fluorescent imaging of the peptides in membranes show monodisperse, cation-selective channels of unitary conductance. Surprisingly, however, an X-ray structure solved from the lipidic cubic phase for one peptide reveals an alternative state with tightly packed helices and a constricted channel. To reconcile these observations, we perform computational analyses to compare the properties of possible different states of the peptide. The de novo design of functional membrane proteins is a formidable challenge. Now, water-soluble peptides have been designed that assemble into α-helical barrels with accessible, polar and hydrated central channels. Insights from these structures have been used to produce stable membrane-spanning, cation-selective channels.

Enrichment-triggered prodrug activation demonstrated through mitochondria-targeted delivery of doxorubicin and carbon monoxide

Controlled activation is a critical component in prodrug development. Here we report a concentration-sensitive platform approach for bioorthogonal prodrug activation by taking advantage of reaction kinetics. Using two ‘click and release’ systems, we demonstrate enrichment and prodrug activation specifically in mitochondria to demonstrate the principle of the approach. In both cases, the payload (doxorubicin or carbon monoxide) was released inside the mitochondrial matrix following the enrichment-initiated click reaction. Furthermore, mitochondria-targeted delivery yielded substantial augmentation of functional biological and therapeutic effects in vitro and in vivo when compared to controls, which did not result in enrichment. This method is thus a platform for targeted drug delivery that is amenable to conjugation with a variety of molecules and is not limited to cell-surface delivery. Taken together, these two 'click and release' pairs clearly demonstrate the concept of enrichment-triggered drug release and the critical feasibility of treating clinically relevant diseases such as acute liver injury and cancer. A new concept for targeted drug delivery based on enrichment triggered prodrug activation has been developed. Without enrichment, the activation reaction is sluggish; however, following enrichment, the increased concentration enhances the activation reaction rate, thereby leading to the release of the payload. The same approach can be used in antibody–drug conjugate applications.

Title: 
Quantum–classical simulations of rhodopsin reveal excited-state population splitting and its effects on quantum efficiency

The activation of rhodopsin, the light-sensitive G-protein-coupled receptor responsible for dim-light vision in vertebrates, is driven by an ultrafast excited-state double-bond isomerization with a quantum efficiency of almost 70%. The origin of such light sensitivity is not understood and a key question is whether in-phase nuclear motion controls the quantum efficiency value. In this study we used hundreds of quantum–classical trajectories to show that, 15 fs after light absorption, a degeneracy between the reactive excited state and a neighbouring state causes the splitting of the rhodopsin population into subpopulations. These subpopulations propagate with different velocities and lead to distinct contributions to the quantum efficiency. We also show here that such splitting is modulated by protein electrostatics, thus linking amino acid sequence variations to quantum efficiency modulation. Finally, we discuss how such a linkage that in principle could be exploited to achieve higher quantum efficiencies would simultaneously increase the receptor thermal noise leading to a trade-off that may have played a role in rhodopsin evolution. Rhodopsin activation is driven by an ultrafast double-bond isomerization, but questions remain about the origin of its sensitivity. Now, quantum–classical simulations show that, 15 fs after light absorption, a degeneracy between the reactive excited state and a neighbouring state causes the splitting of the rhodopsin population into subpopulations, which propagate with different velocities, leading to distinct contributions to the quantum efficiency.

Inhibiting amyloid-β cytotoxicity through its interaction with the cell surface receptor LilrB2 by structure-based design

Inhibiting the interaction between amyloid-β (Aβ) and a neuronal cell surface receptor, LilrB2, has been suggested as a potential route for treating Alzheimer’s disease. Supporting this approach, Alzheimer’s-like symptoms are reduced in mouse models following genetic depletion of the LilrB2 homologue. In its pathogenic, oligomeric state, Aβ binds to LilrB2, triggering a pathway to synaptic loss. Here we identify the LilrB2 binding moieties of Aβ (16KLVFFA21) and identify its binding site on LilrB2 from a crystal structure of LilrB2 immunoglobulin domains D1D2 complexed to small molecules that mimic phenylalanine residues. In this structure, we observed two pockets that can accommodate the phenylalanine side chains of KLVFFA. These pockets were confirmed to be 16KLVFFA21 binding sites by mutagenesis. Rosetta docking revealed a plausible geometry for the Aβ–LilrB2 complex and assisted with the structure-guided selection of small molecule inhibitors. These molecules inhibit Aβ–LilrB2 interactions in vitro and on the cell surface and reduce Aβ cytotoxicity, which suggests these inhibitors are potential therapeutic leads against Alzheimer’s disease. Inhibiting the interaction between amyloid-β (Aβ) and a neuronal cell surface receptor, LilrB2, could offer a potential route for treating Alzheimer’s disease. Now, binding sites between Aβ and LilrB2 have been discovered and computational selection has identified inhibitors that block this binding site. Cell-penetrating inhibitors were found to block the Aβ–LilrB2 interaction and limit Aβ-induced cytotoxicity.

Observation of the asphericity of 4f-electron density and its relation to the magnetic anisotropy axis in single-molecule magnets

The distribution of electrons in the 4f orbitals of lanthanide ions is often assigned a crucial role in the design of single-molecule magnets, which maintain magnetization in zero external field. Optimal spatial complementarity between the 4f-electron density and the ligand field is key to maximizing magnetic anisotropy, which is an important factor in the ability of lanthanide complexes to display single-molecule magnet behaviour. Here we have experimentally determined the electron density distribution in two dysprosium molecular complexes by interpreting high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction with a multipole model. The ground-state 4f-electron density is found to be an oblate ellipsoid, as is often deduced from a simplified Sievers model that assumes a pure |±15/2&gt; ground-state doublet for the lanthanide ion. The large equatorial asymmetry—determined by a model wavefunction—was found to contain considerable MJ mixing of |±11/2&gt; and only 81% of |±15/2&gt;. The experimental molecular magnetic easy axes were recovered, and found to deviate by 13.1° and 8.7° from those obtained by ab initio calculations. Gaining a better understanding of the complex electronic structure of single-molecule magnets is essential for their design and development. The 4f-electron density distribution of a dysprosium single-molecule magnet has now been experimentally determined using synchrotron diffraction data interpreted with a multipole model. The magnetic easy axes were recovered by analysis of the 4f-electron density shape, which is clearly oblate.

Scalable and selective deuteration of (hetero)arenes

Isotope labelling, particularly deuteration, is an important tool for the development of new drugs, specifically for identification and quantification of metabolites. For this purpose, many efficient methodologies have been developed that allow for the small-scale synthesis of selectively deuterated compounds. Due to the development of deuterated compounds as active drug ingredients, there is a growing interest in scalable methods for deuteration. The development of methodologies for large-scale deuterium labelling in industrial settings requires technologies that are reliable, robust and scalable. Here we show that a nanostructured iron catalyst, prepared by combining cellulose with abundant iron salts, permits the selective deuteration of (hetero)arenes including anilines, phenols, indoles and other heterocycles, using inexpensive D2O under hydrogen pressure. This methodology represents an easily scalable deuteration (demonstrated by the synthesis of deuterium-containing products on the kilogram scale) and the air- and water-stable catalyst enables efficient labelling in a straightforward manner with high quality control. A method for the selective deuteration of anilines, indoles, phenols and heterocyclic compounds, including natural products and other bioactive molecules, has been developed. The nanostructured iron catalyst that underpins this process is prepared by combining cellulose with iron salts and has been used for the preparation of deuterated compounds on up to a kilogram scale.

Title: 
Post-translational formation of strained cyclophanes in bacteria

Cyclic peptide natural products have served as important drug molecules, with several examples used clinically. Enzymatic or chemical macrocyclization is the key transformation for constructing these chemotypes. Methods to generate new and diverse cyclic peptide scaffolds enabling the modular and predictable synthesis of peptide libraries are desirable in drug discovery platforms. Here we identify a suite of post-translational modifying enzymes from bacteria that install single or multiple strained cyclophane macrocycles. The crosslinking occurs on three-residue motifs that include tryptophan or phenylalanine to form indole- or phenyl-bridged cyclophanes. The macrocycles display restricted rotation of the aromatic ring and induce planar chirality in the asymmetric indole bridge. The biosynthetic gene clusters originate from a broad range of bacteria derived from marine, terrestrial and human microbiomes. Three-residue cyclophane-forming enzymes define a new and significant natural product family and occupy a distinct region in sequence–function space. A series of enzymes that catalyse the formation of strained peptide cyclophanes through a stereospecific C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond have been identified. Crosslinking occurs on three-residue motifs that include tryptophan or phenylalanine to form indole- or phenyl-bridged cyclophanes. These enzymes are widely distributed in nature and represent promising tools for peptide biotechnology.

Title: 
Silylated silicon–carbonyl complexes as mimics of ubiquitous transition-metal carbonyls

Transition-metal–carbonyl complexes are common organometallic reagents that feature metal–CO bonds. These complexes have proven to be powerful catalysts for various applications. By contrast, silicon–carbonyl complexes, organosilicon reagents poised to be eco-friendly alternatives for transition-metal carbonyls, have remained largely elusive. They have mostly been explored theoretically and/or through low-temperature matrix isolation studies, but their instability had typically precluded isolation under ambient conditions. Here we present the synthesis, isolation and full characterization of stable silyl-substituted silicon–carbonyl complexes, along with bonding analysis. Initial reactivity investigations showed examples of CO liberation, which could be induced either thermally or photochemically, as well as substitution and functionalization of the CO moiety. Importantly, the complexes exhibit strong Si–CO bonding, with CO→Si σ-donation and Si→CO π-backbonding, which is reminiscent of transition-metal carbonyls. This similarity between the abundant semi-metal silicon and rare transition metals may provide new opportunities for the development of silicon-based catalysis. Silyl-substituted silicon–carbonyl complexes that are stable at room temperature have been prepared by exposure of highly reactive bis(silyl)silylenes to carbon monoxide. The compounds show structural features and reactivity that are reminiscent of their ubiquitous transition-metal–carbonyl counterparts, including π-backbonding and ligand liberation as well as substitution and functionalization reactions.

Title: 
De novo design and engineering of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases

Peptides derived from non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) represent an important class of pharmaceutically relevant drugs. Methods to generate novel non-ribosomal peptides or to modify peptide natural products in an easy and predictable way are therefore of great interest. However, although the overall modular structure of NRPSs suggests the possibility of adjusting domain specificity and selectivity, only a few examples have been reported and these usually show a severe drop in production titre. Here we report a new strategy for the modification of NRPSs that uses defined exchange units (XUs) and not modules as functional units. XUs are fused at specific positions that connect the condensation and adenylation domains and respect the original specificity of the downstream module to enable the production of the desired peptides. We also present the use of internal condensation domains as an alternative to other peptide-chain-releasing domains for the production of cyclic peptides. Peptides derived from non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are an important class of pharmaceutically relevant drugs. However, no general rules for the modification of NRPS or the generation of artificial NRPS are known. Now, a new strategy for the modification of NRPS has been developed that uses defined exchange units that are fused at specific positions connecting the condensation and adenylation domains.

Title: 
A dual cellular–heterogeneous catalyst strategy for the production of olefins from glucose

Living systems provide a promising approach to chemical synthesis, having been optimized by evolution to convert renewable carbon sources, such as glucose, into an enormous range of small molecules. However, a large number of synthetic structures can still be difficult to obtain solely from cells, such as unsubstituted hydrocarbons. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a dual cellular–heterogeneous catalytic strategy to produce olefins from glucose using a selective hydrolase to generate an activated intermediate that is readily deoxygenated. Using a new family of iterative thiolase enzymes, we genetically engineered a microbial strain that produces 4.3 ± 0.4 g l−1 of fatty acid from glucose with 86% captured as 3-hydroxyoctanoic and 3-hydroxydecanoic acids. This 3-hydroxy substituent serves as a leaving group that enables heterogeneous tandem decarboxylation–dehydration routes to olefinic products on Lewis acidic catalysts without the additional redox input required for enzymatic or chemical deoxygenation of simple fatty acids. A dual cellular-then-heterogeneous catalysis strategy has been used to produce olefins from glucose. 3-Hydroxy acids are made using an engineered microbial host. A hydrolytic step then provides the driving force for fatty acid deoxygenation by simple heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysis. This decarboxylation–dehydration route to olefinic products avoids the need for an additional redox input typically required for deoxygenation of unmodified fatty acids.

Mechanochemical bond scission for the activation of drugs

Pharmaceutical drug therapy is often hindered by issues caused by poor drug selectivity, including unwanted side effects and drug resistance. Spatial and temporal control over drug activation in response to stimuli is a promising strategy to attenuate and circumvent these problems. Here we use ultrasound to activate drugs from inactive macromolecules or nano-assemblies through the controlled scission of mechanochemically labile covalent bonds and weak non-covalent bonds. We show that a polymer with a disulfide motif at the centre of the main chain releases an alkaloid-based anticancer drug from its β-carbonate linker by a force-induced intramolecular 5-exo-trig cyclization. Second, aminoglycoside antibiotics complexed by a multi-aptamer RNA structure are activated by the mechanochemical opening and scission of the nucleic acid backbone. Lastly, nanoparticle–polymer and nanoparticle–nanoparticle assemblies held together by hydrogen bonds between the peptide antibiotic vancomycin and its complementary peptide target are activated by force-induced scission of hydrogen bonds. This work demonstrates the potential of ultrasound to activate mechanoresponsive prodrug systems. Stimuli-responsive control of drug activation can mitigate issues caused by poor drug selectivity. Now, it has been shown that mechanical force—induced by ultrasound—can be used to activate drugs in three different systems. This approach has enabled the activation of antibiotics or a cytotoxic anticancer agent from synthetic polymers, polyaptamers and nanoparticle assemblies.

Title: 
Observation of correlated excitations in bimolecular collisions

Although collisions between atoms and molecules are largely understood, collisions between two molecules have proven much harder to study. In both experiment and theory, our ability to determine quantum-state-resolved bimolecular cross-sections lags behind their atom–molecule counterparts by decades. For many bimolecular systems, even rules of thumb—much less intuitive understanding—of scattering cross sections are lacking. Here, we report the measurement of state-to-state differential cross sections on the collision of state-selected and velocity-controlled nitric oxide (NO) radicals and oxygen (O2) molecules. Using velocity map imaging of the scattered NO radicals, the full product-pair correlations of rotational excitation that occurs in both collision partners from individual encounters are revealed. The correlated cross sections show surprisingly good agreement with quantum scattering calculations using ab initio NO−O2 potential energy surfaces. The observations show that the well-known energy-gap law that governs atom–molecule collisions does not generally apply to bimolecular excitation processes, and reveal a propensity rule for the vector correlation of product angular momenta. Collisions between atoms and molecules are largely understood; however, our understanding of collisions between two molecules is lacking because they are significantly harder to study, Now, correlated rotational excitations have been observed in inelastic collisions between NO and O2 molecules. It is shown that the energy-gap law that governs atom–molecule collisions does not generally apply to bimolecular excitation processes.

Title: 
Inverse kinetic isotope effects in the oxygen reduction reaction at platinum single crystals

Although the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) involves multiple proton-coupled electron transfer processes, early studies reported the absence of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on polycrystalline platinum, probably due to the use of unpurified D2O. Here we developed a methodology to prepare ultra-pure D2O, which is indispensable for reliably investigating extremely surface-sensitive platinum single crystals. We find that Pt(111) exhibits much higher ORR activity in D2O than in H2O, with potential-dependent inverse KIEs of ~0.5, whereas Pt(100) and Pt(110) exhibit potential-independent inverse KIEs of ~0.8. Such inverse KIEs are closely correlated to the lower *OD coverage and weakened *OD binding strength relative to *OH, which, based on theoretical calculations, are attributed to the differences in their zero-point energies. This study suggests that the competing adsorption between *OH/*OD and *O2 probably plays an important role in the ORR rate-determining steps that involve a chemical step preceding an electrochemical step (CE mechanism). Kinetic isotope effect studies can provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms of the oxygen reduction reaction; however, inaccessibility to ultra-high-purity D2O has made this difficult. Now, a methodology to prepare ultra-pure D2O has been developed and inverse kinetic isotope effects have subsequently been measured for the oxygen reduction reaction on platinum single-crystal surfaces, providing mechanistic insights.

Title: 
Arenes participate in 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with in situ-generated diazoalkenes

The venerable 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition has been widely used in organic synthesis for the construction of various heterocycles. However, in its century-long history, the simple and omnipresent aromatic phenyl ring has remained a stubbornly unreactive dipolarophile. Here we report 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between aromatic groups and diazoalkenes, generated in situ from lithium acetylides and N-sulfonyl azides. The reaction results in densely functionalized annulated cyclic sulfonamide-indazoles that can be further converted into stable organic molecules that are important in organic synthesis. The involvement of aromatic groups in the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions broadens the synthetic utility of diazoalkenes, a family of dipoles that have been little explored so far and are otherwise difficult to access. The process described here provides a route for the synthesis of medicinally relevant heterocycles and can be extended to other arene-containing starting materials. Computational examination of the proposed reaction pathway revealed a series of finely orchestrated bond-breaking and bond-forming events that ultimately lead to the annulated products. 1,3-Dipolar cycloadditions are well-known transformations in organic synthesis. However, the reactivity of benzene rings in these processes is underexplored. In situ-generated diazoalkenes have now been shown to undergo intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions with aromatic rings. The transformation results in an unaromatized benzene ring that enables the synthesis of functionalized heterocycles.

Excited-state intermediates in a designer protein encoding a phototrigger caught by an X-ray free-electron laser

One of the primary objectives in chemistry research is to observe atomic motions during reactions in real time. Although X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have facilitated the capture of reaction intermediates using time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX), only a few natural photoactive proteins have been investigated using this method, mostly due to the lack of suitable phototriggers. Here we report the genetic encoding of a xanthone amino acid (FXO), as an efficient phototrigger, into a rationally designed human liver fatty-acid binding protein mutant (termed XOM), which undergoes photo-induced C–H bond transformation with high selectivity and quantum efficiency. We solved the structures of XOM before and 10–300 ns after flash illumination, at 1.55–1.70 Å resolutions, and captured the elusive excited-state intermediates responsible for precise C–H bond activation. We expect that most redox enzymes can now be investigated by TR-SFX, using our method, to reveal reaction intermediates key for their efficiency and selectivity. A genetically encoded phototrigger based on a xanthone amino acid can expand the scope of time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography beyond naturally photoactive proteins. This approach has been used to uncover metastable reaction intermediates that occur prior to C–H bond activation in a human liver fatty-acid-binding protein mutant.

Title: 
Dual electrocatalysis enables enantioselective hydrocyanation of conjugated alkenes

Chiral nitriles and their derivatives are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. Enantioselective alkene hydrocyanation represents a convenient and efficient approach for synthesizing these molecules. However, a generally applicable method featuring a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance remains elusive. Here, we address this long-standing synthetic problem using dual electrocatalysis. Using this strategy, we leverage electrochemistry to seamlessly combine two canonical radical reactions—cobalt-mediated hydrogen-atom transfer and copper-promoted radical cyanation—to accomplish highly enantioselective hydrocyanation without the need for stoichiometric oxidants. We also harness electrochemistry’s unique feature of precise potential control to optimize the chemoselectivity of challenging substrates. Computational analysis uncovers the origin of enantio-induction, for which the chiral catalyst imparts a combination of attractive and repulsive non-covalent interactions to direct the enantio-determining C–CN bond formation. This work demonstrates the power of electrochemistry in accessing new chemical space and providing solutions to pertinent challenges in synthetic chemistry. A general method for the enantioselective hydrocyanation of alkenes has been a long-standing synthetic challenge. Now, using a dual electrocatalytic approach that combines two synergistic redox catalytic cycles, a wide variety of chiral nitriles can be synthesized from conjugated alkenes in high enantioselectivity.

Title: 
Selective visible-light photocatalysis of acetylene to ethylene using a cobalt molecular catalyst and water as a proton source

The production of polymers from ethylene requires the ethylene feed to be sufficiently purified of acetylene contaminant. Accomplishing this task by thermally hydrogenating acetylene requires a high temperature, an external feed of H2 gas and noble-metal catalysts. It is not only expensive and energy-intensive, but also prone to overhydrogenating to ethane. Here we report a photocatalytic system that reduces acetylene to ethylene with ≥99% selectivity under both non-competitive (no ethylene co-feed) and competitive (ethylene co-feed) conditions, and near 100% conversion under the latter industrially relevant conditions. Our system uses a molecular catalyst based on earth-abundant cobalt operating under ambient conditions and sensitized by either [Ru(bpy)3]2+ or an inexpensive organic semiconductor (metal-free mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride) under visible light. These features and the use of water as a proton source offer advantages over current hydrogenation technologies with respect to selectivity and sustainability. The acetylene contaminant present in ethylene feeds used to produce polymers is typically removed by thermal hydrogenation. Now, it has been shown that the conversion of acetylene to ethylene at room temperature can be achieved in a visible-light-driven process using an earth-abundant metal (cobalt) catalyst and a water proton source.

Title: 
A biologically stable DNAzyme that efficiently silences gene expression in cells

Efforts to use RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes (DNAzymes) as gene-silencing agents in therapeutic applications have stalled due to their low efficacy in clinical trials. Here we report a xeno-nucleic-acid-modified version of the classic DNAzyme 10–23 that achieves multiple-turnover activity under cellular conditions and resists nuclease digestion. The new reagent, X10–23, overcomes the problem of product inhibition, which limited previous 10–23 designs, using molecular chemotypes with DNA, 2′-fluoroarabino nucleic acid and α-l-threofuranosyl nucleic acid backbone architectures that balance the effects of enhanced biological stability with RNA hybridization and divalent metal ion coordination. In cultured mammalian cells, X10–23 facilitates persistent gene silencing by efficiently degrading exogenous and endogenous messenger RNA transcripts. Together, these results demonstrate that new molecular chemotypes can improve the activity and stability of DNAzymes, and may provide a new route for nucleic acid enzymes to reach the clinic. RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes (DNAzymes) have the potential to function as therapeutic agents by silencing the expression of disease-associated proteins. Xeno-nucleic acids were used to improve the catalytic activity and biological stability of a highly evolved DNAzyme known as 10–23. The enzyme exhibits a robust multiple-turnover activity in cultured mammalian cells.

Enzyme-powered motility in buoyant organoclay/DNA protocells

Reconstitution and simulation of cellular motility in microcompartmentalized colloidal objects have important implications for microcapsule-based remote sensing, environmentally induced signalling between artificial cell-like entities and programming spatial migration in synthetic protocell consortia. Here we describe the design and construction of catalase-containing organoclay/DNA semipermeable microcapsules, which in the presence of hydrogen peroxide exhibit enzyme-powered oxygen gas bubble-dependent buoyancy. We determine the optimum conditions for single and/or multiple bubble generation per microcapsule, monitor the protocell velocities and resilience, and use remote magnetic guidance to establish reversible changes in the buoyancy. Co-encapsulation of catalase and glucose oxidase is exploited to establish a spatiotemporal response to antagonistic bubble generation and depletion to produce protocells capable of sustained oscillatory vertical movement. We demonstrate that the motility of the microcapsules can be used for the flotation of macroscopic objects, self-sorting of mixed protocell communities and the delivery of a biocatalyst from an inert to chemically active environment. These results highlight new opportunities to constructing programmable microcompartmentalized colloids with buoyancy-derived motility. Organoclay/DNA semipermeable microcapsules with catalase-powered oxygen gas bubble-dependent buoyancy are prepared and exploited as synthetic protocells capable of programmed motility and sustained oscillatory movement.

Highly responsive nature of porous coordination polymer surfaces imaged by in situ atomic force microscopy

The ability of porous coordination polymers to undergo reversible structural transformations in response to the presence of guest molecules has been intensively investigated for applications such as molecular separation, storage, sensing and signalling processes. Here we report on the direct observation of the highly guest-responsive nature of the surface of a single-crystalline porous coordination polymer, which consists of paddlewheel zinc clusters and two types of ligand, by in situ liquid-phase atomic force microscopy. Observations were carried out in solution at constant temperature (28 °C) by high-speed atomic force microscopy with lattice resolution. A sharp and reversible response to the presence or absence of biphenyl guest molecules was observed, under conditions that can scarcely induce the transformation of the bulk crystal. Additionally, by modulating the surface coordination equilibrium, layer-by-layer delamination events were captured in real time at every ~13 s per frame. Some porous coordination polymers (PCPs) are known to be flexible and guest-responsive. Now, the guest-induced sharp, reversible structural transformation of the surface of a single-crystalline PCP has been visualized by in situ liquid-phase atomic force microscopy. This local response occurred at a guest concentration that was too low to trigger changes to the bulk crystal.

Title: 
A directive Ni catalyst overrides conventional site selectivity in pyridine C–H alkenylation

Achieving the transition metal-catalysed pyridine C3−H alkenylation, with pyridine as the limiting reagent, has remained a long-standing challenge. Previously, we disclosed that the use of strong coordinating bidentate ligands can overcome catalyst deactivation and provide Pd-catalysed C3 alkenylation of pyridines. However, this strategy proved ineffective when using pyridine as the limiting reagent, as it required large excesses and high concentrations to achieve reasonable yields, which rendered it inapplicable to complex pyridines prevalent in bioactive molecules. Here we report that a bifunctional N-heterocyclic carbene-ligated Ni–Al catalyst can smoothly furnish C3–H alkenylation of pyridines. This method overrides the intrinsic C2 and/or C4 selectivity, and provides a series of C3-alkenylated pyridines in 43–99% yields and up to 98:2 C3 selectivity. This method not only allows a variety of pyridine and heteroarene substrates to be used as the limiting reagent, but is also effective for the late-stage C3 alkenylation of diverse complex pyridine motifs in bioactive molecules. Selective C–H alkenylation of pyridines at the C3 position, with the pyridine as the limiting reagent, is a long-standing synthetic challenge. Now, it has been shown that this can be achieved using a bifunctional N-heterocyclic carbene-ligated Ni–Al catalyst that overrides the intrinsic C2/4 selectivity of pyridines and enables the selective late-stage functionalization of a range of complex pyridyl-containing motifs.

Super-resolution labelling with Action-PAINT

Recent advances in localization-based super-resolution microscopy have enabled researchers to visualize single molecular features down to individual molecular components (~5 nm), but do not yet allow manipulation of single-molecule targets in a user-prescribed, context-dependent manner. Here we report an ‘Action-PAINT’ (PAINT, point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography) strategy for super-resolution labelling upon visualization on single molecules. This approach monitors and localizes DNA binding events in real time with DNA-PAINT, and upon visualization of binding to a desired location, photo-crosslinks the DNA to affix the molecular label. We showed the efficiency of 3-cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside photo-inducible crosslinking on single molecular targets and developed a software package for real-time super-resolution imaging and crosslinking control. We then benchmarked our super-resolution labelling method on synthetic DNA nanostructures and demonstrated targeted multipoint labelling on various complex patterns with 30 nm selectivity. Finally, we performed targeted in situ labelling on fixed microtubule samples with a 40 nm target size and custom-controlled, subdiffraction spacing. Super-resolution microscopy has enabled optical imaging of individual biomolecules on the nanometre scale. Now, a new method has been developed that allows active manipulation of single-molecule targets on visualization in a sequential manner. This method, called ‘Action-PAINT’, combines real-time super-resolution microscopy (DNA-PAINT) and photoinducible crosslinking chemistry to deliver a single-molecule cargo with &lt;30 nm selectivity.

Controlled growth of ordered monolayers of N-heterocyclic carbenes on silicon

N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are promising modifiers and anchors for surface functionalization and offer some advantages over thiol-based systems. Because of their strong binding affinity and high electron donation, NHCs can dramatically change the properties of the surfaces to which they are bonded. Highly ordered NHC monolayers have so far been limited to metal surfaces. Silicon, however, remains the element of choice in semiconductor devices and its modification is therefore of utmost importance for electronic industries. Here, a comprehensive study on the adsorption of NHCs on silicon is presented. We find covalently bound NHC molecules in an upright adsorption geometry and demonstrate the formation of highly ordered monolayers exhibiting good thermal stability and strong work function reductions. The structure and ordering of the monolayers is controlled by the substrate geometry and reactivity and in particular by the NHC side groups. These findings pave the way towards a tailor-made organic functionalization of silicon surfaces and, thanks to the high modularity of NHCs, new electronic and optoelectronic applications. Although monolayers of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) readily form on metals, surface reactivity usually hinders their self-assembly on semiconductors. Now, it has been shown that thermally stable, well-ordered monolayers of NHCs can be formed on silicon surfaces. A large reduction in work function is observed and steric effects enable sufficient diffusivity of the NHCs.

Targeted activation in localized protein environments via deep red photoredox catalysis

State-of-the-art photoactivation strategies in chemical biology provide spatiotemporal control and visualization of biological processes. However, using high-energy light (λ &lt; 500 nm) for substrate or photocatalyst sensitization can lead to background activation of photoactive small-molecule probes and reduce its efficacy in complex biological environments. Here we describe the development of targeted aryl azide activation via deep red-light (λ = 660 nm) photoredox catalysis and its use in photocatalysed proximity labelling. We demonstrate that aryl azides are converted to triplet nitrenes via a redox-centric mechanism and show that its spatially localized formation requires both red light and a photocatalyst-targeting modality. This technology was applied in different colon cancer cell systems for targeted protein environment labelling of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). We identified a small subset of proteins with previously known and unknown association to EpCAM, including CDH3, a clinically relevant protein that shares high tumour-selective expression with EpCAM. Technologies for profiling biological environments with high spatiotemporal resolution are in demand to enable the discovery of new targets for addressing unmet clinical needs. Now, a deep red light-mediated photocatalytic strategy for the targeted activation of aryl azides has been developed. This platform enables mapping of protein microenvironments in physiologically relevant systems.

Regio- and diastereoselective intermolecular [2+2] cycloadditions photocatalysed by quantum dots

Light-driven [2+2] cycloaddition is the most direct strategy to build tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes, core components of many lead compounds for drug development. Significant advances in the chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity of [2+2] photocycloadditions have been made, but exceptional and tunable diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity (head-to-head versus head-to-tail adducts) is required for the synthesis of bioactive molecules. Here we show that colloidal quantum dots serve as visible-light chromophores, photocatalysts and reusable scaffolds for homo- and hetero-intermolecular [2+2] photocycloadditions of 4-vinylbenzoic acid derivatives, including aryl-conjugated alkenes, with up to 98% switchable regioselectivity and 98% diastereoselectivity for the previously minor syn-cyclobutane products. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms that our system demonstrates catalysis triggered by triplet–triplet energy transfer from the quantum dot. The precisely controlled triplet energy levels of the quantum dot photocatalysts facilitate efficient and selective heterocoupling, a major challenge in direct cyclobutane synthesis. Tuning the selectivity for [2+2] photocycloadditions remains challenging. Now, triplet–triplet energy transfer from CdSe quantum dots enables the homo- and heterocouplings of 4-vinylbenzoic acid derivatives via [2+2] photocycloaddition. Preorganization of substrates on the quantum dots reverses intrinsic stereoelectronic preferences to yield cyclobutane products with unprecedented diastereo- and regioselectivity.

Nature-inspired methylated polyhydroxybutyrates from C1 and C4 feedstocks

Polyolefin plastics are widely used due to their low cost and outstanding properties, but their environmental persistence presents a major societal challenge. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are biodegradable substitutes for polyolefins, but their high cost and thermal instability are impediments to their widespread application. Here we report a series of methylated polyhydroxybutyrates, poly(3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate)s, which are structurally inspired by natural PHAs. The cis homopolymers exhibit tacticity-independent crystallinity, which allows for the discovery of high-melting, thermally stable and mechanically tough copolymers, and a full range of polyolefin-like properties can be further achieved by tailoring the cis/trans ratio of the repeating units. Moreover, these materials can be synthesized from inexpensive carbon monoxide and 2-butene feedstocks, and they can be chemically recycled or upcycled at their end of life. The versatile properties, abundant feedstocks and end-of-life utility of this family of polyesters will enable a powerful platform for the discovery of sustainable alternatives to polyolefin plastics. Polyhydroxyalkanoates are potential substitutes for non-degradable polyolefin plastics. Now, it has been shown that structurally related methylated polyhydroxybutyrates, synthesized from carbon monoxide and 2-butenes, can provide a full suite of polyolefin-like polymers. These materials can be recycled or upcycled, and their properties can be easily tuned by varying the cis/trans ratio of the starting materials.

Tunable acetylene sorption by flexible catenated metal–organic frameworks

The safe storage of flammable gases, such as acetylene, is essential for current industrial purposes. However, the narrow pressure (P) and temperature range required for the industrial use of pure acetylene (100 &lt; P &lt; 200 kPa at 298 K) and its explosive behaviour at higher pressures make its storage and release challenging. Flexible metal–organic frameworks that exhibit a gated adsorption/desorption behaviour—in which guest uptake and release occur above threshold pressures, usually accompanied by framework deformations—have shown promise as storage adsorbents. Herein, the pressures for gas uptake and release of a series of zinc-based mixed-ligand catenated metal–organic frameworks were controlled by decorating its ligands with two different functional groups and changing their ratio. This affects the deformation energy of the framework, which in turn controls the gated behaviour. The materials offer good performances for acetylene storage with a usable capacity of ~90 v/v (77% of the overall amount) at 298 K and under a practical pressure range (100–150 kPa). Flexible metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in which guest uptake and release occur above certain threshold pressures are attractive adsorbents. Now, the gated sorption behaviour of such a zinc-based mixed-ligand MOF has been tuned to match the narrow temperature and pressure range required for safe, efficient acetylene storage by adjusting the ratio of two different functional groups on its benzenedicarboxylate ligands.

Title: 
Metal-dependent enzyme symmetry guides the biosynthetic flux of terpene precursors

Terpenoids account for more than 60% of all natural products, and their carbon skeletons originate from common isoprenoid units of different lengths such as geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate. Here we characterize a metal-dependent, bifunctional isoprenyl diphosphate synthase from the leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae by structural and functional analyses. Inter- and intramolecular cooperative effects in the homodimer strongly depend on the provided metal ions and regulate the biosynthetic flux of terpene precursors to either biological defence or physiological development. Strikingly, a unique chain length determination domain adapts to form geranyl or farnesyl pyrophosphate by altering enzyme symmetry and ligand affinity between both subunits. In addition, we identify an allosteric geranyl-pyrophosphate-specific binding site that shares similarity with end-product inhibition in human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. Our combined findings elucidate a deeply intertwined reaction mechanism in the P. cochleariae isoprenyl diphosphate synthase that integrates substrate, product and metal-ion concentrations to harness its dynamic potential. The metal-dependent, bifunctional isoprenyl diphosphate synthase PcIDS1 from the leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae integrates substrate, product and metal-ion concentrations to tune its dynamic reactivity. Now structural and functional analyses reveal that this enzyme uses both catalytic centres to form geranyl pyrophosphate, while one domain is inactivated during farnesyl pyrophosphate production.

Improving the efficiency of CO2 electrolysis by using a bipolar membrane with a weak-acid cation exchange layer

The efficient conversion of electricity to chemicals is needed to mitigate the intermittency of renewable energy sources. Driving these electrochemical conversions at useful rates requires not only fast electrode kinetics, but also rapid mass and ion transport. However, little is known about the effect of local environments on ionic flows in solid polymer electrolytes. Here, we show that it is possible to measure and manipulate the local pH in membrane electrolysers with a resolution of tens of nanometres. In bipolar-membrane-based gas-fed CO2 electrolysers, the acidic environment of the cation exchange layer results in low CO2 reduction efficiency. By using ratiometric indicators and layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte assembly, the local pH was measured and controlled within an ~50-nm-thick weak-acid layer. The weak-acid layer suppressed the competing hydrogen evolution reaction without affecting CO2 reduction. This method of probing and controlling the local membrane environment may be useful in devices such as electrolysers, fuel cells and flow batteries, as well as in operando studies of ion distributions within polymer electrolytes. Moving towards renewable energy sources requires pathways for efficiently converting electricity to chemicals, and gas-fed CO2 electrolysers show promise. Now, the layer-by-layer assembly of a weak-acid cation exchange layer has been shown to affect the local pH in a bipolar-membrane-based gas-fed CO2 electrolyser, improving the conversion efficiency of CO2 to CO by suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.

Title: 
A dissipative pathway for the structural evolution of DNA fibres

Biochemical networks interconnect, grow and evolve to express new properties as different chemical pathways are selected during a continuous cycle of energy consumption and transformation. In contrast, synthetic systems that push away from equilibrium usually return to the same self-assembled state, often generating waste that limits system recyclability and prevents the formation of adaptable networks. Here we show that annealing by slow proton dissipation selects for otherwise inaccessible morphologies of fibres built from DNA and cyanuric acid. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we observe that proton dissipation influences the growth mechanism of supramolecular polymerization, healing gaps within fibres and converting highly branched, interwoven networks into nanocable superstructures. Just as the growth kinetics of natural fibres determine their structural attributes to modulate function, our system of photoacid-enabled depolymerization and repolymerization selects for healed materials to yield organized, robust fibres. Our method provides a chemical route for error-checking, distinct from thermal annealing, that improves the morphologies and properties of supramolecular materials using out-of-equilibrium systems. Nature uses out-of-equilibrium systems to control hierarchical assembly. Now, a dissipative chemical system has been shown to slowly release monomer DNA strands from a high-energy reservoir, regulating self-assembly by switching the mechanism of supramolecular polymerization at the single-molecule level. This process heals fibre defects, converting branched, heterogeneous networks into nanocable superstructures.

Title: 
A synthetic genetic polymer with an uncharged backbone chemistry based on alkyl phosphonate nucleic acids

The physicochemical properties of nucleic acids are dominated by their highly charged phosphodiester backbone chemistry. This polyelectrolyte structure decouples information content (base sequence) from bulk properties, such as solubility, and has been proposed as a defining trait of all informational polymers. However, this conjecture has not been tested experimentally. Here, we describe the encoded synthesis of a genetic polymer with an uncharged backbone chemistry: alkyl phosphonate nucleic acids (phNAs) in which the canonical, negatively charged phosphodiester is replaced by an uncharged P-alkyl phosphonodiester backbone. Using synthetic chemistry and polymerase engineering, we describe the enzymatic, DNA-templated synthesis of P-methyl and P-ethyl phNAs, and the directed evolution of specific streptavidin-binding phNA aptamer ligands directly from random-sequence mixed P-methyl/P-ethyl phNA repertoires. Our results establish an example of the DNA-templated enzymatic synthesis and evolution of an uncharged genetic polymer and provide a foundational methodology for their exploration as a source of novel functional molecules. The highly charged phosphodiester chemistry of the natural nucleic acids DNA and RNA has been widely considered to be indispensable for their function as informational molecules. Now, synthetic genetic polymers with an uncharged alkyl phosphonate backbone chemistry have been shown to enable genetic information transfer and evolution.

Title: 
Formation of a super-dense hydrogen monolayer on mesoporous silica

Adsorption on various adsorbents of hydrogen and helium at temperatures close to their boiling points shows, in some cases, unusually high monolayer capacities. The microscopic nature of these adsorbate phases at low temperatures has, however, remained challenging to characterize. Here, using high-resolution cryo-adsorption studies together with characterization by inelastic neutron scattering vibration spectroscopy, we show that, near its boiling point (~20 K), H2 adsorbed on a well-ordered mesoporous silica forms a two-dimensional monolayer with a density more than twice that of bulk-solid H2, rather than a bilayer. Theoretical studies, based on thorough first-principles calculations, rationalize the formation of such a super-dense phase. The strong compression of the hydrogen surface layer is due to the excess of surface–hydrogen attraction over intermolecular hydrogen repulsion. Use of this super-dense hydrogen monolayer on an adsorbent might be a feasible option for the storage of hydrogen near its boiling point, compared with adsorption at 77 K. In some cases, hydrogen adsorption close to its boiling temperature shows unusually high monolayer capacities, but the microscopic nature of this adsorbate phase is not well understood. Now, H2 adsorbed on a well-ordered mesoporous silica surface has been shown to form a 2D monolayer with very short H2···H2 intermolecular distances and a density more than twice that of bulk-solid H2.

Title: 
Rapid desolvation-triggered domino lattice rearrangement in a metal–organic framework

Topological transitions between considerably different phases typically require harsh conditions to collectively break chemical bonds and overcome the stress caused to the original structure by altering its correlated bond environment. In this work we present a case system that can achieve rapid rearrangement of the whole lattice of a metal–organic framework through a domino alteration of the bond connectivity under mild conditions. The system transforms from a disordered metal–organic framework with low porosity to a highly porous and crystalline isomer within 40 s following activation (solvent exchange and desolvation), resulting in a substantial increase in surface area from 725 to 2,749 m2 g–1. Spectroscopic measurements show that this counter-intuitive lattice rearrangement involves a metastable intermediate that results from solvent removal on coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. This disordered–crystalline switch between two topological distinct metal–organic frameworks is shown to be reversible over four cycles through activation and reimmersion in polar solvents. A disordered metal–organic framework converts into a more porous, crystalline phase within 40 s following solvent exchange and desolvation. The rapid domino rearrangement of the whole lattice, which involves carboxylate migration on coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, is accompanied by a substantial increase in surface area.

Title: 
Concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitutions

Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is one of the most widely applied reaction classes in pharmaceutical and chemical research, providing a broadly useful platform for the modification of aromatic ring scaffolds. The generally accepted mechanism for SNAr reactions involves a two-step addition–elimination sequence via a discrete, non-aromatic Meisenheimer complex. Here we use 12C/13C kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies and computational analyses to provide evidence that prototypical SNAr reactions in fact proceed through concerted mechanisms. The KIE measurements were made possible by a new technique that leverages the high sensitivity of 19F as an NMR nucleus to quantitate the degree of isotopic fractionation. This sensitive technique permits the measurement of KIEs on 10 mg of natural abundance material in one overnight acquisition. As a result, it provides a practical tool for performing detailed mechanistic analyses of reactions that form or break C–F bonds. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions have long been thought to occur primarily via stepwise mechanisms. New and sensitive methodology for measuring carbon kinetic isotope effects now shows that most such substitutions actually occur through concerted mechanisms.

Ultrafast X-ray scattering reveals vibrational coherence following Rydberg excitation

The coherence and dephasing of vibrational motions of molecules constitute an integral part of chemical dynamics, influence material properties and underpin schemes to control chemical reactions. Considerable progress has been made in understanding vibrational coherence through spectroscopic measurements, but precise, direct measurement of the structure of a vibrating excited-state polyatomic organic molecule has remained unworkable. Here, we measure the time-evolving molecular structure of optically excited N-methylmorpholine through scattering with ultrashort X-ray pulses. The scattering signals are corrected for the differences in electron density in the excited electronic state of the molecule in comparison to the ground state. The experiment maps the evolution of the molecular geometry with femtosecond resolution, showing coherent motion that survives electronic relaxation and seems to persist for longer than previously seen using other methods. Quantum coherence and dephasing in molecular motions determine the behaviour of many chemical reactions and are the fundamental basis for the concept of coherent control. Now, ultrafast X-ray scattering combined with a detailed structural determination analysis precisely measures the coherent vibrational motions of a polyatomic organic molecule following photoexcitation.

Title: 
Long-range ordered and atomic-scale control of graphene hybridization by photocycloaddition

Chemical reactions that convert sp2 to sp3 hybridization have been demonstrated to be a fascinating yet challenging route to functionalize graphene. So far it has not been possible to precisely control the reaction sites nor their lateral order at the atomic/molecular scale. The application prospects have been limited for reactions that require long soaking, heating, electric pulses or probe-tip press. Here we demonstrate a spatially selective photocycloaddition reaction of a two-dimensional molecular network with defect-free basal plane of single-layer graphene. Directly visualized at the submolecular level, the cycloaddition is triggered by ultraviolet irradiation in ultrahigh vacuum, requiring no aid of the graphene Moiré pattern. The reaction involves both [2+2] and [2+4] cycloadditions, with the reaction sites aligned into a two-dimensional extended and well-ordered array, inducing a bandgap for the reacted graphene layer. This work provides a solid base for designing and engineering graphene-based optoelectronic and microelectronic devices. The controllable functionalization of graphene at the molecular level may prove useful for graphene-based electronics, but is difficult to do in a precise fashion. Now it has been shown that a photocycloaddition reaction between a hydrogen-bonded network of maleimide-derived molecules and single-layer graphene can produce a functionalized array with long-range order.

Title: 
Enhanced reactivity of twisted amides inside a molecular cage

When an amide group is distorted from its planar conformation, the conjugation between the nitrogen lone pair and the π* orbital of the carbonyl is disrupted and the reactivity towards nucleophiles is enhanced. Although there are several reports on the synthesis of activated twisted amides, amide activation through mechanical twisting is much less common. Here, we report twisted amides that are stabilized through their inclusion in a self-assembled coordination cage. When secondary aromatic amides are included in a Td-symmetric cage, the cis-twisted conformation is favoured over the trans-planar one—as evidenced by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis—revealing that the amide can twist by up to 34°. As a consequence of this distortion, the hydrolysis of amides is significantly accelerated upon inclusion. The distortion of an amide group away from a planar conformation typically enhances its reactivity and such activation is usually achieved through the chemical synthesis of twisted amides. Now, it has been shown that a non-covalent activation strategy leading to accelerated hydrolysis can be achieved by binding a reactive twisted amide conformer inside a molecular cage.

A general strategy for synthesis of cyclophane-braced peptide macrocycles via palladium-catalysed intramolecular sp3 C−H arylation

New methods capable of effecting cyclization, and forming novel three-dimensional structures while maintaining favourable physicochemical properties are needed to facilitate the development of cyclic peptide-based drugs that can engage challenging biological targets, such as protein–protein interactions. Here, we report a highly efficient and generally applicable strategy for constructing new types of peptide macrocycles using palladium-catalysed intramolecular C(sp3)–H arylation reactions. Easily accessible linear peptide precursors of simple and versatile design can be selectively cyclized at the side chains of either aromatic or modified non-aromatic amino acid units to form various cyclophane-braced peptide cycles. This strategy provides a powerful tool to address the long-standing challenge of size- and composition-dependence in peptide macrocyclization, and generates novel peptide macrocycles with uniquely buttressed backbones and distinct loop-type three-dimensional structures. Preliminary cell proliferation screening of the pilot library revealed a potent lead compound with selective cytotoxicity toward proliferative Myc-dependent cancer cell lines. Peptide macrocycles are uniquely suited to engage some challenging biological targets, such as protein–protein interactions. Inspired by the ‘C–H’ cross-linked peptide natural products, a highly efficient and generally applicable strategy for constructing cyclophane-braced peptide macrocycles has been developed. The strategy is based on palladium-catalysed intramolecular C(sp3)–H arylation reactions.

Title: 
φ-Aromaticity in prismatic {Bi6}-based clusters

The occurrence of aromaticity in organic molecules is widely accepted, but its occurrence in purely metallic systems is less widespread. Molecules comprising only metal atoms (M) are known to be able to exhibit aromatic behaviour, sustaining ring currents inside an external magnetic field along M–M connection axes (σ-aromaticity) or above and below the plane (π-aromaticity) for cyclic or cage-type compounds. However, all-metal compounds provide an extension of the electrons’ mobility also in other directions. Here, we show that regular {Bi6} prisms exhibit a non-localizable molecular orbital of f-type symmetry and generate a strong ring current that leads to a behaviour referred to as φ-aromaticity. The experimentally observed heterometallic cluster [{CpRu}3Bi6]–, based on a regular prismatic {Bi6} unit, displays aromatic behaviour; according to quantum chemical calculations, the corresponding hypothetical Bi62− prism shows a similar behaviour. By contrast, [{(cod)Ir}3Bi6] features a distorted Bi6 moiety that inhibits φ-aromaticity. Aromaticity is a ubiquitous concept in organic chemistry yet it is less widespread for inorganic species. Now the cluster [(CpRu)3Bi6]–, obtained as part of a soluble salt, has been shown to exhibit aromatic behaviour referred to as φ-type, owing to a highly regular {Bi6} substructure causing a non-localizable molecular orbital of $$f_{z^3}$$ -like symmetry.

Title: 
Protein nanopore reveals the renin–angiotensin system crosstalk with single-amino-acid resolution

The discovery of crosstalk effects on the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is limited by the lack of approaches to quantitatively monitor, in real time, multiple components with subtle differences and short half-lives. Here we report a nanopore framework to quantitatively determine the effect of the hidden crosstalk between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on RAS. By developing an engineered aerolysin nanopore capable of single-amino-acid resolution, we show that the ACE can be selectively inhibited by ACE2 to prevent cleavage of angiotensin I, even when the concentration of ACE is more than 30-fold higher than that of ACE2. We also show that the activity of ACE2 for cleaving angiotensin peptides is clearly suppressed by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This leads to the relaxation of ACE and the increased probability of accumulation of the principal effector angiotensin II. The spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is demonstrated to have a much greater impact on the crosstalk than the wild type. A nanopore framework has been developed to reveal the crosstalk effect on the renin–angiotensin system. By reading the single-amino-acid differences in angiotensin peptides with high accuracy and high efficiency, the selective inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was revealed. This activity was shown to be suppressed by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

Fragment-derived inhibitors of human N-myristoyltransferase block capsid assembly and replication of the common cold virus

Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the pathogens most often responsible for the common cold, and are a frequent cause of exacerbations in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Here we report the discovery of IMP-1088, a picomolar dual inhibitor of the human N-myristoyltransferases NMT1 and NMT2, and use it to demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of host-cell N-myristoylation rapidly and completely prevents rhinoviral replication without inducing cytotoxicity. The identification of cooperative binding between weak-binding fragments led to rapid inhibitor optimization through fragment reconstruction, structure-guided fragment linking and conformational control over linker geometry. We show that inhibition of the co-translational myristoylation of a specific virus-encoded protein (VP0) by IMP-1088 potently blocks a key step in viral capsid assembly, to deliver a low nanomolar antiviral activity against multiple RV strains, poliovirus and foot and-mouth disease virus, and protection of cells against virus-induced killing, highlighting the potential of host myristoylation as a drug target in picornaviral infections. An effective antiviral against the common cold could prevent exacerbations in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the diversity and adaptability of the virus makes it a highly challenging target. Now, picomolar inhibitors of a human lipid transferase have been developed. Targeting this human lipid transferase could provide an effective and broad-spectrum approach to block viral replication in the host.

Differentiation and functionalization of remote C–H bonds in adjacent positions

Site-selective functionalization of C–H bonds will ultimately afford chemists transformative tools for editing and constructing complex molecular architectures. Towards this goal, it is essential to develop strategies to activate C–H bonds that are distal from a functional group. In this context, distinguishing remote C–H bonds on adjacent carbon atoms is an extraordinary challenge due to the lack of electronic or steric bias between the two positions. Herein, we report the design of a catalytic system leveraging a remote directing template and a transient norbornene mediator to selectively activate a previously inaccessible remote C–H bond that is one bond further away. The generality of this approach has been demonstrated with a range of heterocycles, including a complex anti-leukaemia agent and hydrocinnamic acid substrates. Distinguishing remote C–H bonds on adjacent carbon atoms is a fundamental challenge because of a lack of electronic or steric bias. Now, differentiation of distal C–H bonds that are adjacent to each other has been achieved by combining selective remote C–H activation—based on distance and geometry—with a norbornene-assisted palladium migration.

A general approach to intermolecular carbonylation of arene C–H bonds to ketones through catalytic aroyl triflate formation

The development of metal-catalysed methods to functionalize inert C–H bonds has become a dominant research theme in the past decade as an approach to efficient synthesis. However, the incorporation of carbon monoxide into such reactions to form valuable ketones has to date proved a challenge, despite its potential as a straightforward and green alternative to Friedel–Crafts reactions. Here we describe a new approach to palladium-catalysed C–H bond functionalization in which carbon monoxide is used to drive the generation of high-energy electrophiles. This offers a method to couple the useful features of metal-catalysed C–H functionalization (stable and available reagents) and electrophilic acylations (broad scope and selectivity), and synthesize ketones simply from aryl iodides, CO and arenes. Notably, the reaction proceeds in an intermolecular fashion, without directing groups and at very low palladium-catalyst loadings. Mechanistic studies show that the reaction proceeds through the catalytic build-up of potent aroyl triflate electrophiles. Catalytic transformations that incorporate carbonyl functional groups in arene C–H bonds have remained limited, despite being attractive synthetic steps. Now, the intermolecular carbonylative coupling of a broad range of simple arenes into ketones has been developed. The reaction occurs through the palladium-catalysed generation of high-energy aroyl triflate electrophiles.

Title: 
Cavitation energies can outperform dispersion interactions

The accurate dissection of binding energies into their microscopic components is challenging, especially in solution. Here we study the binding of noble gases (He–Xe) with the macrocyclic receptor cucurbit[5]uril in water by displacement of methane and ethane as 1H NMR probes. We dissect the hydration free energies of the noble gases into an attractive dispersive component and a repulsive one for formation of a cavity in water. This allows us to identify the contributions to host–guest binding and to conclude that the binding process is driven by differential cavitation energies rather than dispersion interactions. The free energy required to create a cavity to accept the noble gas inside the cucurbit[5]uril is much lower than that to create a similarly sized cavity in bulk water. The recovery of the latter cavitation energy drives the overall process, which has implications for the refinement of gas-storage materials and the understanding of biological receptors. Binding interactions, whether between a biological receptor and ligand or between a synthetic host and guest, are frequently stronger for larger molecules than for smaller ones. This is commonly believed to arise from increased dispersion interactions, but it has now been shown that cavitation energies—always required to dissolve molecules in solution—can be more important.

Scattering resonances in bimolecular collisions between NO radicals and H2 challenge the theoretical gold standard

Over the last 25 years, the formalism known as coupled-cluster (CC) theory has emerged as the method of choice for the ab initio calculation of intermolecular interaction potentials. The implementation known as CCSD(T) is often referred to as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. It gives excellent agreement with experimental observations for a variety of energy-transfer processes in molecular collisions, and it is used to calibrate density functional theory. Here, we present measurements of low-energy collisions between NO radicals and H2 molecules with a resolution that challenges the most sophisticated quantum chemistry calculations at the CCSD(T) level. Using hitherto-unexplored anti-seeding techniques to reduce the collision energy in a crossed-beam inelastic-scattering experiment, a resonance structure near 14 cm−1 is clearly resolved in the state-to-state integral cross-section, and a unique resonance fingerprint is observed in the corresponding differential cross-section. This resonance structure discriminates between two NO–H2 potentials calculated at the CCSD(T) level and pushes the required accuracy beyond the gold standard. Calculations at the theoretical gold standard generally yield accurate results for a variety of energy-transfer processes in molecular collisions. Using anti-seeding methods in a crossed-beam inelastic scattering experiment, a resonance structure is clearly resolved for NO–H2 collisions, pushing the required accuracy for theoretical potentials beyond the gold standard.

An automated platform for the enzyme-mediated assembly of complex oligosaccharides

An automated platform that can synthesize a wide range of complex carbohydrates will greatly increase their accessibility and should facilitate progress in glycoscience. Here we report a fully automated process for enzyme-mediated oligosaccharide synthesis that can give easy access to different classes of complex glycans including poly-N-acetyllactosamine derivatives, human milk oligosaccharides, gangliosides and N-glycans. Our automated platform uses a catch and release approach in which glycosyltransferase-catalysed reactions are performed in solution and product purification is accomplished by solid phase extraction. We developed a sulfonate tag that can easily be installed and enables highly efficient solid phase extraction and product release using a single set of washing conditions, regardless of the complexity of the glycan. Using this custom-built synthesizer, as many as 15 reaction cycles can be performed in an automated fashion without a need for lyophilization or buffer exchange steps. An automated platform that can synthesize a wide range of complex glycans could greatly facilitate progress in glycoscience. Now, a fully automated process for enzyme-mediated oligosaccharide synthesis has been developed. This process uses glycosyltransferase-catalysed reactions performed in solution, with product purification being accomplished by solid phase extraction using a sulfonate tag.

RNA origami design tools enable cotranscriptional folding of kilobase-sized nanoscaffolds

RNA origami is a framework for the modular design of nanoscaffolds that can be folded from a single strand of RNA and used to organize molecular components with nanoscale precision. The design of genetically expressible RNA origami, which must fold cotranscriptionally, requires modelling and design tools that simultaneously consider thermodynamics, the folding pathway, sequence constraints and pseudoknot optimization. Here, we describe RNA Origami Automated Design software (ROAD), which builds origami models from a library of structural modules, identifies potential folding barriers and designs optimized sequences. Using ROAD, we extend the scale and functional diversity of RNA scaffolds, creating 32 designs of up to 2,360 nucleotides, five that scaffold two proteins, and seven that scaffold two small molecules at precise distances. Micrographic and chromatographic comparisons of optimized and non-optimized structures validate that our principles for strand routing and sequence design substantially improve yield. By providing efficient design of RNA origami, ROAD may simplify the construction of custom RNA scaffolds for nanomedicine and synthetic biology. RNA origami can be used for the modular design of RNA nanoscaffolds but can be challenging to design. Newly developed computer-aided design software has now been shown to improve the folding yield of kilobase-sized RNA origami. These structures fold from a single strand during transcription by an RNA polymerase, and are able to position small molecules and protein components with nanoscale precision.

Metal ion fluxes controlling amphibian fertilization

Mammalian oocytes undergo major changes in zinc content and localization to be fertilized, the most striking being the rapid exocytosis of over 10 billion zinc ions in what are known as zinc sparks. Here, we report that fertilization of amphibian Xenopus laevis eggs also initiates a zinc spark that progresses across the cell surface in coordination with dynamic calcium waves. This zinc exocytosis is accompanied by a newly recognized loss of intracellular manganese. Synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence and analytical electron microscopy reveal that zinc and manganese are sequestered in a system of cortical granules that are abundant at the animal pole. Through electron–nuclear double-resonance studies, we rule out Mn2+ complexation with phosphate or nitrogenous ligands in intact eggs, but the data are consistent with a carboxylate coordination environment. Our observations suggest that zinc and manganese fluxes are a conserved feature of fertilization in vertebrates and that they function as part of a physiological block to polyspermy. Zinc fluxes have now been shown to be essential in the fertilization of amphibian eggs. Furthermore, manganese(ii), which is initially bound to low-molecular-weight carboxylates, is stored and released with zinc from cortical vesicles following fertilization. This rapid metal ion release blocks the otherwise fatal entry of a second sperm.

Photochemical generation of radicals from alkyl electrophiles using a nucleophilic organic catalyst

Chemists extensively use free radical reactivity for applications in organic synthesis, materials science, and life science. Traditionally, generating radicals requires strategies that exploit the bond dissociation energy or the redox properties of the precursors. Here, we disclose a photochemical catalytic approach that harnesses different physical properties of the substrate to form carbon radicals. We use a nucleophilic dithiocarbamate anion catalyst, adorned with a well-tailored chromophoric unit, to activate alkyl electrophiles via an SN2 pathway. The resulting photon-absorbing intermediate affords radicals upon homolytic cleavage induced by visible light. This catalytic SN2-based strategy, which exploits a fundamental mechanistic process of ionic chemistry, grants access to open-shell intermediates from a variety of substrates that would be incompatible with or inert to classical radical-generating strategies. We also describe how the method’s mild reaction conditions and high functional group tolerance could be advantageous for developing C–C bond-forming reactions, for streamlining the preparation of a marketed drug, for the late-stage elaboration of biorelevant compounds and for enantioselective radical catalysis. The SN2 reaction, a fundamental process associated with ionic chemistry, can be incorporated into a photochemical approach to creating radicals from alkyl electrophiles. This method occurs readily under visible-light irradiation, exhibits broad functional-group tolerance, and enables the formation of open-shell intermediates from substrates that are incompatible with traditional radical-generating strategies.

A bis(silylene)-stabilized diphosphorus compound and its reactivity as a monophosphorus anion transfer reagent

In contrast to the well-established transition-metal-mediated activation of white phosphorus (P4), the metal-free direct functionalization of P4 has remained rare. The conversion of P4 into a reactive zero-valent diphosphorus compound (P2) has proven challenging to carry out without relying on metal reactivity. Herein, we describe the facile degradation of P4 mediated by two divalent silicon atoms in a bis(silylene) scaffold, resulting in a silylene-stabilized zero-valent P2 complex. The presence of two lone pairs of electrons on each P atom in the silylene-stabilized P2 complex enables a rich reactivity towards small molecules; reaction of the P2 species with CO2, water or a borane leads to the formation of P–C, P–H or P–B bonds, respectively. Notably, the P2 complex also serves as a single phosphorus anion (P−) transfer reagent towards metal carbonyls and a chlorogermylene compound, leading to the synthetically valuable phosphaketenide (PCO−) ligand and a phosphinidene germylene complex, respectively. White phosphorus (P4) is very reactive but is relatively difficult to activate without relying on transition metals. Now, it has been shown that the degradation of P4 can be mediated by two divalent silicon atoms in a bis(silylene) scaffold to give a diphosphorus complex that can be further functionalized and also act as a P− transfer agent.

A circular polyester platform based on simple gem-disubstituted valerolactones

Geminal disubstitution of cyclic monomers is an effective strategy to enhance the chemical recyclability of their polymers, but it is utilized for that purpose alone and often at the expense of performance properties. Here we present synergistic use of gem-α,α-disubstitution of available at-scale, bio-based δ-valerolactones to yield gem-dialkyl-substituted valerolactones ( $${\rm{VL}}^{{\rm{R}}_{2}}$$ ), which generate polymers that solve not only the poor chemical recyclability but also the low melting temperature and mechanical performance of the parent poly(δ-valerolactone); the gem-disubstituted polyesters ( $${\rm{PVL}}^{{\rm{R}}_{2}}$$ ) therefore not only exhibit complete chemical recyclability but also thermal, mechanical and transport properties that rival or exceed those of polyethylene. Through a fundamental structure–property study that reveals intriguing impacts of the alkyl chain length on materials performance of $${\rm{PVL}}^{{\rm{R}}_{2}}$$ , this work establishes a simple circular, high-performance polyester platform based on $${\rm{VL}}^{{\rm{R}}_{2}}$$ and highlights the importance of synergistic utilization of gem-disubstitution for enhancing both chemical recyclability and materials performance of sustainable polyesters. Geminal disubstitution of cyclic monomers is known to improve the chemical recyclability of their polymers, but usually at the expense of performance properties. Now, geminal disubstitution of a six-membered lactone has been shown to synergistically enable chemical recyclability back to the monomer and enhance the materials performance of the resulting polyesters, with properties that rival or exceed those of polyethylene.

A versatile approach for the synthesis of degradable polymers via controlled ring-opening metathesis copolymerization

Norbornene derivatives (NBEs) are common monomers for living ring-opening metathesis polymerization and yield polymers with low dispersities and diverse functionalities. However, the all-carbon backbone of poly-NBEs is non-degradable. Here we report a method to synthesize degradable polymers by copolymerizing 2,3-dihydrofuran with NBEs. 2,3-Dihydrofuran rapidly reacts with Grubbs catalyst to form a thermodynamically stable Ru Fischer carbene—the only detectable active Ru species during copolymerization—and the addition of NBEs becomes rate determining. This reactivity attenuates the NBE homoaddition and allows uniform incorporation of acid-degradable enol ether linkages throughout the copolymers, which enables complete polymer degradation while maintaining the favourable characteristics of living ring-opening metathesis polymerization. Copolymerization of 2,3-dihydrofuran with NBEs gives low dispersity polymers with tunable solubility, glass transition temperature and mechanical properties. These polymers can be fully degraded into small molecule or oligomeric species under mildly acidic conditions. This method can be readily adapted to traditional ring-opening metathesis polymerization of widely used NBEs to synthesize easily degradable polymers with tunable properties for various applications and for environmental sustainability. Degradable polymers are important for technological applications and sustainability, but they remain difficult to access via ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Now, commercial 2,3-dihydrofuran is shown to be an effective ROMP comonomer for various norbornenes. This copolymerization generates new acid-degradable polymers with controlled molecular weights, different functionalities and tunable properties.

Immobilization of molecular catalysts on electrode surfaces using host–guest interactions

Anchoring molecular catalysts on electrode surfaces combines the high selectivity and activity of molecular systems with the practicality of heterogeneous systems. Molecular catalysts, however, are far less stable than traditional heterogeneous electrocatalysts, and therefore a method to easily replace anchored molecular catalysts that have degraded could make such electrosynthetic systems more attractive. Here we applied a non-covalent ‘click’ chemistry approach to reversibly bind molecular electrocatalysts to electrode surfaces through host–guest complexation with surface-anchored cyclodextrins. The host–guest interaction is remarkably strong and enables the flow of electrons between the electrode and the guest catalyst. Electrosynthesis in both organic and aqueous media was demonstrated on metal oxide electrodes, with stability on the order of hours. The catalytic surfaces can be recycled by controlled release of the guest from the host cavities and the readsorption of fresh guest. Molecular catalysts can be made more practical by anchoring them onto electrode surfaces, but such systems are less stable than standard heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Now, supramolecular hosts bound to electrode surfaces have enabled the immobilization of molecular electrocatalysts through host–guest interactions. Desorbed or degraded guest molecules can be replaced with fresh guest molecules, extending their lifetimes.

Synthesis of a zigzag carbon nanobelt

The structure-selective precise synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been long sought in materials science. The aromatic molecules corresponding to segment structures of CNTs, that is, carbon nanobelts (CNBs), are of interest as templates for CNT growth. Among the three types of CNB (armchair, chiral and zigzag CNBs), zigzag CNBs have been considered the most difficult type to synthesize. Here we report the synthesis, isolation and structural characterization of a zigzag CNB. The synthesis involves an iterative Diels–Alder reaction sequence followed by reductive aromatization of oxygen-bridged moieties. As predicted by theoretical calculations, this CNB was isolated as a stable compound. The structure of the zigzag CNB was fully characterized by X-ray crystallography and its wide energy gap with blue fluorescence properties was revealed by photophysical measurements. With synthetic strategies towards all three types of CNB in hand, the road to the precise synthesis of CNTs can now proceed to the next stage. The synthesis of a zigzag carbon nanobelt has been achieved through an iterative Diels–Alder reaction followed by reductive aromatization. The isolated nanobelt was fully characterized by X-ray crystallography and its wide energy gap with blue fluorescence properties was revealed by photophysical measurements.

The role of sugar-backbone heterogeneity and chimeras in the simultaneous emergence of RNA and DNA

Hypotheses of the origins of RNA and DNA are generally centred on the prebiotic synthesis of a pristine system (pre-RNA or RNA), which gives rise to its descendent. However, a lack of specificity in the synthesis of genetic polymers would probably result in chimeric sequences; the roles and fate of such sequences are unknown. Here, we show that chimeras, exemplified by mixed threose nucleic acid (TNA)–RNA and RNA–DNA oligonucleotides, preferentially bind to, and act as templates for, homogeneous TNA, RNA and DNA ligands. The chimeric templates can act as a catalyst that mediates the ligation of oligomers to give homogeneous backbone sequences, and the regeneration of the chimeric templates potentiates a scenario for a possible cross-catalytic cycle with amplification. This process provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of a heterogeneity-to-homogeneity scenario and also gives credence to the idea that DNA could appear concurrently with RNA, instead of being its later descendent. The emergence of pristine RNA and DNA on the early Earth would have been hindered by a lack of specificity in their prebiotic syntheses. Now, it has been shown that chimeric sequences—with a mixture of RNA and DNA backbones—mediate the template-directed ligation of oligomers present in mixtures of nucleic acids, enabling the simultaneous appearance of RNA and DNA.

A general asymmetric copper-catalysed Sonogashira C(sp3)–C(sp) coupling

Continued development of the Sonogashira coupling has made it a well established and versatile reaction for the straightforward formation of C–C bonds, forging the carbon skeletons of broadly useful functionalized molecules. However, asymmetric Sonogashira coupling, particularly for C(sp3)–C(sp) bond formation, has remained largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate a general stereoconvergent Sonogashira C(sp3)–C(sp) cross-coupling of a broad range of terminal alkynes and racemic alkyl halides (&gt;120 examples) that are enabled by copper-catalysed radical-involved alkynylation using a chiral cinchona alkaloid-based P,N-ligand. Industrially relevant acetylene and propyne are successfully incorporated, laying the foundation for scalable and economic synthetic applications. The potential utility of this method is demonstrated in the facile synthesis of stereoenriched bioactive or functional molecule derivatives, medicinal compounds and natural products that feature a range of chiral C(sp3)–C(sp/sp2/sp3) bonds. This work emphasizes the importance of radical species for developing enantioconvergent transformations. Asymmetric Sonogashira C(sp3)–C(sp) couplings provide complementary approaches to established C(sp3)–C(sp2/sp3) couplings for chiral C–C bond formation; however, relatively few reactions have been developed. Now, a versatile, enantioconvergent Sonogashira coupling via a radical intermediate has been developed. The approach uses a copper catalyst featuring a multidentate electron-rich cinchona alkaloid-derived ligand.

Activity-based directed evolution of a membrane editor in mammalian cells

Cellular membranes contain numerous lipid species, and efforts to understand the biological functions of individual lipids have been stymied by a lack of approaches for controlled modulation of membrane composition in situ. Here we present a strategy for editing phospholipids, the most abundant lipids in biological membranes. Our membrane editor is based on a bacterial phospholipase D (PLD), which exchanges phospholipid head groups through hydrolysis or transphosphatidylation of phosphatidylcholine with water or exogenous alcohols. Exploiting activity-dependent directed enzyme evolution in mammalian cells, we have developed and structurally characterized a family of ‘superPLDs’ with up to a 100-fold enhancement in intracellular activity. We demonstrate the utility of superPLDs for both optogenetics-enabled editing of phospholipids within specific organelle membranes in live cells and biocatalytic synthesis of natural and unnatural designer phospholipids in vitro. Beyond the superPLDs, activity-based directed enzyme evolution in mammalian cells is a generalizable approach to engineer additional chemoenzymatic biomolecule editors. Cellular membranes contain numerous lipids, and efforts to understand the biological functions of individual lipids demand approaches for controlled modulation of membrane composition in situ. Now, click chemistry-based directed evolution of a microbial phospholipase within mammalian cells affords an editor for optogenetic, targeted modification of phospholipids in cell membranes.

Conformational and functional changes of the native neuropeptide somatostatin occur in the presence of copper and amyloid-β

The progression of neurodegenerative disorders can lead to impaired neurotransmission; however, the role of pathogenic factors associated with these diseases and their impact on the structures and functions of neurotransmitters have not been clearly established. Here we report the discovery that conformational and functional changes of a native neuropeptide, somatostatin (SST), occur in the presence of copper ions, metal-free amyloid-β (Aβ) and metal-bound Aβ (metal–Aβ) found as pathological factors in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. These pathological elements induce the self-assembly of SST and, consequently, prevent it from binding to the receptor. In the reverse direction, SST notably modifies the aggregation profiles of Aβ species in the presence of metal ions, attenuating their cytotoxicity and interactions with cell membranes. Our work demonstrates a loss of normal function of SST as a neurotransmitter and a gain of its modulative function against metal–Aβ under pathological conditions. Metal-free amyloid-β (Aβ) and metal-bound Aβ (metal–Aβ) are found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Now, it has been shown that the conformation of a native neuropeptide, somatostatin, is changed in the presence of copper ions, Aβ and metal–Aβ. The conformational change results in a loss of function of somatostatin as a neurotransmitter and a gain of function as a modulator against metal–Aβ.

NH3 formation from N2 and H2 mediated by molecular tri-iron complexes

Living systems carry out the reduction of N2 to ammonia (NH3) through a series of protonation and electron transfer steps under ambient conditions using the enzyme nitrogenase. In the chemical industry, the Haber–Bosch process hydrogenates N2 but requires high temperatures and pressures. Both processes rely on iron-based catalysts, but molecular iron complexes that promote the formation of NH3 on addition of H2 to N2 have remained difficult to devise. Here, we isolate the tri(iron)bis(nitrido) complex [(Cp′Fe)3(μ3-N)2] (in which Cp′ = η5-1,2,4-(Me3C)3C5H2), which is prepared by reduction of [Cp′Fe(μ-I)]2 under an N2 atmosphere and comprises three iron centres bridged by two μ3-nitrido ligands. In solution, this complex reacts with H2 at ambient temperature (22 °C) and low pressure (1 or 4 bar) to form NH3. In the solid state, it is converted into the tri(iron)bis(imido) species, [(Cp′Fe)3(μ3-NH)2], by addition of H2 (10 bar) through an unusual solid–gas, single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. In solution, [(Cp′Fe)3(μ3-NH)2] further reacts with H2 or H+ to form NH3. The reduction of N2 to NH3 is mediated in living systems by the enzyme nitrogenase and in the chemical industry by the Haber–Bosch process; both systems rely on iron-based catalysis. Now, a molecular tri(iron)bis(nitrido) complex, prepared by reduction of a bis(iron)bis(iodo) precursor under an N2 atmosphere, has been isolated and shown to promote the formation of NH3 from H2.

Title: 
An autonomous portable platform for universal chemical synthesis

Robotic systems for synthetic chemistry are becoming more common, but they are expensive, fixed to a narrow set of reactions, and must be used within a complex laboratory environment. A portable system that could synthesize known molecules anywhere, on demand, and in a fully automated way, could revolutionize access to important molecules. Here we present a portable suitcase-sized chemical synthesis platform containing all the modules required for synthesis and purification. The system uses a chemical programming language coupled to a digital reactor generator to produce reactors and executable protocols based on text-based literature syntheses. Simultaneously, the platform generates a reaction pressure fingerprint, used to monitor processes within the reactors and remotely perform a protocol quality control. We demonstrate the system by synthesizing five small organic molecules, four oligopeptides and four oligonucleotides, in good yields and purities, with a total of 24,936 base steps executed over 329 h of platform runtime. Automated systems, nowadays more commonly used in laboratory settings, are typically fixed to a narrow set of reactions and used within a complex laboratory environment. Now, a portable platform has been developed for the on-demand and on-site multistep synthesis of organic molecules, oligonucleotides and oligopeptides mapped into reactionware systems.

Title: 
Environmental conditions drive self-organization of reaction pathways in a prebiotic reaction network

The evolution of life from the prebiotic environment required a gradual process of chemical evolution towards greater molecular complexity. Elaborate prebiotically relevant synthetic routes to the building blocks of life have been established. However, it is still unclear how functional chemical systems evolved with direction using only the interaction between inherent molecular chemical reactivity and the abiotic environment. Here we demonstrate how complex systems of chemical reactions exhibit well-defined self-organization in response to varying environmental conditions. This self-organization allows the compositional complexity of the reaction products to be controlled as a function of factors such as feedstock and catalyst availability. We observe how Breslow’s cycle contributes to the reaction composition by feeding C2 building blocks into the network, alongside reaction pathways dominated by formaldehyde-driven chain growth. The emergence of organized systems of chemical reactions in response to changes in the environment offers a potential mechanism for a chemical evolution process that bridges the gap between prebiotic chemical building blocks and the origin of life. The process by which life arose using information from the prebiotic environment and inherent molecular reactivity is unclear. Now, it has been shown that systems of chemical reactions exhibit well-defined self-organization in varying environments, providing a potential mechanism for chemical evolution processes that bridge the gap between prebiotic building blocks and life’s origin.

Release of linker histone from the nucleosome driven by polyelectrolyte competition with a disordered protein

Highly charged intrinsically disordered proteins are essential regulators of chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. Here we identify a surprising mechanism of molecular competition that relies on the pronounced dynamical disorder present in these polyelectrolytes and their complexes. The highly positively charged human linker histone H1.0 (H1) binds to nucleosomes with ultrahigh affinity, implying residence times incompatible with efficient biological regulation. However, we show that the disordered regions of H1 retain their large-amplitude dynamics when bound to the nucleosome, which enables the highly negatively charged and disordered histone chaperone prothymosin α to efficiently invade the H1–nucleosome complex and displace H1 via a competitive substitution mechanism, vastly accelerating H1 dissociation. By integrating experiments and simulations, we establish a molecular model that rationalizes the remarkable kinetics of this process structurally and dynamically. Given the abundance of polyelectrolyte sequences in the nuclear proteome, this mechanism is likely to be widespread in cellular regulation. Histone H1 binds to nucleosomes with ultrahigh affinity, implying residence times incompatible with efficient biological regulation. Now it has been shown that the disordered regions of H1 retain their large-amplitude dynamics on the nucleosome, which enables a charged disordered histone chaperone to invade the H1–nucleosome complex and vastly accelerate H1 dissociation.

Title: 
Interplay of vibrational wavepackets during an ultrafast electron transfer reaction

Electron transfer reactions facilitate energy transduction and photoredox processes in biology and chemistry. Recent findings show that molecular vibrations can enable the dramatic acceleration of some electron transfer reactions, and control it by suppressing and enhancing reaction paths. Here, we report ultrafast spectroscopy experiments and quantum dynamics simulations that resolve how quantum vibrations participate in an electron transfer reaction. We observe ballistic electron transfer (~30 fs) along a reaction coordinate comprising high-frequency promoting vibrations. Along another vibrational coordinate, the system becomes impulsively out of equilibrium as a result of the electron transfer reaction. This leads to the generation (by the electron transfer reaction, not the laser pulse) of a new vibrational coherence along this second reaction coordinate in a mode associated with the reaction product. These results resolve a complex reaction trajectory composed of multiple vibrational coordinates that, like a sequence of ratchets, progressively diminish the recurrence of the reactant state. Electronic–vibrational interplay can enable electron and energy transfer processes to be regulated. Now, coherence spectroscopy has been used to disentangle two vibrational pathways that control an electron transfer reaction. It has been shown that a fast, effectively ballistic, electron transfer along one vibrational path acts like a pulse to generate a coherent wavepacket along another vibrational pathway.

Activation of diverse carbon–heteroatom and carbon–carbon bonds via palladium(ii)-catalysed β-X elimination

Chemists’ ability to synthesize structurally complex, high-value organic molecules from simple starting materials is limited by methods to selectively activate and functionalize strong alkyl C(sp3) covalent bonds. Recent activity has focused on the activation of abundant C–O, C–N and C–C bonds via a mechanistic paradigm of oxidative addition of a low-valent, electron-rich transition metal. This approach typically employs nickel(0), rhodium(i), ruthenium(0) and iron catalysts under conditions finely tuned for specific, electronically activated substrates, sometimes assisted by chelating functional groups or ring strain. By adopting a redox-neutral strategy involving palladium(ii)-catalysed C–H activation followed by β-heteroatom/carbon elimination, we describe here a catalytic method to activate alkyl C(sp3)–oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, fluorine and sulfur bonds with high regioselectivity. Directed hydrofunctionalization of the resultant palladium(ii)-bound alkene leads to formal functional group metathesis. The method is applied to amino acid upgrading with complete regioselectivity and moderate to high retention of enantiomeric excess. Low-strain heterocycles undergo strong-bond activation and substitution, giving ring-opened products. Traditionally, strong-bond activation by transition metals has been achieved through an oxidative addition pathway. Now, a redox-neutral palladium(ii)-catalysed β-elimination strategy has been shown to activate alkyl C–O, N, C, F and S bonds to give an alkene that can be trapped with various nucleophiles. This functional group metathesis allows upgrading of amino acid derivatives and ring-opening of saturated heterocycles.

In situ multiscale probing of the synthesis of a Ni-rich layered oxide cathode reveals reaction heterogeneity driven by competing kinetic pathways

Nickel-rich layered oxides are envisaged as key near-future cathode materials for high-energy lithium-ion batteries. However, their practical application has been hindered by their inferior cycle stability, which originates from chemo-mechanical failures. Here we probe the solid-state synthesis of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 in real time to better understand the structural and/or morphological changes during phase evolution. Multi-length-scale observations—using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, in situ heating transmission electron microscopy and in situ X-ray diffraction—reveal that the overall synthesis is governed by the kinetic competition between the intrinsic thermal decomposition of the precursor at the core and the topotactic lithiation near the interface, which results in spatially heterogeneous intermediates. The thermal decomposition leads to the formation of intergranular voids and intragranular nanopores that are detrimental to cycling stability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that promoting topotactic lithiation during synthesis can mitigate the generation of defective structures and effectively suppress the chemo-mechanical failures. Nickel-rich layered oxides, such as NCM622, are promising cathode materials for lithium batteries, but chemo-mechanical failures hinder their practical application. Now the solid-state synthesis of NCM622 has been studied using multiscale in situ techniques, and kinetic competition between precursor decomposition and lithiation has been observed to lead to spatially heterogeneous intermediates and the formation of defects that are detrimental to cycling.

Asymmetric dearomatization catalysed by chiral Brønsted acids via activation of ynamides

Chiral Brønsted acid-catalysed asymmetric synthesis has received tremendous interest over the past decades, and numerous efficient synthetic methods have been developed based on this approach. However, the use of chiral Brønsted acids in these reactions is mostly limited to the activation of imine and carbonyl moieties, and the direct activation of carbon–carbon triple bonds has so far not been invoked. Here we show that chiral Brønsted acids enable the catalytic asymmetric dearomatization reactions of naphthol-, phenol- and pyrrole-ynamides by the direct activation of alkynes. This method leads to the practical and atom-economic construction of various valuable spirocyclic enones and 2H-pyrroles that bear a chiral quaternary carbon stereocentre in generally good-to-excellent yields with excellent chemo-, regio- and enantioselectivities. The activation mode of chiral Brønsted acid catalysis revealed in this study is expected to be of broad utility in catalytic asymmetric reactions that involve ynamides and the related heteroatom-substituted alkynes. Chiral Brønsted acid catalysis is mostly limited to the activation of imine and carbonyl moieties. Now, by direct activation of alkynes, chiral Brønsted acids have been used to enable the catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of naphthol-, phenol- and pyrrole-ynamides for the construction of various spirocyclic enones and 2H-pyrroles bearing a chiral quaternary carbon stereocentre.

Super-resolution imaging of non-fluorescent reactions via competition

Super-resolved fluorescence microscopy techniques have enabled substantial advances in the chemical and biological sciences. However, they can only interrogate entities that fluoresce, and most chemical or biological processes do not involve fluorescent species. Here we report a competition-enabled imaging technique with super-resolution (COMPEITS) that enables quantitative super-resolution imaging of non-fluorescent processes. It is based on the incorporation of competition into a single-molecule fluorescence-detection scheme. We demonstrate COMPEITS by investigating a photoelectrocatalytic reaction; we map, with nanometre precision, a non-fluorescent surface reaction that is important for water decontamination on single photocatalyst particles. The subparticle-level quantitative information of reactant adsorption affinities unambiguously decouples size- and shape-scaling laws on specific particle facets and uncovers a surprising biphasic shape dependence, leading to catalyst design principles for optimal reactant adsorption efficacy. With its ability to provide spatially resolved information on the behaviours of unlabelled, non-fluorescent entities under operando conditions, COMPEITS could interrogate a variety of surface processes in fields ranging from heterogeneous catalysis and materials engineering to nanotechnology and energy sciences. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques can interrogate entities that fluoresce; however, most chemical or biological processes do not involve fluorescent species. Now, the incorporation of a competitive reaction into a single-molecule fluorescence detection scheme has been shown to enable quantitative super-resolution imaging of non-fluorescent reactions.

Closed-loop recycling of plastics enabled by dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds

Recycled plastics are low-value commodities due to residual impurities and the degradation of polymer properties with each cycle of re-use. Plastics that undergo reversible polymerization allow high-value monomers to be recovered and re-manufactured into pristine materials, which should incentivize recycling in closed-loop life cycles. However, monomer recovery is often costly, incompatible with complex mixtures and energy-intensive. Here, we show that next-generation plastics—polymerized using dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds—allow the recovery of monomers from common additives, even in mixed waste streams. Poly(diketoenamine)s ‘click’ together from a wide variety of triketones and aromatic or aliphatic amines, yielding only water as a by-product. Recovered monomers can be re-manufactured into the same polymer formulation, without loss of performance, as well as other polymer formulations with differentiated properties. The ease with which poly(diketoenamine)s can be manufactured, used, recycled and re-used—without losing value—points to new directions in designing sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact. It is difficult to recover materials for re-manufacturing and re-use from plastics that are compounded with colourants, fillers and flame retardants. Now, it has been shown that alternative plastics based on dynamic covalent poly(diketoenamine)s depolymerize in strong aqueous acids and enable triketone and amine monomers to be isolated and upcycled into new plastics.

Enzyme-free synthesis of natural phospholipids in water

All living organisms synthesize phospholipids as the primary constituent of their cell membranes. Enzymatic synthesis of diacylphospholipids requires preexisting membrane-embedded enzymes. This limitation has led to models of early life in which the first cells used simpler types of membrane building blocks and has hampered integration of phospholipid synthesis into artificial cells. Here we demonstrate an enzyme-free synthesis of natural diacylphospholipids by transacylation in water, which is enabled by a combination of ion pairing and self-assembly between lysophospholipids and acyl donors. A variety of membrane-forming cellular phospholipids have been obtained in high yields. Membrane formation takes place in water from natural alkaline sources such as soda lakes and hydrothermal oceanic vents. When formed vesicles are transferred to more acidic solutions, electrochemical proton gradients are spontaneously established and maintained. This high-yielding non-enzymatic synthesis of natural phospholipids in water opens up new routes for lipid synthesis in artificial cells and sheds light on the origin and evolution of cellular membranes. It is unclear how phospholipid membranes formed on the early Earth, as modern cells synthesize the phospholipid constituents of their membranes enzymatically. Now, a combination of ion pairing and self-assembly has enabled transacylation of lysophospholipids with acyl donors in water, affording a variety of membrane-forming natural diacylphospholipids in high yields.

Enantioselective photoinduced cyclodimerization of a prochiral anthracene derivative adsorbed on helical metal nanostructures

The generation of molecular chirality in the absence of any molecular chiral inductor is challenging and of fundamental interest for developing a better understanding of homochirality. Here, we show the manipulation of molecular chirality through control of the handedness of helical metal nanostructures (referred to as nanohelices) that are produced by glancing angle deposition onto a substrate that rotates in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. A prochiral molecule, 2-anthracenecarboxylic acid, is stereoselectively adsorbed on the metal nanohelices as enantiomorphous anti-head-to-head dimers. The dimers show either Si–Si or Re–Re facial stacking depending on the handedness of the nanohelices, which results in a specific enantiopreference during their photoinduced cyclodimerization: a left-handed nanohelix leads to the formation of (+)-cyclodimers, whereas a right-handed one gives (–)-cyclodimers. Density functional theory calculations, in good agreement with the experimental results, point to the enantioselectivity mainly arising from the selective spatial matching of either Si–Si or Re–Re facial stacking at the helical surface; it may also be influenced by chiroplasmonic effects. The photoinduced dimerization of a prochiral anthracenecarboxylic acid occurs in an enantioselective fashion when the molecules are adsorbed on helical metal nanostructures. This enantiopreference arises mostly from the helicity of the silver and copper substrates—prepared using shear forces during the deposition process—and may also be influenced by chiroplasmonic effects.

Biosynthesis and characterization of fuscimiditide, an aspartimidylated graspetide

Microviridins and other ω-ester-linked peptides, collectively known as graspetides, are characterized by side-chain–side-chain linkages installed by ATP-grasp enzymes. Here we report the discovery of a family of graspetides, the gene clusters of which also encode an O-methyltransferase with homology to the protein repair catalyst protein l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase. Using heterologous expression, we produced fuscimiditide, a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP). NMR analysis of fuscimiditide revealed that the peptide contains two ester cross-links forming a stem–loop macrocycle. Furthermore, an unusually stable aspartimide moiety is found within the loop macrocycle. We fully reconstituted fuscimiditide biosynthesis in vitro including formation of the ester and aspartimide moieties. The aspartimide moiety embedded in fuscimiditide hydrolyses regioselectively to isoaspartate. Surprisingly, this isoaspartate-containing peptide is also a substrate for the l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase homologue, thus driving any hydrolysis products back to the aspartimide form. Whereas an aspartimide is often considered a nuisance product in protein formulations, our data suggest that some RiPPs have aspartimide residues intentionally installed via enzymatic activity. The biosynthesis of fuscimiditide, a ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified peptide, has now been reported. Heterologous expression and analysis of fuscimiditide showed it contained two side-chain–side-chain ester linkages and an aspartimide in its backbone. The aspartimide moiety is unexpectedly stable, suggesting this structure is the intended natural product.

Fast CO2 hydration kinetics impair heterogeneous but improve enzymatic CO2 reduction catalysis

The performance of heterogeneous catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction suffers from unwanted side reactions and kinetic inefficiencies at the required large overpotential. However, immobilized CO2 reduction enzymes—such as formate dehydrogenase—can operate with high turnover and selectivity at a minimal overpotential and are therefore ‘ideal’ model catalysts. Here, through the co-immobilization of carbonic anhydrase, we study the effect of CO2 hydration on the local environment and performance of a range of disparate CO2 reduction systems from enzymatic (formate dehydrogenase) to heterogeneous systems. We show that the co-immobilization of carbonic anhydrase increases the kinetics of CO2 hydration at the electrode. This benefits enzymatic CO2 reduction—despite the decrease in CO2 concentration—due to a reduction in local pH change, whereas it is detrimental to heterogeneous catalysis (on Au) because the system is unable to suppress the H2 evolution side reaction. Understanding the role of CO2 hydration kinetics within the local environment on the performance of electrocatalyst systems provides important insights for the development of next-generation synthetic CO2 reduction catalysts. Carbonic anhydrase enzymatically catalyses CO2 hydration, and its effect on enzymatic and heterogeneous CO2 reduction has now been studied. Through the co-immobilization of carbonic anhydrase, it has been shown that faster CO2 hydration kinetics are beneficial for enzymatic catalysis (using formate dehydrogenase) but detrimental for heterogeneous catalysts, such as gold.

A C–H activation-based enantioselective synthesis of lower carbo[n]helicenes

The three-dimensional structure of carbohelicenes has fascinated generations of molecular chemists and has been exploited in a wide range of applications. Their strong circularly polarized luminescence has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to promising applications in new optical materials. Although the enantioselective synthesis of fused carbo- and heterohelicenes has been achieved, a direct catalytic enantioselective method allowing the synthesis of lower, non-fused carbo[n]helicenes (n = 4–6) is still lacking. We report here that Pd-catalysed enantioselective C–H arylation in the presence of a unique bifunctional phosphine-carboxylate ligand provides a simple and general access to these lower carbo[n]helicenes. Computational mechanistic studies indicate that both the C–H activation and reductive elimination steps contribute to the overall enantioselectivity. The observed enantio-induction seems to arise from a combination of non-covalent interactions and steric repulsion between the substrate and ligand during the two key reductive elimination steps. The photophysical and chiroptical properties of the synthesized scalemic [n]helicenes have been systematically studied. A simple and general enantioselective method for the synthesis of non-fused lower carbo[n]helicenes (n = 4–6) is reported. The helicene scaffold is constructed with high enantioselectivity by Pd0-catalysed C–H arylation with aryl bromides. A bifunctional ligand provides a precise chiral environment that allows fine control of the enantioselectivity.

Towards simple kinetic models of functional dynamics for a kinase subfamily

Kinases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in the regulation of critical cellular pathways. However, in silico modelling of the conformational ensembles of these enzymes is difficult due to inherent limitations and the cost of computational approaches. Recent algorithmic advances combined with homology modelling and parallel simulations have enabled researchers to address this computational sampling bottleneck. Here, we present the results of molecular dynamics studies for seven Src family kinase (SFK) members: Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Fgr, Yes and Blk. We present a sequence invariant extension to Markov state models, which allows us to quantitatively compare the structural ensembles of the seven kinases. Our findings indicate that in the absence of their regulatory partners, SFK members have similar in silico dynamics with active state populations ranging from 4 to 40% and activation timescales in the hundreds of microseconds. Furthermore, we observe several potentially druggable intermediate states, including a pocket next to the adenosine triphosphate binding site that could potentially be targeted via a small-molecule inhibitor. Molecular dynamics simulations for seven members of the Src kinase family have now revealed a conserved step-wise deactivation process, potentially druggable intermediate states, and quantitatively similar thermodynamics and kinetics across the entire family.

Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation under an ambient atmosphere using a porous coordination polymer with bridging dinitrogen anions

The design of highly electron-active and stable heterogeneous catalysts for the ambient nitrogen reduction reaction is challenging due to the inertness of the N2 molecule. Here, we report the synthesis of a zinc-based coordination polymer that features bridging dinitrogen anionic ligands, {[Zn(L)(N2)0.5(TCNQ–TCNQ)0.5]·(TCNQ)0.5}n (L is tetra(isoquinolin-6-yl)tetrathiafulvalene and TCNQ is tetracyanoquinodimethane), and show that it is an efficient photocatalyst for nitrogen fixation under an ambient atmosphere. It exhibits an ammonia conversion rate of 140 μmol g−1 h−1 and functions well also with unpurified air as the feeding gas. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the active [Zn2+–(N≡N)−–Zn2+] sites can promote the formation of NH3 and the detachment of the NH3 formed creates unsaturated [Zn2+···Zn+] intermediates, which in turn can be refilled by external N2 sequestration and fast intermolecular electron migration. The [Zn2+···Zn+] intermediates stabilized by the sandwiched cage-like donor–acceptor–donor framework can sustain continuous catalytic cycles. This work presents an example of a molecular active site embedded within a coordination polymer for nitrogen fixation under mild conditions. The nitrogen reduction reaction is an extremely valuable but energy-intensive process. Now, a coordination polymer based on a [Zn–N2–Zn] unit has been shown to promote the formation of ammonia under ambient conditions by a photocatalytic reaction. The N2 moieties within the framework are reduced, creating unsaturated [Zn2+···Zn+] intermediates that are able to capture external N2 and sustain the cycle.

Organogel delivery vehicles for the stabilization of organolithium reagents

Organolithium reagents are a vital tool in modern organic chemistry, enabling the synthesis of carbon–carbon bonds. However, due to their high reactivity, low temperatures, inert atmospheres and strictly dried solvents are usually necessary for their use. Here we report an encapsulating method for the stabilization of sensitive organolithium reagents—PhLi, n-BuLi and s-BuLi—in a low-cost hexatriacontane (C36H74) organogel. The use of this technology is showcased in nucleophilic addition reactions under ambient conditions, low-temperature bromine–lithium exchange, ortho-lithiation and C–H functionalization. The gel substantially enhances organolithium stability, allows simple storage, handling and delivery, and enables reproducible reagent portioning. The use of gels as easily divided delivery vehicles for hazardous organometallics has the potential to transform this area of synthetic chemistry, making these powerful reactions safer and more accessible to non-specialist researchers, and enabling the more widespread use of these common synthetic methods. Organolithium compounds are important reagents but are often hazardous due to their high reactivity. Now, encapsulating organolithium reagents within a supramolecular organogel has been found to enhance their stability, facilitating their storage and handling under ambient conditions. The homogeneous gels can be easily subdivided and dosed into a wide range of synthetic reactions.

Second-generation DNA-templated macrocycle libraries for the discovery of bioactive small molecules

DNA-encoded libraries have emerged as a widely used resource for the discovery of bioactive small molecules, and offer substantial advantages compared&nbsp;with conventional small-molecule libraries. Here, we have developed and streamlined multiple fundamental aspects of DNA-encoded and DNA-templated library synthesis methodology, including computational identification and experimental validation of a 20 × 20 × 20 × 80 set of orthogonal codons, chemical and computational tools for enhancing the structural diversity and drug-likeness of library members, a highly efficient polymerase-mediated template library assembly strategy, and library isolation and purification methods. We have integrated these improved methods to produce a second-generation DNA-templated library of 256,000 small-molecule macrocycles with improved drug-like physical properties. In vitro selection of this library for insulin-degrading enzyme affinity resulted in novel insulin-degrading enzyme&nbsp;inhibitors, including one of unusual potency and novel macrocycle stereochemistry (IC50 = 40 nM). Collectively, these developments enable DNA-templated small-molecule libraries to serve as more powerful, accessible, streamlined and cost-effective tools for bioactive small-molecule discovery. A second-generation DNA-templated library of 256,000 small-molecule macrocycles has been developed. The improved method was created by streamlining and integrating multiple aspects of DNA-encoded and DNA-templated library synthesis methodology. In vitro selection of the macrocycle library against insulin-degrading enzyme enabled the discovery of potent inhibitors.

Iridium-catalysed arylation of C–H bonds enabled by oxidatively induced reductive elimination

Direct arylation of C–H bonds is in principle a powerful way of preparing value-added molecules that contain carbon–aryl fragments. Unfortunately, currently available synthetic methods are not sufficiently effective to be practical alternatives to conventional cross-coupling reactions. We propose that the main problem lies in the late portion of the catalytic cycle where reductive elimination gives the desired carbon–aryl bond. Accordingly, we have developed a strategy where the Ir(III) centre of the key intermediate is first oxidized to Ir(IV). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the barrier to reductive elimination is reduced by nearly 19 kcal mol–1 for this oxidized complex compared with that of its Ir(III) counterpart. Various experiments confirm this prediction, affording a new methodology capable of directly arylating C–H bonds at room temperature with a broad substrate scope and in good yields. This work highlights how the oxidation states of intermediates can be targeted deliberately to catalyse an otherwise impossible reaction. The direct arylation of C–H bonds is an attractive synthetic step, but the reductive elimination of an organometallic catalyst carrying the desired C–H and aryl functionalities has remained challenging. Now, this step has been achieved by first oxidizing the iridium centre of the catalyst, which facilitates the arylation of arene C–H bonds of a range of substrates.

Catalytic reductive desymmetrization of malonic esters

Desymmetrization of fully substituted carbons with a pair of enantiotopic functional groups is a practical strategy for the synthesis of quaternary stereocentres, as it divides the tasks of enantioselection and C−C bond formation. The use of disubstituted malonic esters as the substrate of desymmetrization is particularly attractive, given their easy and modular preparation, as well as the high synthetic values of the chiral monoester products. Here, we report that a dinuclear zinc complex with a tetradentate ligand can selectively hydrosilylate one of the carbonyls of malonic esters to give α-quaternary β-hydroxyesters, providing a promising alternative to the desymmetric hydrolysis using carboxylesterases. The asymmetric reduction features excellent enantiocontrol that can differentiate sterically similar substituents and high chemoselectivity towards the diester motif of substrates. Together with the versatile preparation of malonic ester substrates and post-reduction derivatization, the desymmetric reduction has enabled the synthesis of a diverse array of quaternary stereocentres with distinct structural features. The desymmetrization of easily accessible malonic esters represents an attractive approach towards the formation of chiral quaternary stereocentres, but is largely limited to enzymatic hydrolysis. Now, a zinc-catalysed asymmetric hydrosilylation reaction—that works with a broad scope of substrates—has been shown to reduce one of the esters to a primary alcohol with excellent enantiocontrol.

Title: 
Atomistic simulations of the Escherichia coli ribosome provide selection criteria for translationally active substrates

As genetic code expansion advances beyond l-α-amino acids to backbone modifications and new polymerization chemistries, delineating what substrates the ribosome can accommodate remains a challenge. The Escherichia coli ribosome tolerates non-l-α-amino acids in vitro, but few structural insights that explain how are available, and the boundary conditions for efficient bond formation are so far unknown. Here we determine a high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the E. coli ribosome containing α-amino acid monomers and use metadynamics simulations to define energy surface minima and understand incorporation efficiencies. Reactive monomers across diverse structural classes favour a conformational space where the aminoacyl-tRNA nucleophile is &lt;4 Å from the peptidyl-tRNA carbonyl with a Bürgi–Dunitz angle of 76–115°. Monomers with free energy minima that fall outside this conformational space do not react efficiently. This insight should accelerate the in vivo and in vitro ribosomal synthesis of sequence-defined, non-peptide heterooligomers. Genetic code expansion to incorporate non-α-amino acid monomers is limited by predictability of monomer reactivities in the context of the ribosome. Now the use of metadynamics simulations of pre-attack monomers in the ribosomal peptidyl transferase centre provides insight on whether an A-site monomer is likely to be reactive.

In situ visualization of loading-dependent water effects in a stable metal–organic framework

Competitive water adsorption can have a significant impact on metal–organic framework performance properties, ranging from occupying active sites in catalytic reactions to co-adsorbing at the most favourable adsorption sites in gas separation and storage applications. In this study, we investigate, for a metal–organic framework that is stable after moisture exposure, what are the reversible, loading-dependent structural changes that occur during water adsorption. Herein, a combination of in situ synchrotron powder and single-crystal diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and molecular modelling analysis was used to understand the important role of loading-dependent water effects in a water stable metal–organic framework. Through this analysis, insights into changes in crystallographic lattice parameters, water siting information and water-induced defect structure as a response to water loading were obtained. This work shows that, even in stable metal–organic frameworks that maintain their porosity and crystallinity after moisture exposure, important molecular-level structural changes can still occur during water adsorption due to guest–host interactions such as water-induced bond rearrangements. A stable zinc-based metal–organic framework known to retain its porosity and crystallinity after exposure to moisture has been shown to undergo structural changes at the molecular level on adsorbing water. This dynamic and reversible response to the presence of water, including the rearrangement of bonds, is suggested to be the reason for the hydrolytic stability of this particular metal–organic framework.

Full-dimensional quantum stereodynamics of the non-adiabatic quenching of OH(A2Σ+) by H2

The Born–Oppenheimer approximation, assuming separable nuclear and electronic motion, is widely adopted for characterizing chemical reactions in a single electronic state. However, the breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation is omnipresent in chemistry, and a detailed understanding of the non-adiabatic dynamics is still incomplete. Here we investigate the non-adiabatic quenching of electronically excited OH(A2Σ+) molecules by H2 molecules using full-dimensional quantum dynamics calculations for zero total nuclear angular momentum using a high-quality diabatic-potential-energy matrix. Good agreement with experimental observations is found for the OH(X2Π) ro-vibrational distribution, and the non-adiabatic dynamics are shown to be controlled by stereodynamics, namely the relative orientation of the two reactants. The uncovering of a major (in)elastic channel, neglected in a previous analysis but confirmed by a recent experiment, resolves a long-standing experiment–theory disagreement concerning the branching ratio of the two electronic quenching channels. The breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation is omnipresent in chemistry and detailed understanding of non-adiabatic dynamics is still incomplete. Now, the non-adiabatic quenching of electronically excited OH(A2Σ+) molecules by H2 has been investigated using full-dimensional quantum dynamics calculations and a high-quality diabatic-potential-energy matrix, providing insight into the branching ratio of the two electronic quenching channels.

Two-dimensional Na–Cl crystals of unconventional stoichiometries on graphene surface from dilute solution at ambient conditions

NaCl in a 1:1 stoichiometry is the only known stable form of the Na–Cl crystal under ambient conditions, and non-1:1 Na–Cl species can only form under extreme conditions, such as high pressures. Here we report the direct observation, under ambient conditions, of Na2Cl and Na3Cl as two-dimensional (2D) Na–Cl crystals, together with regular NaCl, on reduced graphene oxide membranes and on the surfaces of natural graphite powders from salt solutions far below the saturated concentration. Molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations suggest that this unconventional crystallization process originates from the cation–π interaction between the ions and the π-conjugated system in the graphitic surface, which promotes the ion–surface adsorption. The strong Na+–π interaction and charge transfer lead to stoichiometries with an excess of Na+. With unique electron and spin distributions and bonding, the resulting 2D crystals may have unusual electronic, magnetic, optical and mechanical properties. The common form of salt has a 1:1 ratio of Na+ and Cl−; however, species that deviate from this can be found under extreme conditions, such as high pressure. Now, as a result of cation–π interactions that promote ion–surface adsorption, Na2Cl and Na3Cl have been observed as two-dimensional crystals on graphene at ambient conditions.

Title: 
Endothermic singlet fission is hindered by excimer formation

Singlet fission is a process whereby two triplet excitons can be produced from one photon, potentially increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Endothermic singlet fission is desired for a maximum energy-conversion efficiency, and such systems have been considered to form an excimer-like state with multiexcitonic character prior to the appearance of triplets. However, the role of the excimer as an intermediate has, until now, been unclear. Here we show, using 5,12-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)tetracene in solution as a prototypical example, that, rather than acting as an intermediate, the excimer serves to trap excited states to the detriment of singlet-fission yield. We clearly demonstrate that singlet fission and its conjugate process, triplet–triplet annihilation, occur at a longer intermolecular distance than an excimer intermediate would impute. These results establish that an endothermic singlet-fission material must be designed to avoid excimer formation, thus allowing singlet fission to reach its full potential in enhancing photovoltaic energy conversion. Singlet fission may one day allow solar cells to produce two excited electrons with one photon. Now, by comparison of the time-resolved photoluminescence and sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation of a tetracene derivative, it has been shown that—contrary to previous reports—the excimer state is a trap, and not a necessary intermediate for singlet fission.

Vibrational coherences in manganese single-molecule magnets after ultrafast photoexcitation

Magnetic recording using femtosecond laser pulses has recently been achieved in some dielectric media, showing potential for ultrafast data storage applications. Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are metal complexes with two degenerate magnetic ground states and are promising for increasing storage density, but remain unexplored using ultrafast techniques. Here we have explored the dynamics occurring after photoexcitation of a trinuclear µ3-oxo-bridged Mn(iii)-based SMM, whose magnetic anisotropy is closely related to the Jahn–Teller distortion. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in solution reveals oscillations superimposed on the decay traces due to a vibrational wavepacket. Based on complementary measurements and calculations on the monomer Mn(acac)3, we conclude that the wavepacket motion in the trinuclear SMM is constrained along the Jahn–Teller axis due to the µ3-oxo and µ-oxime bridges. Our results provide new possibilities for optical control of the magnetization in SMMs on femtosecond timescales and open up new molecular-design challenges to control the wavepacket motion in the excited state of polynuclear transition-metal complexes. Controlling single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with ultrashort laser pulses could be key to future data storage devices, however, the photophysics of SMMs is complex. Now, using a monomer model system, it has been shown that optical excitation of Mn(iii)-SMMs leads to a modulation of the Jahn–Teller distortion, which is important for its magnetic anisotropy.

Temperature-jump solution X-ray scattering reveals distinct motions in a dynamic enzyme

Correlated motions of proteins are critical to function, but these features are difficult to resolve using traditional structure determination techniques. Time-resolved X-ray methods hold promise for addressing this challenge, but have relied on the exploitation of exotic protein photoactivity, and are therefore not generalizable. Temperature jumps, through thermal excitation of the solvent, have been utilized to study protein dynamics using spectroscopic techniques, but their implementation in X-ray scattering experiments has been limited. Here, we perform temperature-jump small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements on a dynamic enzyme, cyclophilin A, demonstrating that these experiments are able to capture functional intramolecular protein dynamics on the microsecond timescale. We show that cyclophilin A displays rich dynamics following a temperature jump, and use the resulting time-resolved signal to assess the kinetics of conformational changes. Two relaxation processes are resolved: a fast process is related to surface loop motions, and a slower process is related to motions in the core of the protein that are critical for catalytic turnover. Understanding how structural dynamics contribute to protein function is a longstanding challenge in structural biology. Now, time-resolved X-ray solution scattering following an infrared laser-induced temperature jump has been used to probe functional, intramolecular motions in the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A.

Bottom-up fabrication of a proteasome–nanopore that unravels and processes single proteins

The precise assembly and engineering of molecular machines capable of handling biomolecules play crucial roles in most single-molecule methods. In this work we use components from all three domains of life to fabricate an integrated multiprotein complex that controls the unfolding and threading of individual proteins across a nanopore. This 900 kDa multicomponent device was made in two steps. First, we designed a stable and low-noise β-barrel nanopore sensor by linking the transmembrane region of bacterial protective antigen to a mammalian proteasome activator. An archaeal 20S proteasome was then built into the artificial nanopore to control the unfolding and linearized transport of proteins across the nanopore. This multicomponent molecular machine opens the door to two approaches in single-molecule protein analysis, in which selected substrate proteins are unfolded, fed to into the proteasomal chamber and then addressed either as fragmented peptides or intact polypeptides. An integrated multiprotein nanopore has been fabricated using components from all three domains of life. This molecular machine opens the door to two approaches in single-molecule protein analysis, in which selected substrate proteins are unfolded, fed to into the proteasomal chamber and then processed either as fragmented peptides or intact polypeptides.

Signalling and differentiation in emulsion-based multi-compartmentalized in vitro gene circuits

Multicellularity enables the growth of complex life forms as it allows for the specialization of cell types, differentiation and large-scale spatial organization. In a similar way, modular construction of synthetic multicellular systems will lead to dynamic biomimetic materials that can respond to their environment in complex ways. To achieve this goal, artificial cellular communication and developmental programs still have to be established. Here, we create geometrically controlled spatial arrangements of emulsion-based artificial cellular compartments containing synthetic in vitro gene circuitry, separated by lipid bilayer membranes. We quantitatively determine the membrane pore-dependent response of the circuits to artificial morphogen gradients, which are established via diffusion from dedicated organizer cells. Utilizing different types of feedforward and feedback in vitro gene circuits, we then implement artificial signalling and differentiation processes, demonstrating the potential for the realization of complex spatiotemporal dynamics in artificial multicellular systems. Synthetic gene circuits encapsulated in lipid membrane compartments are often employed as artificial cell mimics, but these lack the complex behaviour of biological tissues. Now, spatial information based on chemical gradients has been used to engineer non-trivial dynamics such as signal propagation and differentiation in an artificial multicellular system.

Sulfone-containing covalent organic frameworks for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water

Nature uses organic molecules for light harvesting and photosynthesis, but most man-made water splitting catalysts are inorganic semiconductors. Organic photocatalysts, while attractive because of their synthetic tunability, tend to have low quantum efficiencies for water splitting. Here we present a crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) based on a benzo-bis(benzothiophene sulfone) moiety that shows a much higher activity for photochemical hydrogen evolution than its amorphous or semicrystalline counterparts. The COF is stable under long-term visible irradiation and shows steady photochemical hydrogen evolution with a sacrificial electron donor for at least 50 hours. We attribute the high quantum efficiency of fused-sulfone-COF to its crystallinity, its strong visible light absorption, and its wettable, hydrophilic 3.2 nm mesopores. These pores allow the framework to be dye-sensitized, leading to a further 61% enhancement in the hydrogen evolution rate up to 16.3 mmol g−1 h−1. The COF also retained its photocatalytic activity when cast as a thin film onto a support. The inherent synthetic tuneability of organic materials makes them attractive in photocatalysis, but they tend to have low quantum efficiencies for water splitting. A crystalline covalent organic framework featuring a benzo-bis(benzothiophene sulfone) moiety has now been shown to exhibit high activity for photochemical hydrogen evolution from water.

Liquid–liquid phase separation during amphiphilic self-assembly

The self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules in solution is a ubiquitous process in both natural and synthetic systems. The ability to effectively control the structure and properties of these systems is essential for tuning the quality of their functionality, yet the underlying mechanisms governing the transition from molecules to assemblies have not been fully resolved. Here we describe how amphiphilic self-assembly can be preceded by liquid–liquid phase separation. The assembly of a model block co-polymer system into vesicular structures was probed through a combination of liquid-phase electron microscopy, self-consistent field computations and Gibbs free energy calculations. This analysis shows the formation of polymer-rich liquid droplets that act as a precursor in the bottom-up formation of spherical micelles, which then evolve into vesicles. The liquid–liquid phase separation plays a role in determining the resulting vesicles’ structural properties, such as their size and membrane thickness, and the onset of kinetic traps during self-assembly. Amphiphilic self-assembly is ubiquitous both in nature and synthetic systems, yet the underlying mechanisms governing the transition from molecules to assemblies have not yet been fully resolved. Now, the role of liquid–liquid phase separation prior to the assembly process has been explored through the detailed analysis of a model block-copolymer system.

Electrochemically driven desaturation of carbonyl compounds

Electrochemical techniques have long been heralded for their innate sustainability as efficient methods to achieve redox reactions. Carbonyl desaturation, as a fundamental organic oxidation, is an oft-employed transformation to unlock adjacent reactivity through the formal removal of two hydrogen atoms. To date, the most reliable methods to achieve this seemingly trivial reaction rely on transition metals (Pd or Cu) or stoichiometric reagents based on I, Br, Se or S. Here we report an operationally simple pathway to access such structures from enol silanes and phosphates using electrons as the primary reagent. This electrochemically driven desaturation exhibits a broad scope across an array of carbonyl derivatives, is easily scalable (1–100 g) and can be predictably implemented into synthetic pathways using experimentally or computationally derived NMR shifts. Systematic comparisons to state-of-the-art techniques reveal that this method can uniquely desaturate a wide array of carbonyl groups. Mechanistic interrogation suggests a radical-based reaction pathway. Excising hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group—one of the most basic and widely employed transformations in organic synthesis—is traditionally achieved using metals and/or stoichiometric oxidants. Now, it has been shown that an electrochemically driven approach removes such requirements, resulting in a more sustainable and easily scalable method with wide substrate scope.

Audible sound-controlled spatiotemporal patterns in out-of-equilibrium systems

Naturally occurring spatiotemporal patterns typically have a predictable pattern design and are reproducible over several cycles. However, the patterns obtained from artificially designed out-of-equilibrium chemical oscillating networks (such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction for example) are unpredictable and difficult to control spatiotemporally, albeit reproducible over subsequent cycles. Here, we show that it is possible to generate reproducible spatiotemporal patterns in out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions and self-assembling systems in water in the presence of sound waves, which act as a guiding physical stimulus. Audible sound-induced liquid vibrations control the dissolution of atmospheric gases (such as O2 and CO2) in water to generate spatiotemporal chemical patterns in the bulk of the fluid, segregating the solution into spatiotemporal domains having different redox properties or pH values. It further helps us in the organization of transiently formed supramolecular aggregates in a predictable spatiotemporal manner. Patterns formed by artificial out-of-equilibrium chemical oscillating networks (such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction) are difficult to control with any precision. Now, it has been shown that low-intensity audible sound can be used to generate spatiotemporal patterns with a programmable distribution of redox- and pH-responsive chemical systems and supramolecular assemblies in solution.

Multihole water oxidation catalysis on haematite photoanodes revealed by operando spectroelectrochemistry and DFT

Water oxidation is the key kinetic bottleneck of photoelectrochemical devices for fuel synthesis. Despite advances in the identification of intermediates, elucidating the catalytic mechanism of this multi-redox reaction on metal–oxide photoanodes remains a significant experimental and theoretical challenge. Here, we report an experimental analysis of water oxidation kinetics on four widely studied metal oxides, focusing particularly on haematite. We observe that haematite is able to access a reaction mechanism that is third order in surface-hole density, which is assigned to equilibration between three surface holes and M(OH)–O–M(OH) sites. This reaction exhibits low activation energy (Ea ≈ 60 meV). Density functional theory is used to determine the energetics of charge accumulation and O–O bond formation on a model haematite (110) surface. The proposed mechanism shows parallels with the function of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II, and provides new insights into the mechanism of heterogeneous water oxidation on a metal oxide surface. The oxidation of water remains the kinetic bottleneck of solar-to-fuel synthesis. Now, spectroelectrochemical evidence together with density functional theory calculations show that charge accumulation determines the reaction mechanism on metal–oxide photoanodes. These insights reveal features that are common to the mechanisms of water oxidation carried out by other inorganic and biological systems.

Synthesis of a d1-titanium fluoride kagome lattice antiferromagnet

The kagome lattice, composed of a planar array of corner-sharing triangles, is one of the most geometrically frustrated lattices. The realization of a spin S = 1/2 kagome lattice antiferromagnet is of particular interest because it may host an exotic form of matter, a quantum spin liquid state, which shows long-range entanglement and no magnetic ordering down to 0 K. A few S = 1/2 kagome lattice antiferromagnets exist, typically based on Cu2+, d9 compounds, though they feature structural imperfections. Herein, we present the synthesis of (CH3NH3)2NaTi3F12, which comprises an S = 1/2 kagome layer that exhibits only one crystallographically distinct Ti3+, d1 site, and one type of bridging fluoride. A static positional disorder is proposed for the interlayer CH3NH3+. No structural phase transitions were observed from 1.8 K to 523 K. Despite its spin-freezing behaviour, other features—including its negative Curie–Weiss temperature and a lack of long-range ordering—imply that this compound is a highly frustrated magnet with unusual magnetic phase behaviours. The highly frustrated spin-1/2 kagome lattice antiferromagnet, predicted to exhibit unconventional magnetic behaviours, has remained difficult to synthesize without structural imperfections. Now, a d1-titanium fluoride kagome lattice antiferromagnet has been prepared in which there is only one crystallographically distinct Ti3+ site and one type of bridging fluoride, and it is shown to be a frustrated magnet with unusual magnetic properties.

Protein engineering through tandem transamidation

Semisynthetic proteins engineered to contain non-coded elements such as post-translational modifications (PTMs) represent a powerful class of tools for interrogating biological processes. Here, we introduce a one-pot, chemoenzymatic method that allows broad access to chemically modified proteins. The approach involves a tandem transamidation reaction cascade that integrates intein-mediated protein splicing with enzyme-mediated peptide ligation. We show that this approach can be used to introduce PTMs and biochemical probes into a range of proteins including Cas9 nuclease and the transcriptional regulator MeCP2, which causes Rett syndrome when mutated. The versatility of the approach is further illustrated through the chemical tailoring of histone proteins within a native chromatin setting. We expect our approach will extend the scope of semisynthesis in protein engineering. A method for engineering chemically modified proteins has now been developed using a chemoenzymatic cascade of sortase-mediated transpeptidation and protein trans-splicing. Using this one-pot approach enabled the generation of site-specifically modified proteins in vitro and in isolated cell nuclei.

Identification of autoinducing thiodepsipeptides from staphylococci enabled by native chemical ligation

Staphylococci secrete autoinducing peptides (AIPs) as signalling molecules to regulate population-wide behaviour. AIPs from non-Staphylococcus aureus staphylococci have received attention as potential antivirulence agents to inhibit quorum sensing and virulence gene expression in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. However, only a limited number of AIP structures from non-S. aureus staphylococci have been identified to date, as the minute amounts secreted in complex media render it difficult. Here, we report a method for the identification of AIPs by exploiting their thiolactone functionality for chemoselective trapping and enrichment of the compounds from the bacterial supernatant. Standard liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, guided by genome sequencing data, then readily provides the AIP identities. Using this approach, we confirm the identity of five known AIPs and identify the AIPs of eleven non-S. aureus species, and we expect that the method should be extendable to AIP-expressing Gram-positive bacteria beyond the Staphylococcus genus. Bacteria communicate through excretion of minute amounts of chemical signalling molecules that affect virulence, biofilm formation and colonization. In staphylococci, these molecules, called autoinducing peptides, are macrocyclic thiolactone-containing peptides. Now, a simple enrichment method, based on chemoselective capture on polymer beads, has been developed that enables the identification of previously unknown autoinducing peptides.

A short peptide synthon for liquid–liquid phase separation

Liquid–liquid phase separation of disordered proteins has emerged as a ubiquitous route to membraneless compartments in living cells, and similar coacervates may have played a role when the first cells formed. However, existing coacervates are typically made of multiple macromolecular components, and designing short peptide analogues capable of self-coacervation has proven difficult. Here we present a short peptide synthon for phase separation, made of only two dipeptide stickers linked via a flexible, hydrophilic spacer. These small-molecule compounds self-coacervate into micrometre-sized liquid droplets at sub-millimolar concentrations, which retain up to 75 wt% water. The design is general and we derive guidelines for the required sticker hydrophobicity and spacer polarity. To illustrate their potential as protocells, we create a disulfide-linked derivative that undergoes reversible compartmentalization controlled by redox chemistry. The resulting coacervates sequester and melt nucleic acids, and act as microreactors that catalyse two different anabolic reactions yielding molecules of increasing complexity. This provides a stepping stone for new coacervate-based protocells made of single peptide species. Liquid–liquid phase separation plays an important role in creating cellular compartments and protocells, but designing small-molecule models remains difficult. A peptide-based synthon for liquid–liquid phase separation consisting of two stickers and a flexible, polar spacer has now been presented. Condensates formed by these synthons can concentrate biomolecules and catalyse anabolic reactions.

Iron-catalysed synthesis and chemical recycling of telechelic 1,3-enchained oligocyclobutanes

Closed-loop recycling offers the opportunity to mitigate plastic waste through reversible polymer construction and deconstruction. Although examples of chemical recycling of polymers are known, few have been applied to materials derived from abundant commodity olefinic monomers, which are the building blocks of ubiquitous plastic resins. Here we describe a [2+2] cycloaddition/oligomerization of 1,3-butadiene to yield a previously unrealized telechelic microstructure of (1,n′-divinyl)oligocyclobutane. This material is thermally stable, has stereoregular segments arising from chain-end control, and exhibits high crystallinity even at low molecular weight. Exposure of the oligocyclobutane to vacuum in the presence of the pyridine(diimine) iron precatalyst used to synthesize it resulted in deoligomerization to generate pristine butadiene, demonstrating a rare example of closed-loop chemical recycling of an oligomeric material derived from a commodity hydrocarbon feedstock. Iron-catalysed [2+2] cycloaddition/oligomerization of neat butadiene affords (1,n′-divinyl)oligocyclobutane—a telechelic, crystalline material consisting of 1,3-enchained cyclobutyl units. This oligocyclobutane can be chemically recycled to pure butadiene using the same iron catalyst employed in its synthesis, demonstrating design principles for next-generation plastic materials that can be returned to pristine monomer.

Emissive spin-0 triplet-pairs are a direct product of triplet–triplet annihilation in pentacene single crystals and anthradithiophene films

Singlet fission and triplet–triplet annihilation represent two highly promising ways of increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Both processes are believed to be mediated by a biexcitonic triplet-pair state, 1(TT). Recently however, there has been debate over the role of 1(TT) in triplet–triplet annihilation. Here we use intensity-dependent, low-temperature photoluminescence measurements, combined with kinetic modelling, to show that distinct 1(TT) emission arises directly from triplet–triplet annihilation in high-quality pentacene single crystals and anthradithiophene (diF-TES-ADT) thin films. This work demonstrates that a real, emissive triplet-pair state acts as an intermediate in both singlet fission and triplet–triplet annihilation and that this is true for both endo- and exothermic singlet fission materials. The role of the biexcitonic triplet-pair state 1(TT) during triplet–triplet annihilation events in singlet-fission materials has been the subject of recent debate. Now, emissive 1(TT) states have been shown to be direct products of triplet–triplet annihilation in both endothermic and exothermic singlet-fission materials.

Melting of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites

Several organic–inorganic hybrid materials from the metal–organic framework (MOF) family have been shown to form stable liquids at high temperatures. Quenching then results in the formation of melt-quenched MOF glasses that retain the three-dimensional coordination bonding of the crystalline phase. These hybrid glasses have intriguing properties and could find practical applications, yet the melt-quench phenomenon has so far remained limited to a few MOF structures. Here we turn to hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites—which occupy a prominent position within materials chemistry owing to their functional properties such as ion transport, photoconductivity, ferroelectricity and multiferroicity—and show that a series of dicyanamide-based hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites undergo melting. Our combined experimental–computational approach demonstrates that, on quenching, they form glasses that largely retain their solid-state inorganic–organic connectivity. The resulting materials show very low thermal conductivities (~0.2 W m−1 K−1), moderate electrical conductivities (10−3–10−5 S m−1) and polymer-like thermomechanical properties. A series of dicyanamide-based hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite structures has been shown to melt at temperatures below 300 °C. On melt-quenching, they form glasses that possess coordination bonding and show very low thermal conductivities and moderate electrical conductivities as well as polymer-like thermomechanical properties.

Genetically encoded chemical crosslinking of RNA in vivo

Protein–RNA interactions regulate RNA fate and function, and defects can lead to various disorders. Such interactions have mainly been studied by nucleoside-based UV crosslinking methods, which lack broad in vivo compatibility and the ability to resolve specific amino acids. In this study we genetically encoded latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids into proteins to react with bound RNA by proximity-enabled reactivity and demonstrated genetically encoded chemical crosslinking of proteins with target RNA (GECX-RNA) in vivo. Applying GECX-RNA to the RNA chaperone Hfq in Escherichia coli identified target RNAs with amino acid specificity. Combining GECX-RNA with immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing of an N6-methyladenosine reader protein in mammalian cells allowed the in vivo identification of unknown N6-methyladenosine on RNA with single-nucleotide resolution throughout the transcriptome. GECX-RNA thus affords resolution at the nucleotide and amino acid level for interrogating protein–RNA interactions in vivo. It also enables the precise engineering of covalent linkages between a protein and RNA, which will inspire innovative solutions for RNA-related research and therapeutics. Protein–RNA interactions regulate RNA fate and function, and are generally non-covalent and reversible. Genetically introducing a latent bioreactive amino acid into a protein is now shown to enable the protein to covalently crosslink a bound RNA molecule in vivo. This method offers innovative avenues for developing protein–RNA research and applications.

Highly conducting single-molecule topological insulators based on mono- and di-radical cations

Single-molecule topological insulators are promising candidates as conducting wires over nanometre length scales. A key advantage is their ability to exhibit quasi-metallic transport, in contrast to conjugated molecular wires which typically exhibit a low conductance that decays as the wire length increases. Here, we study a family of oligophenylene-bridged bis(triarylamines) with tunable and stable mono- or di-radicaloid character. These wires can undergo one- and two-electron chemical oxidations to the corresponding mono-cation and di-cation, respectively. We show that the oxidized wires exhibit reversed conductance decay with increasing length, consistent with the expectation for Su–Schrieffer–Heeger-type one-dimensional topological insulators. The 2.6-nm-long di-cation reported here displays a conductance greater than 0.1G0, where G0 is the conductance quantum, a factor of 5,400 greater than the neutral form. The observed conductance–length relationship is similar between the mono-cation and di-cation series. Density functional theory calculations elucidate how the frontier orbitals and delocalization of radicals facilitate the observed non-classical quasi-metallic behaviour. Designing long and highly conducting molecular wires has been a great challenge for decades. It has now been shown that a singly oxidized 2.6-nm-long oligophenylene-bridged bis(triarylamine) can show a single-molecule junction conductance over 0.1G0.

Observation of robust energy transfer in the photosynthetic protein allophycocyanin using single-molecule pump–probe spectroscopy

Photosynthetic organisms convert sunlight to electricity with near unity quantum efficiency. Absorbed photoenergy transfers through a network of chromophores positioned within protein scaffolds, which fluctuate due to thermal motion. The resultant variation in the individual energy transfer steps has not yet been measured, and so how the efficiency is robust to this variation has not been determined. Here, we describe single-molecule pump–probe spectroscopy with facile spectral tuning and its application to the ultrafast dynamics of single allophycocyanin, a light-harvesting protein from cyanobacteria. We disentangled the energy transfer and energetic relaxation from nuclear motion using the spectral dependence of the dynamics. We observed an asymmetric distribution of timescales for energy transfer and a slower and more heterogeneous distribution of timescales for energetic relaxation, which was due to the impact of the protein environment. Collectively, these results suggest that energy transfer is robust to protein fluctuations, a prerequisite for efficient light harvesting. In photosynthesis, photoenergy transfers through chromophore-containing proteins, which exhibit thermal fluctuations that change the positions of the chromophores. Now the ultrafast dynamics in allophycocyanin—a cyanobacterial light-harvesting protein—have been measured using single-molecule pump–probe spectroscopy. The data show that energy transfer precedes protein-induced photophysical heterogeneity, ensuring that light harvesting is robust to the heterogeneity.

On-surface synthesis of disilabenzene-bridged covalent organic frameworks

Substituting carbon with silicon in organic molecules and materials has long been an attractive way to modify their electronic structure and properties. Silicon-doped graphene-based materials are known to exhibit exotic properties, yet conjugated organic materials with atomically precise Si substitution have remained difficult to prepare. Here we present the on-surface synthesis of one- and two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks whose backbones contain 1,4-disilabenzene (C4Si2) linkers. Silicon atoms were first deposited on a Au(111) surface, forming a AuSix film on annealing. The subsequent deposition and annealing of a bromo-substituted polyaromatic hydrocarbon precursor (triphenylene or pyrene) on this surface led to the formation of the C4Si2-bridged networks, which were characterized by a combination of high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy supported by density functional theory calculations. Each Si in a hexagonal C4Si2 ring was found to be covalently linked to one terminal Br atom. For the linear structure obtained with the pyrene-based precursor, the C4Si2 rings were converted into C4Si pentagonal siloles by further annealing. Incorporating silicon into organic molecules and materials leads to interesting changes in electronic structure and properties; silabenzenes are attractive species for this purpose, but their high reactivity in solution poses challenges. Now, 1D and 2D covalent organic frameworks featuring disilabenzene rings (C4Si2) as linkers have been prepared by reacting silicon atoms and polyaromatic hydrocarbon precursors on a Au(111) surface.

Low-temperature liquid platinum catalyst

Insights into metal–matrix interactions in atomically dispersed catalytic systems are necessary to exploit the true catalytic activity of isolated metal atoms. Distinct from catalytic atoms spatially separated but immobile in a solid matrix, here we demonstrate that a trace amount of platinum naturally dissolved in liquid gallium can drive a range of catalytic reactions with enhanced kinetics at low temperature (318 to 343 K). Molecular simulations provide evidence that the platinum atoms remain in a liquid state in the gallium matrix without atomic segregation and activate the surrounding gallium atoms for catalysis. When used for electrochemical methanol oxidation, the surface platinum atoms in the gallium–platinum system exhibit an activity of $${\sim {2.8} \times {10^7}\,{{{\mathrm{mA}}}}\,{{{{\mathrm{mg}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pt}}}}}^{ - 1}}},$$ three orders of magnitude higher than existing solid platinum catalysts. Such a liquid catalyst system, with a dynamic interface, sets a foundation for future exploration of high-throughput catalysis. The cost-effective use of platinum as a catalyst has led to an evolving set of systems ranging from nanoparticles to single atoms on a variety of solid supports. It has now been shown that the dissolution of platinum atoms in a liquid gallium matrix generates a liquid catalyst that functions at low temperature with high activity.

Title: 
A silicon–carbonyl complex stable at room temperature

Main-group-element compounds with energetically high-lying donor and low-lying acceptor orbitals are able to mimic chemical bonding motifs and reactivity patterns known in transition metal chemistry, including small-molecule activation and catalytic reactions. Monovalent group 13 compounds and divalent group 14 compounds, particularly silylenes, have been shown to be excellent candidates for this purpose. However, one of the most common reactions of transition metal complexes, the direct reaction with carbon monoxide and formation of room-temperature isolable carbonyl complexes, is virtually unknown in main-group-element chemistry. Here, we show the synthesis, single-crystal X-ray structure, and density functional theory computations of a room-temperature-stable silylene carbonyl complex [L(Br)Ga]2Si:–CO (L = HC[C(Me)N(2,6-iPr2-C6H3)]2), which was obtained by direct carbonylation of the electron-rich silylene intermediate [L(Br)Ga]2Si:. Furthermore, [L(Br)Ga]2Si:–CO reacts with H2 and PBr3 with bond activation, whereas the reaction with cyclohexyl isocyanide proceeds with CO substitution. Compounds of main-group elements rarely undergo direct carbonylation reactions. Now, an electron-rich silylene intermediate has been shown to readily react with CO to form a silylene carbonyl complex that is stable at room temperature. This complex engages in CO substitution as well as oxidative addition reactions.

Deep learning to design nuclear-targeting abiotic miniproteins

There are more amino acid permutations within a 40-residue sequence than atoms on Earth. This vast chemical search space hinders the use of human learning to design functional polymers. Here we show how machine learning enables the de novo design of abiotic nuclear-targeting miniproteins to traffic antisense oligomers to the nucleus of cells. We combined high-throughput experimentation with a directed evolution-inspired deep-learning approach in which the molecular structures of natural and unnatural residues are represented as topological fingerprints. The model is able to predict activities beyond the training dataset, and simultaneously deciphers and visualizes sequence–activity predictions. The predicted miniproteins, termed ‘Mach’, reach an average mass of 10 kDa, are more effective than any previously known variant in cells and can also deliver proteins into the cytosol. The Mach miniproteins are non-toxic and efficiently deliver antisense cargo in mice. These results demonstrate that deep learning can decipher design principles to generate highly active biomolecules that are unlikely to be discovered by empirical approaches. Machine learning has now been shown to enable the de novo design of abiotic nuclear-targeting miniproteins. To achieve this, high-throughput experimentation was combined with a directed evolution-inspired deep-learning approach in which the molecular structures of natural and unnatural residues are represented as topological fingerprints. The designed miniproteins, called Mach proteins, are non-toxic and can efficiently deliver antisense cargo in mice.

Stabilization of hexazine rings in potassium polynitride at high pressure

Polynitrogen molecules are attractive for high-energy-density materials due to energy stored in nitrogen–nitrogen bonds; however, it remains challenging to find energy-efficient synthetic routes and stabilization mechanisms for these compounds. Direct synthesis from molecular dinitrogen requires overcoming large activation barriers and the reaction products are prone to inherent inhomogeneity. Here we report the synthesis of planar N62− hexazine dianions, stabilized in K2N6, from potassium azide (KN3) on laser heating in a diamond anvil cell at pressures above 45 GPa. The resulting K2N6, which exhibits a metallic lustre, remains metastable down to 20 GPa. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy were used to identify this material, through good agreement with the theoretically predicted structural, vibrational and electronic properties for K2N6. The N62− rings characterized here are likely to be present in other high-energy-density materials stabilized by pressure. Under 30 GPa, an unusual N20.75−-containing compound with the formula K3(N2)4 was formed instead. The planar hexazine dianion ring (N62–), which had previously been predicted to exist, has now been synthesized from potassium azide (KN3) under laser heating in a diamond anvil cell above 45 GPa; it remains metastable down to 20 GPa. By contrast, at 30 GPa an unusual N2-containing compound with the formula K3(N2)4 was produced.

Title: 
A plausible metal-free ancestral analogue of the Krebs cycle composed entirely of α-ketoacids

Efforts to decipher the prebiotic roots of metabolic pathways have focused on recapitulating modern biological transformations, with metals typically serving in place of cofactors and enzymes. Here we show that the reaction of glyoxylate with pyruvate under mild aqueous conditions produces a series of α-ketoacid analogues of the reductive citric acid cycle without the need for metals or enzyme catalysts. The transformations proceed in the same sequence as the reverse Krebs cycle, resembling a protometabolic pathway, with glyoxylate acting as both the carbon source and reducing agent. Furthermore, the α-ketoacid analogues provide a natural route for the synthesis of amino acids by transamination with glycine, paralleling the extant metabolic mechanisms and obviating the need for metal-catalysed abiotic reductive aminations. This emerging sequence of prebiotic reactions could have set the stage for the advent of increasingly sophisticated pathways operating under catalytic control. Metal-catalysed prebiotic reactions have been proposed as forerunners of modern metabolism. Now, an abiotic pathway resembling the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle has been shown to proceed without metal catalysis. The reaction of glyoxylate and pyruvate produces a series of α-ketoacid tricarboxylic acid analogues, and provides a route to generate α-amino acids by transamination.

A catalytic alkene insertion approach to bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane bioisosteres

C(sp3)-rich bicyclic hydrocarbon scaffolds, as exemplified by bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes, play an increasingly high-profile role as saturated bioisosteres of benzenoids in medicinal chemistry and crop science. Substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) are emerging bicyclic hydrocarbon bioisosteres for ortho- and meta-substituted benzenes, but are difficult to access. Therefore, a general synthetic route to BCHs is needed if their potential as bioisosteres is to be realized. Here we describe a broadly applicable catalytic approach that delivers substituted BCHs by intermolecular coupling between olefins and bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl (BCB) ketones. The SmI2–catalysed process works for a wide range of electron-deficient alkenes and substituted BCB ketones, operates with SmI2 loadings as low as 5 mol% and is underpinned by a radical relay mechanism that is supported by density functional theory calculations. The product BCH ketones have been shown to be versatile synthetic intermediates through selective downstream manipulation and the expedient synthesis of a saturated hydrocarbon analogue of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial, phthalylsulfathiazole. Substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) are emerging bicyclic hydrocarbon bioisosteres for ortho- and meta-substituted benzenes, but are difficult to access. Now a SmI2-catalysed intermolecular coupling of bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl ketones and alkenes provides a general approach to access substituted BCHs, thus promoting their widespread use in medicinal chemistry and crop science.

Single helically folded aromatic oligoamides that mimic the charge surface of double-stranded B-DNA

Numerous essential biomolecular processes require the recognition of DNA surface features by proteins. Molecules mimicking these features could potentially act as decoys and interfere with pharmacologically or therapeutically relevant protein–DNA interactions. Although naturally occurring DNA-mimicking proteins have been described, synthetic tunable molecules that mimic the charge surface of double-stranded DNA are not known. Here, we report the design, synthesis and structural characterization of aromatic oligoamides that fold into single helical conformations and display a double helical array of negatively charged residues in positions that match the phosphate moieties in B-DNA. These molecules were able to inhibit several enzymes possessing non-sequence-selective DNA-binding properties, including topoisomerase 1 and HIV-1 integrase, presumably through specific foldamer–protein interactions, whereas sequence-selective enzymes were not inhibited. Such modular and synthetically accessible DNA mimics provide a versatile platform to design novel inhibitors of protein–DNA interactions. Molecules that mimic the charge surface of B-DNA could enable the inhibition of DNA processive enzymes. Now, helically folded aromatic oligoamide scaffolds have been synthesized that display anions at positions similar to that of B-DNA phosphates. These foldamer mimics can recognize some DNA binding proteins and inhibit enzymes such as HIV integrase and topoisomerase 1.

Palladium-catalysed construction of butafulvenes

Butafulvene is a constitutional isomer of benzene, comprising a cyclobutene skeleton bearing two exocyclic conjugated methylene units. As a result of the intrinsic high strain energy and anti-aromaticity, the preparation of butafulvene compounds has been a fundamental issue for the development of butafulvene chemistry. Here an efficient palladium-catalysed coupling protocol involving propargylic compounds has been developed, providing a solid and versatile strategy for the rapid assembly of symmetric butafulvene derivatives. Based on mechanistic studies, two complementary mechanisms, both involving palladium catalysis, have been confirmed. With the mechanism unveiled, the synthesis of non-symmetric butafulvenes has also been achieved. Advantages of this strategy include tolerance to a wide range of propargylic molecules, mild reaction conditions, simple catalytic systems and easy scalability. The synthetic potential of the products as platform molecules for cyclobutene derivatives has also been demonstrated. Butafulvene is a constitutional isomer of benzene, comprising a cyclobutene skeleton bearing two exocyclic conjugated methylene units. Strategies for the synthesis of butafulvene compounds are currently limited due to its intrinsic high strain energy and anti-aromaticity. Now, palladium-catalysed couplings have been developed for the rapid assembly of symmetric and non-symmetric anti-aromatic butafulvene derivatives.

Approaching sub-ppm-level asymmetric organocatalysis of a highly challenging and scalable carbon–carbon bond forming reaction

The chemical synthesis of organic molecules involves, at its very essence, the creation of carbon–carbon bonds. In this context, the aldol reaction is among the most important synthetic methods, and a wide variety of catalytic and stereoselective versions have been reported. However, aldolizations yielding tertiary aldols, which result from the reaction of an enolate with a ketone, are challenging and only a few catalytic asymmetric Mukaiyama aldol reactions with ketones as electrophiles have been described. These methods typically require relatively high catalyst loadings, deliver substandard enantioselectivity or need special reagents or additives. We now report extremely potent catalysts that readily enable the reaction of silyl ketene acetals with a diverse set of ketones to furnish the corresponding tertiary aldol products in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Parts per million (ppm) levels of catalyst loadings can be routinely used and provide fast and quantitative product formation in high enantiopurity. In situ spectroscopic studies and acidity measurements suggest a silylium ion based, asymmetric counteranion-directed Lewis acid catalysis mechanism. Chiral tertiary aldols are encountered in a variety of biologically relevant molecules. Making these valuable compounds directly from unbiased ketones has proven to be extremely challenging. Now it has been shown that sub-ppm levels of in situ generated silylium-based organic Lewis acid catalysts can give quantitative product formation in very high enantiopurity through a Mukaiyama aldol reaction.

Electrochemical synthesis of propylene from carbon dioxide on copper nanocrystals

The conversion of carbon dioxide to value-added products using renewable electricity would potentially help to address current climate concerns. The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to propylene, a critical feedstock, requires multiple C–C coupling steps with the transfer of 18 electrons per propylene molecule, and hence is kinetically sluggish. Here we present the electrosynthesis of propylene from carbon dioxide on copper nanocrystals with a peak geometric current density of −5.5 mA cm−2. The metallic copper nanocrystals formed from CuCl precursor present preponderant Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets, likely to favour the adsorption of key *C1 and *C2 intermediates. Strikingly, the production rate of propylene drops substantially when carbon monoxide is used as the reactant. From the electrochemical reduction of isotope-labelled carbon dioxide mixed with carbon monoxide, we infer that the key step for propylene formation is probably the coupling between adsorbed/molecular carbon dioxide or carboxyl with the *C2 intermediates that are involved in the ethylene pathway. The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to propylene requires multiple C–C coupling steps and the transfer of 18 electrons, posing kinetic and thermodynamic barriers. Now the electrosynthesis of propylene from carbon dioxide using copper nanocrystals has been demonstrated, with analysis revealing that the key step for its formation is probably the coupling between carbon dioxide or carboxyl with intermediates involved in the ethylene pathway.

The role of uranium–arene bonding in H2O reduction catalysis

The reactivity of uranium compounds towards small molecules typically occurs through stoichiometric rather than catalytic processes. Examples of uranium catalysts reacting with water are particularly scarce, because stable uranyl groups form that preclude the recovery of the uranium compound. Recently, however, an arene-anchored, electron-rich uranium complex has been shown to facilitate the electrocatalytic formation of H2 from H2O. Here, we present the precise role of uranium–arene δ bonding in intermediates of the catalytic cycle, as well as details of the atypical two-electron oxidative addition of H2O to the trivalent uranium catalyst. Both aspects were explored by synthesizing mid- and high-valent uranium–oxo intermediates and by performing comparative studies with a structurally related complex that cannot engage in δ bonding. The redox activity of the arene anchor and a covalent δ-bonding interaction with the uranium ion during H2 formation were supported by density functional theory analysis. Detailed insight into this catalytic system may inspire the design of ligands for new uranium catalysts. An arene-anchored uranium(III) complex that facilitates the electrocatalytic formation of H2 from H2O has now been shown to involve redox-cooperativity between the uranium centre and its covalently bound mesitylene ligand. The oxidative addition of H2O to the uranium catalyst is a concerted two-electron reaction — atypical for f-block metals.

Mapping partial wave dynamics in scattering resonances by rotational de-excitation collisions

One of the most important parameters in a collision is the ‘miss distance’ or impact parameter, which in quantum mechanics is described by quantized partial waves. Usually, the collision outcome is the result of unavoidable averaging over many partial waves. Here we present a study of low-energy NO–He collisions that enables us to probe how individual partial waves evolve during the collision. By tuning the collision energies to scattering resonances between 0.4 and 6 cm−1, the initial conditions are characterized by a limited set of partial waves. By preparing NO in a rotationally excited state before the collision and by studying rotational de-excitation collisions, we were able to add one quantum of angular momentum to the system and trace how it evolves. Distinct fingerprints in the differential cross-sections yield a comprehensive picture of the partial wave dynamics during the scattering process. Exploiting the principle of detailed balance, we show that rotational de-excitation collisions probe time-reversed excitation processes with superior energy and angular resolution. Low-energy NO–He collisions have been studied and scattering resonances observed. By rotationally exciting NO before the collision, a controlled amount of angular momentum was added and its release in de-excitation collisions was monitored—additional quantum waves were imprinted in the angular distributions of the scattering products.

Title: 
Chiral lipid bilayers are enantioselectively permeable

Homochiral membrane bilayers organize biological functions in all domains of life. The membrane’s permeability—its key property—correlates with a molecule’s lipophilicity, but the role of the membrane’s rich and uniform stereochemistry as a permeability determinant is largely ignored in empirical and computational measurements. Here, we describe a new approach to measuring permeation using continuously generated microfluidic droplet interface bilayers (DIBs, generated at a rate of 480 per minute) and benchmark this system by monitoring fluorescent dye DIB permeation over time. Enantioselective permeation of alkyne-labelled amino acids (Ala, Val, Phe, Pro) and dipeptides through a chiral phospholipid bilayer was demonstrated using DIB transport measurements; the biological l enantiomers permeated faster than the d enantiomers (from 1.2-fold to 6-fold for Ala to Pro). Enantioselective permeation both poses a potentially unanticipated criterion for drug design and offers a kinetic mechanism for the abiotic emergence of homochirality via chiral transfer between sugars, amino acids and lipids. Droplet interface bilayer measurements have now shown that membranes formed from chiral phospholipid bilayers are enantioselectively permeable to chiral amino acids. The results show that membrane stereochemistry is necessary and sufficient to drive such enantioselective transport, presenting a new potential route to homochirality. These findings could also have implications for pharmacokinetics and drug design.

Highly reduced and protonated aqueous solutions of [P2W18O62]6− for on-demand hydrogen generation and energy storage

As our reliance on renewable energy sources grows, so too does our need to store this energy to mitigate against troughs in supply. Energy storage in batteries or by conversion to chemical fuels are the two most flexible and scalable options, but are normally considered mutually exclusive. Energy storage solutions that can act as both batteries and fuel generation devices (depending on the requirements of the user) could therefore revolutionize the uptake and use of renewably generated energy. Here, we present a polyoxoanion, [P2W18O62]6−, that can be reversibly reduced and protonated by 18 electrons/H+ per anion in aqueous solution, and that can act either as a high-performance redox flow battery electrolyte (giving a practical discharged energy density of 225 Wh l−1 with a theoretical energy density of more than 1,000 Wh l−1), or as a mediator in an electrolytic cell for the on-demand generation of hydrogen. The polyoxoanion [P2W18O62]6− has been shown to reversibly accept up to 18 electrons upon reduction in aqueous solution. The resulting highly reduced solution can then be used either for the on-demand generation of hydrogen over a catalyst bed, or as a high-energy-density electrolyte in a redox flow battery.

Copper-catalysed difluorocarbene transfer enables modular synthesis

The use of metal catalysts to produce and control the reactivity of carbenes has long offered a powerful approach to organic synthesis; however, difluorocarbene transfer catalysed by metal is an outlier and remains a substantial challenge. In that context, copper difluorocarbene chemistry has been elusive so far. Here we report the design, synthesis, characterization and reactivity of isolable copper(I) difluorocarbene complexes, which enable the development of a copper-catalysed difluorocarbene transfer reaction. The method offers a strategy for the modular synthesis of organofluorine compounds from simple and readily available components. This strategy facilitates a modular difluoroalkylation by coupling difluorocarbene with two inexpensive feedstocks, silyl enol ethers and allyl/propargyl bromides, in a one-pot reaction via copper catalysis, providing a diversity of difluoromethylene-containing products without laborious multistep synthesis. The approach enables access to various fluorinated skeletons of medicinal interest. Mechanistic and computational studies consistently reveal a mechanism involving nucleophilic addition to an electrophilic copper(I) difluorocarbene. Although several transition-metal carbene complexes have been isolated and used for catalytic carbene transfer reactions, few metal difluorocarbene complexes have been reported. Now, the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of isolable copper(I) difluorocarbene complexes has been reported, which has enabled the development of a copper-catalysed difluorocarbene transfer reaction to access fluorinated compounds from simple chemical feedstocks.

Cholesterol catalyses Aβ42 aggregation through a heterogeneous nucleation pathway in the presence of lipid membranes

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the aberrant aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide. Although increasing evidence implicates cholesterol in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, the detailed mechanistic link between this lipid molecule and the disease process remains to be fully established. To address this problem, we adopt a kinetics-based strategy that reveals a specific catalytic role of cholesterol in the aggregation of Aβ42 (the 42-residue form of the amyloid-β&nbsp;peptide). More specifically, we demonstrate that lipid membranes containing cholesterol promote Aβ42 aggregation by enhancing its primary nucleation rate&nbsp;by up to 20-fold through a heterogeneous nucleation pathway. We further show that this process occurs as a result of cooperativity in the interaction of multiple cholesterol molecules with Aβ42. These results identify a specific microscopic pathway by which cholesterol dramatically enhances the onset of Aβ42 aggregation, thereby helping rationalize the link between Alzheimer’s disease and the impairment of cholesterol homeostasis. Cholesterol embedded in lipid membranes strongly promotes the aggregation of Aβ42 that is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Now, a kinetic analysis has shown that the mechanism of action responsible for this effect involves the introduction of a heterogeneous nucleation pathway that enhances the primary nucleation rate of Aβ42 aggregation by up to 20-fold.

In vitro selection of macrocyclic peptide inhibitors containing cyclic γ2,4-amino acids targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease

γ-Amino acids can play important roles in the biological activities of natural products; however, the ribosomal incorporation of γ-amino acids into peptides is challenging. Here we report how a selection campaign employing a non-canonical peptide library containing cyclic γ2,4-amino acids resulted in the discovery of very potent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Two kinds of cyclic γ2,4-amino acids, cis-3-aminocyclobutane carboxylic acid (γ1) and (1R,3S)-3-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid (γ2), were ribosomally introduced into a library of thioether-macrocyclic peptides. One resultant potent Mpro inhibitor (half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 50 nM), GM4, comprising 13 residues with γ1 at the fourth position, manifests a 5.2 nM dissociation constant. An Mpro:GM4 complex crystal structure reveals the intact inhibitor spans the substrate binding cleft. The γ1 interacts with the S1′ catalytic subsite and contributes to a 12-fold increase in proteolytic stability compared to its alanine-substituted variant. Knowledge of interactions between GM4 and Mpro enabled production of a variant with a 5-fold increase in potency. In vitro screening of a ribosomally synthesized macrocyclic peptide library containing cyclic γ2,4-amino acids (cγAA) afforded the discovery of potent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). A co-crystal structure revealed the contribution of this cγAA to Mpro binding and the proteolytic stability of these macrocycles.

Spatial separation of triplet excitons drives endothermic singlet fission

Molecules that undergo singlet fission, converting singlet excitons into pairs of triplet excitons, have potential as photovoltaic materials. The possible advantages of endothermic singlet fission (enhanced use of photon energy and larger triplet energies for coupling with common absorbers) motivated us to assess the role of exciton delocalization in the activation of this process. Here we report the synthesis of a series of linear perylene oligomers that undergo endothermic singlet fission and have endothermicities in the range 5–10 kBT at room temperature in solution. We study these compounds using transient spectroscopy and modelling to unravel the singlet and triplet dynamics. We show that the minimal number of coupled chromophores needed to undergo endothermic singlet fission is three, which provides sufficient statistical space for triplet excitons to separate and avoid annihilation—and a subsequent fast return to the singlet state. Our data additionally suggest that torsional motion of chromophores about the molecular axis following triplet-pair separation contributes to the increase in entropy, thus lengthening the triplet lifetime in longer oligomers. Generating high-energy triplet excitons from singlet fission without excess energy loss is a critical goal for potential applications. Now it is shown that molecular chromophores that are connected covalently can harbour multiple long-lived and high-energy triplets—created from one photon—only if more than two chromophoric units are present and they have sufficient flexibility to isolate the excitations upon torsional motion.

Quasiclassical simulations based on cluster models reveal vibration-facilitated roaming in the isomerization of CO adsorbed on NaCl

The desire to better understand the quantum nature of isomerization led to recent experimental observations of the vibrationally induced isomerization of OC–NaCl(100) to CO–NaCl(100). To investigate the mechanism of this isomerization, we performed dynamics calculations using finite (CO–NaCl)n cluster models. We constructed new potential energy surfaces for CO–NaCl and CO–CO interactions using high-level ab initio data and report key properties of the bare CO–NaCl potential energy surface, which show much in common with the experiment. We investigated the isomerization dynamics using several cluster models and, in all cases, isomerization was seen for highly excited CO vibrational states, in agreement with experiments. A detailed examination of the reaction trajectories indicates that isomerization occurs when the distance between CO and NaCl is larger than the distance at the conventional isomerization saddle point, which is a strong indicator of ‘roaming’. Recent experiments reporting the isomerization of CO on a NaCl(100) surface—from C adsorbed to O adsorbed—represent a major challenge to simulate from first principles. Now, using dynamics calculations and (CO–NaCl)n cluster models that feature CO–CO interactions, it is found that isomerization occurs via a ‘roaming’ mechanism at a large distance from the NaCl(100) surface.

Single-atom gold oxo-clusters prepared in alkaline solutions catalyse the heterogeneous methanol self-coupling reactions

In an effort to obtain the maximum atom efficiency, research on heterogeneous single-atom catalysts has intensified recently. Anchoring organometallic homogeneous catalysts to surfaces creates issues with retaining mononuclearity and activity, while the several techniques developed to prepare atomically dispersed precious metals on oxide supports are usually complex. Here we report a facile one-pot synthesis of inorganometallic mononuclear gold complexes formed in alkaline solutions as robust and versatile single-atom gold catalysts. The complexes remain intact on impregnation onto supports or after drying in air to give a crystalline powder. They can be used to interrogate the nuclearity of the catalytically active gold site for reactions known to be catalysed by oxidized gold species. We show that the [Au1–Ox]– cluster directs the heterogeneous coupling of two methanol molecules to methyl formate and hydrogen with a 100% selectivity below 180 °C. The reaction is industrially important as well as the key step in methanol steam reforming on gold catalysts. Generating stable single-atom catalysts is far from straightforward and can involve complicated preparation procedures. Now, mononuclear gold oxo-clusters formed in alkaline solutions through a facile one-pot synthesis are shown to catalyse the heterogeneous methanol self-coupling reaction to methyl formate and hydrogen. The intrinsic activity is the same for both supported and unsupported gold catalysts.

Heteromultivalent peptide recognition by co-assembly of cyclodextrin and calixarene amphiphiles enables inhibition of amyloid fibrillation

Heteromultivalency, which involves the simultaneous interactions of more than one type of ligand with more than one type of receptor, is ubiquitous in living systems and provides a powerful strategy to improve the binding efficiency of heterotopic species such as proteins and membranes. However, the design and development of artificial heteromultivalent receptors is still challenging owing to tedious synthesis processes and the need for precise control over the spatial arrangement of the binding sites. Here, we have designed a heteromultivalent platform by co-assembling cyclodextrin and calixarene amphiphiles, so that two orthogonal, non-covalent binding sites are distributed on the surface of the co-assembly. Binding with model peptides shows a synergistic effect of the two receptors, (hetero)multivalency and self-adaptability. The co-assembly shows promise for inhibition of the fibrillation of amyloid-β peptides and the dissolution of amyloid-β fibrils, substantially reducing amyloid cytotoxicity. This self-assembled heteromultivalency concept is easily amenable to other ensembles and targets, so that versatile biomedical applications can be envisaged. Heteromultivalency, which involves the simultaneous interactions of more than one type of ligand with more than one type of receptor, is common in biological systems but challenging to engineer artificially. Now, a heteromultivalent platform prepared by co-assembling cyclodextrin and calixarene amphiphiles has shown self-adaptive peptide binding with high affinity. The platform was used to sequester amyloid β-peptides, reducing amyloid cytotoxicity.

Enhanced reactivity of fluorine with para-hydrogen in cold interstellar clouds by resonance-induced quantum tunnelling

Chemical reactions are important in the evolution of low-temperature interstellar clouds, where the quantum tunnelling effect becomes significant. The F + para-H2 → HF + H reaction, which has a significant barrier of 1.8 kcal mol−1, is an important source of HF in interstellar clouds; however, the dynamics of this quantum-tunnelling-induced reactivity at low temperature is unknown. Here, we show that this quantum tunnelling is caused by a post-barrier resonance state. Quantum-state-resolved crossed-beam scattering measurements reveal that this resonance state has a collision energy of ~5 meV and a lifetime of ~80 fs, which are in excellent agreement with a recent anion photoelectron spectroscopic study. Accurate quantum reactive scattering calculations on the new iCSZ-LWAL potential energy surfaces provides a detailed explanation of the experimental results. The reaction rate for this system was also theoretically determined accurately at temperatures as low as 1 K. The F + para-H2 → HF + H reaction is an important source of HF in interstellar clouds; however, its unusually high rate and its dynamics at low temperature are not fully understood. Now, quantum-state resolved crossed-beam scattering measurements and anion photoelectron spectroscopy have revealed that this reactivity is caused by a resonance-enhanced tunnelling effect involving a post-barrier resonance state.

Practical synthesis of the therapeutic leads tigilanol tiglate and its analogues

Tigilanol tiglate is a natural product diterpenoid in clinical trials for the treatment of a broad range of cancers. Its unprecedented protein kinase C isoform selectivity make it and its analogues exceptional leads for PKC-related clinical indications, which include human immunodeficiency virus and AIDS eradication, antigen-enhanced cancer immunotherapy, Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis. Currently, the only source of tigilanol tiglate is a rain forest tree, Fontainea picrosperma, whose limited number and restricted distribution (northeastern Australia) has prompted consideration of designed tree plantations to address supply needs. Here we report a practical laboratory synthesis of tigilanol tiglate that proceeds in 12 steps (12% overall yield, &gt;80% average yield per step) and can be used to sustainably supply tigilanol tiglate and its analogues, the latter otherwise inaccessible from the natural source. The success of this synthesis is based on a unique strategy for the installation of an oxidation pattern common to many biologically active tiglianes, daphnanes and their analogues. Tigilanol tiglate is a therapeutic lead for the treatment of a broad range of cancers. Now, it has been shown that tigilanol tiglate can be synthesized in a time and step economical fashion from phorbol—its naturally abundant biosynthetic precursor. This synthesis provides rapid access to analogues with unprecedented protein kinase C binding activity.

Superoxide dismutase activity enabled by a redox-active ligand rather than metal

Reactive oxygen species are integral to many physiological processes. Although their roles are still being elucidated, they seem to be linked to a variety of disorders and may represent promising drug targets. Mimics of superoxide dismutases, which catalyse the decomposition of O2•− to H2O2 and O2, have traditionally used redox-active metals, which are toxic outside of a tightly coordinating ligand. Purely organic antioxidants have also been investigated but generally require stoichiometric, rather than catalytic, doses. Here, we show that a complex of the redox-inactive metal zinc(ii) with a hexadentate ligand containing a redox-active quinol can catalytically degrade superoxide, as demonstrated by both reactivity assays and stopped-flow kinetics studies of direct reactions with O2•− and the zinc(ii) complex. The observed superoxide dismutase catalysis has an important advantage over previously reported work in that it is hastened, rather than impeded, by the presence of phosphate, the concentration of which is high under physiological conditions. Catalytic superoxide dismutase mimics typically involve manganese centres. Now, a complex based on redox-inactive zinc(ii) and a redox-active quinol ligand is found to catalytically degrade superoxide. The reaction, proposed to occur through oxidation of the ligand to a quinoxyl radical, is hastened rather than inhibited by the presence of phosphate.

Live cell PNA labelling enables erasable fluorescence imaging of membrane proteins

DNA nanotechnology is an emerging field that promises fascinating opportunities for the manipulation and imaging of proteins on a cell surface. The key to progress is the ability to create a nucleic acid–protein junction in the context of living cells. Here we report a covalent labelling reaction that installs a biostable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) tag. The reaction proceeds within minutes and is specific for proteins carrying a 2 kDa coiled-coil peptide tag. Once installed, the PNA label serves as a generic landing platform that enables the recruitment of fluorescent dyes via nucleic acid hybridization. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by recruiting different fluorophores, assembling multiple fluorophores for increased brightness and achieving reversible labelling by way of toehold-mediated strand displacement. Additionally, we show that labelling can be carried out using two different coiled-coil systems, with epidermal growth factor receptor and endothelin receptor type B, on both HEK293 and CHO cells. Finally, we apply the method to monitor internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor on CHO cells. A method for the covalent labelling of proteins by installing a biostable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) tag has now been developed. The PNA label serves as a generic landing platform that enables the recruitment of fluorescent dyes via nucleic acid hybridization and fluorophore removal by toehold-mediated strand displacement. Imaging of cell surface receptors, including internalized receptors, has been demonstrated using this approach.

A monodomain class II terpene cyclase assembles complex isoprenoid scaffolds

Class II terpene cyclases, such as oxidosqualene and squalene-hopene cyclases, catalyse some of the most complex polycyclization reactions. They minimally exhibit a β,γ-didomain architecture that has been evolutionarily repurposed in a wide range of terpene-processing enzymes and likely resulted from a fusion of unidentified monodomain proteins. Although single domain class I terpene cyclases have already been identified, the corresponding class II counterparts have not been previously reported. Here we present high-resolution X-ray structures of a monodomain class II cyclase, merosterolic acid synthase (MstE). With a minimalistic β-domain architecture, this cyanobacterial enzyme is able to construct four rings in cytotoxic meroterpenoids with a sterol-like topology. The structures with bound substrate, product, and inhibitor provide detailed snapshots of a cyclization mechanism largely governed by residues located in a noncanonical enzyme region. Our results complement the few known class II cyclase crystal structures, while also indicating that archaic monodomain cyclases might have already catalyzed complex reaction cascades. Class II terpene cyclases convert simple linear substrates into complex polycyclic compounds, which typically requires multiple protein domains. Now, a single-domain class II cyclase, a cyanobacterial merosterolic acid synthase, has been identified and characterized. High-resolution X-ray crystal structures provide detailed insights into how a minimalistic enzyme accomplishes this complex cyclization process.

Macrocyclic colibactin induces DNA double-strand breaks via copper-mediated oxidative cleavage

Colibactin is an assumed human gut bacterial genotoxin, whose biosynthesis is linked to the clb genomic island that has a widespread distribution in pathogenic and commensal human enterobacteria. Colibactin-producing gut microbes promote colon tumour formation and enhance the progression of colorectal cancer via cellular senescence and death induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); however, the chemical basis that contributes to the pathogenesis at the molecular level has not been fully characterized. Here, we report the discovery of colibactin-645, a macrocyclic colibactin metabolite that recapitulates the previously assumed genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Colibactin-645 shows strong DNA DSB activity in vitro and in human cell cultures via a unique copper-mediated oxidative mechanism. We also delineate a complete biosynthetic model for colibactin-645, which highlights a unique fate of the aminomalonate-building monomer in forming the C-terminal 5-hydroxy-4-oxazolecarboxylic acid moiety through the activities of both the polyketide synthase ClbO and the amidase ClbL. This work thus provides a molecular basis for colibactin’s DNA DSB activity and facilitates further mechanistic study of colibactin-related colorectal cancer incidence and prevention. Colibactin is produced by human enterobacteria and assumed to be a gut bacterial genotoxin. Now, colibactin-645 has been identified as a macrocyclic colibactin metabolite that contains a C-terminal 5-hydroxy-4-oxazolecarboxylic acid moiety and induces DNA double-strand breaks in vitro and in human cell cultures via a unique copper-mediated oxidative mechanism.

Achieving spin-triplet exciton transfer between silicon and molecular acceptors for photon upconversion

Inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals interfaced with spin-triplet exciton-accepting organic molecules have emerged as promising materials for converting incoherent long-wavelength light into the visible range. However, these materials to date have made exclusive use of nanocrystals containing toxic elements, precluding their use in biological or environmentally sensitive applications. Here, we address this challenge by chemically functionalizing non-toxic silicon nanocrystals with triplet-accepting anthracene ligands. Photoexciting these structures drives spin-triplet exciton transfer from silicon to anthracene through a single 15 ns Dexter energy transfer step with a nearly 50% yield. When paired with 9,10-diphenylanthracene emitters, these particles readily upconvert 488–640 nm photons to 425 nm violet light with efficiencies as high as 7 ± 0.9% and can be readily incorporated into aqueous micelles for biological use. Our demonstration of spin-triplet exciton transfer from silicon to molecular triplet acceptors can critically enable new technologies for solar energy conversion, quantum information and near-infrared driven photocatalysis. Quantum dots functionalized with energy-accepting dyes hold promise for converting low-energy photons into higher-energy visible light for bioimaging, catalysis and solar energy harvesting. Now, it has been shown that non-toxic silicon quantum dots can be used in these systems; the transfer of spin-triplet excitons to molecules at their surface has been observed.

Isolation and characterization of diazoolefins

Diazoolefins tend to be highly reactive compounds that rapidly lose dinitrogen. So far, most experimental evidence for diazoolefins is indirect, via trapping experiments. Here we show that diazoolefins are observed to form in reactions of N-heterocyclic olefins with nitrous oxide. The products benefit from resonance stabilization, which enables isolation on a preparative scale, and comprehensive characterization, which includes crystallographic analyses. N-heterocyclic diazoolefins show a strong ylidic character, with a high charge density at the carbon atom next to the diazo group. Despite the presence of terminal N2 groups, N-heterocyclic diazoolefins display a good thermal stability, which surpasses that observed for most diazoalkanes. N-heterocyclic diazoolefins can bind transition and main group metal complexes without the liberation of dinitrogen, and spectroscopic data show that they are strong electron donors. They can also undergo reactions that involve the N2 group, as evidenced by cycloaddition reactions. Diazoolefins tend to be highly reactive compounds, and thus experimental evidence of these species is currently limited. Now, the reactivity and coordination chemistry of N-heterocyclic diazoolefins has been described. Diazoolefins are observed to form in reactions of N-heterocyclic olefins with nitrous oxide. The products benefit from resonance stabilization, enabling isolation on a preparative scale and comprehensive characterization.

An efficient, step-economical strategy for the design of functional metalloproteins

The bottom-up design and construction of functional metalloproteins remains a formidable task in biomolecular design. Although numerous strategies have been used to create new metalloproteins, pre-existing knowledge of the tertiary and quaternary protein structure is often required to generate suitable platforms for robust metal coordination and activity. Here we report an alternative and easily implemented approach (metal active sites by covalent tethering or MASCoT) in which folded protein building blocks are linked by a single disulfide bond to create diverse metal coordination environments within evolutionarily naive protein–protein interfaces. Metalloproteins generated using this strategy uniformly bind a wide array of first-row transition metal ions (MnII, FeII, CoII, NiII, CuII, ZnII and vanadyl) with physiologically relevant thermodynamic affinities (dissociation constants ranging from 700 nM for MnII to 50 fM for CuII). MASCoT readily affords coordinatively unsaturated metal centres—including a penta-His-coordinated non-haem Fe site—and well-defined binding pockets that can accommodate modifications and enable coordination of exogenous ligands such as nitric oxide to the interfacial metal centre. A concise strategy for engineering functional, supramolecular protein complexes has now been developed based on single-mutation-mediated covalent tethering. Metalloproteins designed with this method can sustain large alterations to the metal coordination environment, bind small molecules, exhibit reversible redox activity and sustain large alterations to the protein structure.

The effect of solvation on electron capture revealed using anion two-dimensional photoelectron spectroscopy

The reaction of low-energy electrons with neutral molecules to form anions plays an important role in chemistry, being involved in, for example, various biological and astrochemical processes. However, key aspects of electron–molecule interactions, such as the effect of incremental solvation on the initially excited electronic resonances, remain poorly understood. Here two-dimensional photoelectron spectroscopy of anionic anthracene and nitrogen-substituted derivatives—solvated by up to five water molecules—reveals that for an incoming electron, resonances red-shift with increasing hydration; but for the anion, the excitation energies of the resonances remain essentially the same. These complementary points of view show that the observed onset of enhanced anion formation for a specific cluster size is mediated by a bound excited state of the anion. Our findings suggest that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be more efficient at electron capture than previously predicted with important consequences for the ionization fraction in dense molecular clouds. Although electron-driven chemistry is ubiquitous, how molecular electron capture is altered by solvent remains poorly understood. Now, using anion two-dimensional photoelectron spectroscopy, it is shown that the presence of water molecules can enhance electron capture and that considering the mechanism from the perspective of the anion offers further understanding.

Native mass spectrometry-based metabolomics identifies metal-binding compounds

Although metals are essential for the molecular machineries of life, systematic methods for discovering metal–small molecule complexes from biological samples are limited. Here, we describe a two-step native electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry method, in which post-column pH adjustment and metal infusion are combined with ion identity molecular networking, a rule-based data analysis workflow. This method enabled the identification of metal-binding compounds in complex samples based on defined mass (m/z) offsets of ion species with the same chromatographic profiles. As this native electrospray metabolomics approach is suited to the use of any liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry system to explore the binding of any metal, this method has the potential to become an essential strategy for elucidating metal-binding molecules in biology. The systemic discovery of metal–small-molecule complexes from biological samples is a difficult challenge. Now, a method based on liquid chromatography and native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has been developed. The approach uses post-column pH adjustment and metal infusion combined with ion identity molecular networking, and a rule-based informatics workflow, to interrogate small-molecule–metal binding.

Low-valent tungsten redox catalysis enables controlled isomerization and carbonylative functionalization of alkenes

The controlled isomerization and functionalization of alkenes is a cornerstone achievement in organometallic catalysis that is now widely used throughout industry. In particular, the addition of CO and H2 to an alkene, also known as the oxo-process, is used in the production of linear aldehydes from crude alkene feedstocks. In these catalytic reactions, isomerization is governed by thermodynamics, giving rise to functionalization at the most stable alkylmetal species. Despite the ubiquitous industrial applications of tandem alkene isomerization/functionalization reactions, selective functionalization at internal positions has remained largely unexplored. Here we report that the simple W(0) precatalyst W(CO)6 catalyses the isomerization of alkenes to unactivated internal positions and subsequent hydrocarbonylation with CO. The six- to seven-coordinate geometry changes that are characteristic of the W(0)/W(II) redox cycle and the conformationally flexible directing group are key factors in allowing isomerization to take place over multiple positions and stop at a defined unactivated internal site that is primed for in situ functionalization. The regioselectivity of tandem isomerization/hydrocarbonylation reactions is typically dictated by thermodynamics and there are limitations on the isomerization of internal alkenes. Now, it has been shown that a low-valent-tungsten catalyst controls the isomerization of alkenes to classically challenging unactivated internal positions and, with the aid of a directing group, enables subsequent addition of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

Complex supramolecular interfacial tessellation through convergent multi-step reaction of a dissymmetric simple organic precursor

Interfacial supramolecular self-assembly represents a powerful tool for constructing regular and quasicrystalline materials. In particular, complex two-dimensional molecular tessellations, such as semi-regular Archimedean tilings with regular polygons, promise unique properties related to their nontrivial structures. However, their formation is challenging, because current methods are largely limited to the direct assembly of precursors, that is, where structure formation relies on molecular interactions without using chemical transformations. Here, we have chosen ethynyl-iodophenanthrene (which features dissymmetry in both geometry and reactivity) as a single starting precursor to generate the rare semi-regular (3.4.6.4) Archimedean tiling with long-range order on an atomically flat substrate through a multi-step reaction. Intriguingly, the individual chemical transformations converge to form a symmetric alkynyl–Ag–alkynyl complex as the new tecton in high yields. Using a combination of microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy tools, as well as computational modelling, we show that in situ generated catalytic Ag complexes mediate the tecton conversion. Complex interfacial supramolecular architectures promise unique physical and chemical properties, but are challenging to make. Now, it has been shown that a simple organic precursor can undergo a convergent multi-step on-surface transformation to give more complex building blocks that assemble into a semi-regular Archimedean tessellation with long-range order.

Emergence of light-driven protometabolism on recruitment of a photocatalytic cofactor by a self-replicator

Establishing how life can emerge from inanimate matter is among the grand challenges of contemporary science. Chemical systems that capture life’s essential characteristics—replication, metabolism and compartmentalization—offer a route to understanding this momentous process. The synthesis of life, whether based on canonical biomolecules or fully synthetic molecules, requires the functional integration of these three characteristics. Here we show how a system of fully synthetic self-replicating molecules, on recruiting a cofactor, acquires the ability to transform thiols in its environment into disulfide precursors from which the molecules can replicate. The binding of replicator and cofactor enhances the activity of the latter in oxidizing thiols into disulfides through photoredox catalysis and thereby accelerates replication by increasing the availability of the disulfide precursors. This positive feedback marks the emergence of light-driven protometabolism in a system that bears no resemblance to canonical biochemistry and constitutes a major step towards the highly challenging aim of creating a new and completely synthetic form of life. The integration of replication with metabolism represents a key step in the transition of chemistry into biology. Now, it has been shown that a self-replicator can recruit and activate two different photocatalytic cofactors, which then catalyse the synthesis of the precursors for the replicator.

Structure-specific amyloid precipitation in biofluids

The composition of soluble toxic protein aggregates formed in vivo is currently unknown in neurodegenerative diseases, due to their ultra-low concentration in human biofluids and their high degree of heterogeneity. Here we report a method to capture amyloid-containing aggregates in human biofluids in an unbiased way, a process we name amyloid precipitation. We use a structure-specific chemical dimer, a Y-shaped, bio-inspired small molecule with two capture groups, for amyloid precipitation to increase affinity. Our capture molecule for amyloid precipitation (CAP-1) consists of a derivative of Pittsburgh Compound B (dimer) to target the cross β-sheets of amyloids and a biotin moiety for surface immobilization. By coupling CAP-1 to magnetic beads, we demonstrate that we can target the amyloid structure of all protein aggregates present in human cerebrospinal fluid, isolate them for analysis and then characterize them using single-molecule fluorescence imaging and mass spectrometry. Amyloid precipitation enables unbiased determination of the molecular composition and structural features of the in vivo aggregates formed in neurodegenerative diseases. The composition of toxic protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases is difficult to determine. Now, a method has been developed that can capture amyloid-containing aggregates in human biofluids using a structure-specific chemical dimer. This method—known as amyloid precipitation—enables unbiased determination of the molecular composition and structural features of the in vivo aggregates.

Observation of resonances in the transition state region of the F + NH3 reaction using anion photoelectron spectroscopy

The transition state of a chemical reaction is a dividing surface on the reaction potential energy surface (PES) between reactants and products and is thus of fundamental interest in understanding chemical reactivity. The transient nature of the transition state presents challenges to its experimental characterization. Transition-state spectroscopy experiments based on negative-ion photodetachment can provide a direct probe of this region of the PES, revealing the detailed vibrational structure associated with the transition state. Here we study the F + NH3 → HF + NH2 reaction using slow photoelectron velocity-map imaging spectroscopy of cryogenically cooled FNH3− anions. Reduced-dimensionality quantum dynamical simulations performed on a global PES show excellent agreement with the experimental results, enabling the assignment of spectral structure. Our combined experimental–theoretical study reveals a manifold of vibrational Feshbach resonances in the product well of the F + NH3 PES. At higher energies, the spectra identify features attributed to resonances localized across the transition state and into the reactant complex that may impact the bimolecular reaction dynamics. The transition state, a transient species where bond transformation occurs, fundamentally controls reaction dynamics. This important species can be probed through the photodetachment of an anionic precursor, as has now been shown in the F + NH3 reaction. A combination of theory and experiment reveals resonances that span the transition state.

Nitrene-mediated intermolecular N–N coupling for efficient synthesis of hydrazides

N–N linkages are found in many natural compounds and endow fascinating structural and functional properties. In comparison to the myriad methods for the construction of C–N bonds, chemistry for N–N coupling, especially in an intermolecular fashion, remains underdeveloped. Here, we report a nitrene-mediated intermolecular N–N coupling of dioxazolones and arylamines under iridium or iron catalysis. These reactions offer a simple and efficient method for the synthesis of various hydrazides from readily available carboxylic acid and amine precursors. Although the Ir-catalysed conditions usually give higher N–N coupling yield than the Fe-catalysed conditions, the reactions of sterically more demanding dioxazolones derived from α-substituted carboxylic acids work much better under the Fe-catalysed conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that the nitrogen atom of Ir acyl nitrene intermediates has strong electrophilicity and can undergo nucleophilic attack with arylamines with the assistance of Cl···HN hydrogen bonding to form the N–N bond with high efficiency and chemoselectivity. Although many natural products and drug molecules contain N–N linkages, the chemistry of N–N coupling is somewhat underdeveloped. Now, a nitrene-mediated intermolecular N–N coupling of dioxazolones and arylamines that relies on iridium or iron catalysis has been developed. These reactions offer a simple and efficient method for the synthesis of hydrazides from readily available precursors.

Photogearing as a concept for translation of precise motions at the nanoscale

One of the major challenges for harnessing the true potential of functional nano-machinery is integrating and transmitting motion with great precision. Molecular gearing systems enable the integration of multiple motions in a correlated fashion to translate motions from one locality to another and to change their speed and direction. However, currently no powerful methods exist to implement active driving of gearing motions at the molecular scale. Here we present a light-fuelled molecular gearing system and demonstrate its superiority over passive thermally activated gearing. Translation of a 180° rotation into a 120° rotation is achieved while at the same time the direction of the rotation axis is shifted by 120°. Within such photogearing processes, precise motions at the nanoscale can be changed in direction and decelerated in a manner similar to macroscopic bevel-gear operations in an energy consuming way—a necessary prerequisite to employ gearing as an active component in future mechanical nano-systems. In a similar fashion to its macroscopic counterpart, molecular gearing is a correlated motion of intermeshed molecular fragments against one another. Now it has been shown that photogearing can be used to actively fuel molecular gearing motions with light and concomitantly shift the axis of rotation.

Single-cell mRNA cytometry via sequence-specific nanoparticle clustering and trapping

Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression creates a need for techniques that can characterize expression at the level of individual cells. This is particularly true for rare circulating tumour cells, in which subtyping and drug resistance are of intense interest. Here we describe a method for cell analysis—single-cell mRNA cytometry—that enables the isolation of rare cells from whole blood as a function of target mRNA sequences. This approach uses two classes of magnetic particles that are labelled to selectively hybridize with different regions of the target mRNA. Hybridization leads to the formation of large magnetic clusters that remain localized within the cells of interest, thereby enabling the cells to be magnetically separated. Targeting specific intracellular mRNAs enablescirculating tumour cells to be distinguished&nbsp;from normal haematopoietic cells. No polymerase chain reaction amplification is required to determine RNA expression levels and genotype at the single-cell level, and minimal cell manipulation is required. To demonstrate this approach we use single-cell mRNA cytometry to detect clinically important sequences in prostate cancer specimens. Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression creates a need for techniques that characterize expression at the level of individual cells. Now, a technique for characterizing mRNA expression has been developed. The technique uses the intracellular self-assembly of magnetic nanoparticles to quantitate RNA levels at the single-cell level.

Water oxidation electrocatalysis using ruthenium coordination oligomers adsorbed on multiwalled carbon nanotubes

Photoelectrochemical cells that utilize water as a source of electrons are one of the most attractive solutions for the replacement of fossil fuels by clean and sustainable solar fuels. To achieve this, heterogeneous water oxidation catalysis needs to be mastered and properly understood. The search continues for a catalyst that is stable at the surface of electro(photo)anodes and can efficiently perform this reaction at the desired neutral pH. Here, we show how oligomeric Ru complexes can be anchored on the surfaces of graphitic materials through CH–π interactions between the auxiliary ligands bonded to Ru and the hexagonal rings of the graphitic surfaces, providing control of their molecular coverage. These hybrid molecular materials behave as molecular electroanodes that catalyse water oxidation to dioxygen at pH 7 with high current densities. This strategy for the anchoring of molecular catalysts on graphitic surfaces can potentially be extended to other transition metals and other catalytic reactions. Efficient and stable water oxidation catalysts are important if photoelectrochemical cells are to be used to provide clean and sustainable solar fuels. A water oxidation catalyst that operates at neutral pH has now been developed that features ruthenium coordination oligomers anchored onto the surfaces of graphitic materials through CH–π interactions.

Manganese(i) complexes with metal-to-ligand charge transfer luminescence and photoreactivity

Precious metal complexes with the d6 valence electron configuration often exhibit luminescent metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states, which form the basis for many applications in lighting, sensing, solar cells and synthetic photochemistry. Iron(ii) has received much attention as a possible Earth-abundant alternative, but to date no iron(ii) complex has been reported to show MLCT emission upon continuous-wave excitation. Manganese(i) has the same electron configuration as that of iron(ii), but until now has typically been overlooked in the search for cheap MLCT luminophores. Here we report that isocyanide chelate ligands give access to air-stable manganese(i) complexes that exhibit MLCT luminescence in solution at room temperature. These compounds were successfully used as photosensitizers for energy- and electron-transfer reactions and were shown to promote the photoisomerization of trans-stilbene. The observable electron transfer photoreactivity occurred from the emissive MLCT state, whereas the triplet energy transfer photoreactivity originated from a ligand-centred 3π–π* state. Manganese(i) is isoelectronic to iron(ii) but has typically been overlooked as a cheap Earth-abundant metal for the development of 3d6 metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) emitters and photosensitizers. Now, using chelating isocyanide ligands, air-stable manganese(i) complexes have been obtained that exhibit MLCT luminescence, as well as energy- and electron-transfer photoreactivity.

Aldehyde-catalysed carboxylate exchange in α-amino acids with isotopically labelled CO2

The isotopic labelling of small molecules is integral to drug development and for understanding biochemical processes. The preparation of carbon-labelled α-amino acids remains difficult and time consuming, with established methods involving label incorporation at an early stage of synthesis. This explains the high cost and scarcity of C-labelled products and presents a major challenge in 11C applications (11C t1/2 = 20 min). Here we report that aldehydes catalyse the isotopic carboxylate exchange of native α-amino acids with *CO2 (* = 14, 13, 11). Proteinogenic α-amino acids and many non-natural variants containing diverse functional groups undergo labelling. The reaction probably proceeds via the trapping of *CO2 by imine-carboxylate intermediates to generate iminomalonates that are prone to monodecarboxylation. Tempering catalyst electrophilicity was key to preventing irreversible aldehyde consumption. The pre-generation of the imine carboxylate intermediate allows for the rapid and late-stage 11C-radiolabelling of α-amino acids in the presence of [11C]CO2. Carbon-labelled α-amino acids are valuable compounds in drug development and nuclear medicine, but are difficult and time consuming to prepare. Now, an aldehyde-catalysed method has been developed for the direct C1-labelling of α-amino acids using *CO2 (* = 14, 13, 11), providing access to many proteinogenic and non-natural labelled α-amino acids.

Filling of a water-free void explains the allosteric regulation of the β1-adrenergic receptor by cholesterol

Recent high-pressure NMR results indicate that the preactive conformation of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) harbours completely empty cavities of ~100 Å3 volume, which disappear in the active conformation of the receptor. Here we have localized these cavities using X-ray crystallography of xenon-derivatized β1AR crystals. One of the cavities is in direct contact with the cholesterol-binding pocket. Solution NMR shows that addition of the cholesterol analogue cholesteryl hemisuccinate impedes the formation of the active conformation of detergent-solubilized β1AR by blocking conserved G protein-coupled receptor microswitches, concomitant with an affinity reduction of both isoprenaline and G protein-mimicking nanobody Nb80 for β1AR detected by isothermal titration calorimetry. This wedge-like action explains the function of cholesterol as a negative allosteric modulator of β1AR. A detailed understanding of G protein-coupled receptor regulation by cholesterol by filling of a dry void and the easy scouting for such voids by xenon may provide new routes for the development of allosteric drugs. The β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) contains empty cavities in its preactive conformation, which disappear in the active one. Now, using X-ray crystallography of xenon-derivatized β1AR crystals, a cavity has been shown to be in contact with the cholesterol-binding pocket. Monitoring the binding of a cholesterol analogue in solution has explained the function of cholesterol as a negative allosteric modulator of β1AR.

OregonFluor enables quantitative intracellular paired agent imaging to assess drug target availability in live cells and tissues

Non-destructive fluorophore diffusion across cell membranes to provide an unbiased fluorescence intensity readout is critical for quantitative imaging applications in live cells and tissues. Commercially available small-molecule fluorophores have been engineered for biological compatibility, imparting high water solubility by modifying rhodamine and cyanine dye scaffolds with multiple sulfonate groups. The resulting net negative charge, however, often renders these fluorophores cell-membrane-impermeant. Here we report the design and development of our biologically compatible, water-soluble and cell-membrane-permeable fluorophores, termed OregonFluor (ORFluor). By adapting previously established ratiometric imaging methodology using bio-affinity agents, it is now possible to use small-molecule ORFluor-labelled therapeutic inhibitors to quantitatively visualize their intracellular distribution and protein target-specific binding, providing a chemical toolkit for quantifying drug target availability in live cells and tissues. Water-soluble, cell-permeable, inert fluorescent tags called OregonFluors have been developed to withstand environmental changes while resistant towards non-specific binding with subcellular structures. These tags enable quantitative imaging of drug target availability in cells and tissues, providing a route for the future assessment of personalized therapies.

Dynamics of oligomer populations formed during the aggregation of Alzheimer’s Aβ42 peptide

Oligomeric species populated during the aggregation of the Aβ42 peptide have been identified as potent cytotoxins linked to Alzheimer’s disease, but the fundamental molecular pathways that control their dynamics have yet to be elucidated. By developing a general approach that combines theory, experiment and simulation, we reveal, in molecular detail, the mechanisms of Aβ42 oligomer dynamics during amyloid fibril formation. Even though all mature amyloid fibrils must originate as oligomers, we found that most Aβ42 oligomers dissociate into their monomeric precursors without forming new fibrils. Only a minority of oligomers converts into fibrillar structures. Moreover, the heterogeneous ensemble of oligomeric species interconverts on timescales comparable to those of aggregation. Our results identify fundamentally new steps that could be targeted by therapeutic interventions designed to combat protein misfolding diseases. Aβ42 oligomers are key toxic species associated with protein aggregation; however, the molecular pathways determining the dynamics of oligomer populations have remained unknown. Now, direct measurements of oligomer populations, coupled to theory and computer simulations, define and quantify the dynamics of Aβ42 oligomers formed during amyloid aggregation.

Polyyne formation via skeletal rearrangement induced by atomic manipulation

Rearrangements that change the connectivity of a carbon skeleton are often useful in synthesis, but it can be difficult to follow their mechanisms. Scanning probe microscopy can be used to manipulate a skeletal rearrangement at the single-molecule level, while monitoring the geometry of reactants, intermediates and final products with atomic resolution. We studied the reductive rearrangement of 1,1-dibromo alkenes to polyynes on a NaCl surface at 5 K, a reaction that resembles the Fritsch–Buttenberg–Wiechell rearrangement. Voltage pulses were used to cleave one C–Br bond, forming a radical, then to cleave the remaining C•–Br bond, triggering the rearrangement. These experiments provide structural insight into the bromo-vinyl radical intermediates, showing that the C=C•–Br unit is nonlinear. Long polyynes, up to the octayne Ph–(C≡C)8–Ph, have been prepared in this way. The control of skeletal rearrangements opens a new window on carbon-rich materials and extends the toolbox for molecular synthesis by atom manipulation. Atomic manipulation was used to control the reductive rearrangement of 1,1-dibromo alkenes to acetylenes on a NaCl surface at 5 K, and the stages of the reaction were visualized with atomic resolution using AFM. Polyynes ranging from triyne to octayne were prepared in this way, and STM was used to map their frontier orbitals and determine their transport gaps.

Title: 
Heteromeric three-stranded coiled coils designed using a Pb(ii)(Cys)3 template mediated strategy

Three-stranded coiled coils are peptide structures constructed from amphipathic heptad repeats. Here we show that it is possible to form pure heterotrimeric three-stranded coiled coils by combining three distinct characteristics: (1) a cysteine sulfur layer for metal coordination, (2) a thiophilic, trigonal pyramidal metalloid (Pb(ii)) that binds to these sulfurs and (3) an adjacent layer of reduced steric bulk generating a cavity where water can hydrogen bond to the cysteine sulfur atoms. Cysteine substitution in an a site yields Pb(ii)A2B heterotrimers, while d sites provide pure Pb(ii)C2D or Pb(ii)CD2 scaffolds. Altering the metal from Pb(ii) to Hg(ii) or shifting the relative position of the sterically less demanding layer removes heterotrimer specificity. Because only two of the eight or ten hydrophobic layers are perturbed, catalytic sites can be introduced at other regions of the scaffold. A Zn(ii)(histidine)3(H2O) centre can be incorporated at a remote location without perturbing the heterotrimer selectivity, suggesting a unique strategy to prepare dissymmetric catalytic sites within self-assembling de novo-designed proteins. A method to fabricate heterotrimeric three-stranded coiled-coil peptide structures has now been developed using coordination around a Pb(ii) centre. The heterotrimeric structures require only three cysteines that bind to Pb(ii) to form a trigonal pyramidal structure, and the formation of an adjacent cavity in which water can hydrogen bond to the cysteine sulfur atoms.

Spin-dependent reactivity and spin-flipping dynamics in oxygen atom scattering from graphite

The formation of two-electron chemical bonds requires the alignment of spins. Hence, it is well established for gas-phase reactions that changing a molecule’s electronic spin state can dramatically alter its reactivity. For reactions occurring at surfaces, which are of great interest during, among other processes, heterogeneous catalysis, there is an absence of definitive state-to-state experiments capable of observing spin conservation and therefore the role of electronic spin in surface chemistry remains controversial. Here we use an incoming/outgoing correlation ion imaging technique to perform scattering experiments for O(3P) and O(1D) atoms colliding with a graphite surface, in which the initial spin-state distribution is controlled and the final spin states determined. We demonstrate that O(1D) is more reactive with graphite than O(3P). We also identify electronically nonadiabatic pathways whereby incident O(1D) is quenched to O(3P), which departs from the surface. With the help of molecular dynamics simulations carried out on high-dimensional machine-learning-assisted first-principles potential energy surfaces, we obtain a mechanistic understanding for this system: spin-forbidden transitions do occur, but with low probabilities. Electronic spin influences chemistry profoundly, but its role in surface chemistry is poorly established. Now the spin-dependent reaction probabilities of oxygen atoms with a graphite surface have been studied. Molecular dynamics simulations help elucidate the mechanism for spin-flipping, which is observed to occur with low probability in surface scattering experiments.

Hydrolytic stability in hemilabile metal–organic frameworks

Highly porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which have undergone exciting developments over the past few decades, show promise for a wide range of applications. However, many studies indicate that they suffer from significant stability issues, especially with respect to their interactions with water, which severely limits their practical potential. Here we demonstrate how the presence of ‘sacrificial’ bonds in the coordination environment of its metal centres (referred to as hemilability) endows a dehydrated copper-based MOF with good hydrolytic stability. On exposure to water, in contrast to the indiscriminate breaking of coordination bonds that typically results in structure degradation, it is non-structural weak interactions between the MOF’s copper paddlewheel clusters that are broken and the framework recovers its as-synthesized, hydrated structure. This MOF retained its structural integrity even after contact with water for one year, whereas HKUST-1, a compositionally similar material that lacks these sacrificial bonds, loses its crystallinity in less than a day under the same conditions. The promise shown by metal–organic frameworks for various applications is somewhat dampened by their instability towards water. Now, an activated MOF has shown good hydrolytic stability owing to the presence of weak, sacrificial coordination bonds that act as a ‘crumple zone’. On hydration, these weak bonds are cleaved preferentially to stronger coordination bonds that hold the MOF together.

Switching on prodrugs using radiotherapy

Chemotherapy is a powerful tool in the armoury against cancer, but it is fraught with problems due to its global systemic toxicity. Here we report the proof of concept of a chemistry-based strategy, whereby gamma/X-ray irradiation mediates the activation of a cancer prodrug, thereby enabling simultaneous chemo-radiotherapy with radiotherapy locally activating a prodrug. In an initial demonstration, we show the activation of a fluorescent probe using this approach. Expanding on this, we show how sulfonyl azide- and phenyl azide-caged prodrugs of pazopanib and doxorubicin can be liberated using clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation. This strategy is different to conventional chemo-radiotherapy radiation, where chemo-sensitization of the cancer takes place so that subsequent radiotherapy is more effective. This approach could enable site-directed chemotherapy, rather than systemic chemotherapy, with ‘real time’ drug decaging at the tumour site. As such, it opens up a new era in targeted and directed chemotherapy. Prodrugs offer one route to treat cancer, but they require activation once they have been delivered to the tumour. Now, a simultaneous chemo-radiotherapy strategy has been demonstrated in mice that uses gamma or X-ray irradiation to locally activate an anticancer prodrug.

Decarboxylative alkylation for site-selective bioconjugation of native proteins via oxidation potentials

The advent of antibody–drug conjugates as pharmaceuticals has fuelled a need for reliable methods of site-selective protein modification that furnish homogeneous adducts. Although bioorthogonal methods that use engineered amino acids often provide an elegant solution to the question of selective functionalization, achieving homogeneity using native amino acids remains a challenge. Here, we explore visible-light-mediated single-electron transfer as a mechanism towards enabling site- and chemoselective bioconjugation. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of photoredox catalysis as a platform to selectivity wherein the discrepancy in oxidation potentials between internal versus C-terminal carboxylates can be exploited towards obtaining C-terminal functionalization exclusively. This oxidation potential-gated technology is amenable to endogenous peptides and has been successfully demonstrated on the protein insulin. As a fundamentally new approach to bioconjugation this methodology provides a blueprint toward the development of photoredox catalysis as a generic platform to target other redox-active side chains for native conjugation. Selectively targeting native amino acids for late-stage protein modification is a significant challenge, but now it has been shown that photoredox catalysis can be used to specifically target protein C-termini toward decarboxylative-alkylation with Michael acceptors. This technology harnesses innate differences in side-chain oxidation potentials to select between the various functional groups typical among proteins in order to form a single modified product.

Autonomous dynamic control of DNA nanostructure self-assembly

Biological cells routinely reconfigure their shape using dynamic signalling and regulatory networks that direct self-assembly processes in time and space, through molecular components that sense, process and transmit information from the environment. A similar strategy could be used to enable life-like behaviours in synthetic materials. Nucleic acid nanotechnology offers a promising route towards this goal through a variety of sensors, logic and dynamic components and self-assembling structures. Here, by harnessing both dynamic and structural DNA nanotechnology, we demonstrate dynamic control of the self-assembly of DNA nanotubes—a well-known class of programmable DNA nanostructures. Nanotube assembly and disassembly is controlled with minimal synthetic gene systems, including an autonomous molecular oscillator. We use a coarse-grained computational model to capture nanotube length distribution dynamics in response to inputs from nucleic acid circuits. We hope that these results may find use for the development of responsive nucleic acid materials, with potential applications in biomaterials science, nanofabrication and drug delivery. Nucleic acid nanotechnology offers a promising route towards the design and synthesis of reconfigurable biomolecular materials. Now, the combination of dynamic and structural DNA nanotechnology has enabled the dynamic control of the assembly and disassembly of DNA nanotubes. The process involves minimal synthetic gene systems, including an autonomous molecular oscillator.

Title: 
Decarboxylative cross-nucleophile coupling via ligand-to-metal charge transfer photoexcitation of Cu(ii) carboxylates

Reactions that enable carbon–nitrogen, carbon–oxygen and carbon–carbon bond formation lie at the heart of synthetic chemistry. However, substrate prefunctionalization is often needed to effect such transformations without forcing reaction conditions. The development of direct coupling methods for abundant feedstock chemicals is therefore highly desirable for the rapid construction of complex molecular scaffolds. Here we report a copper-mediated, net-oxidative decarboxylative coupling of carboxylic acids with diverse nucleophiles under visible-light irradiation. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the relevant chromophore in this reaction is a Cu(ii) carboxylate species assembled in situ. We propose that visible-light excitation to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) state results in a radical decarboxylation process that initiates the oxidative cross-coupling. The reaction is applicable to a wide variety of coupling partners, including complex drug molecules, suggesting that this strategy for cross-nucleophile coupling would facilitate rapid compound library synthesis for the discovery of new pharmaceutical agents. Direct coupling methods, which do not require substrate prefunctionalization, are highly desirable for the construction of complex molecular scaffolds. Now, a photochemical method has been developed for the direct decarboxylative coupling of carboxylic acids with diverse nitrogen, oxygen and carbon nucleophiles, taking advantage of the photochemistry of copper(II) carboxylate complexes assembled in situ.

Stereodefined alkenes with a fluoro-chloro terminus as a uniquely enabling compound class

Trisubstituted alkenyl fluorides are important compounds for drug discovery, agrochemical development and materials science. Despite notable progress, however, many stereochemically defined trisubstituted fluoroalkenes either cannot be prepared efficiently or can only be accessed in one isomeric form. Here we outline a general solution to this problem by first unveiling a practical, widely applicable and catalytic strategy for stereodivergent synthesis of olefins bearing a fluoro-chloro terminus. This has been accomplished by cross-metathesis between two trisubstituted olefins, one of which is a purchasable but scarcely utilized trihaloalkene. Subsequent cross-coupling can then be used to generate an assortment of trisubstituted alkenyl fluorides. The importance of the advance is highlighted by syntheses of, among others, a fluoronematic liquid-crystal component, peptide analogues bearing an E- or a Z-amide bond mimic, and all four stereoisomers of difluororumenic ester (an anti-cancer compound). Stereochemically defined trisubstituted alkenyl fluorides are important compounds for drug discovery, agrochemical development and materials science, but their preparation is challenging. Now, a practical and widely applicable catalytic strategy enables access to a large assortment of olefins bearing a fluoro-chloro terminus. Subsequent cross-coupling generates the corresponding trisubstituted alkenyl fluorides.

Harvesting multiple electron–hole pairs generated through plasmonic excitation of Au nanoparticles

Multi-electron redox reactions, although central to artificial photosynthesis, are kinetically sluggish. Amidst the search for synthetic catalysts for such processes, plasmonic nanoparticles have been found to catalyse multi-electron reduction of CO2 under visible light. This example motivates the need for a general, insight-driven framework for plasmonic catalysis of such multi-electron chemistry. Here, we elucidate the principles underlying the extraction of multiple redox equivalents from a plasmonic photocatalyst. We measure the kinetics of electron harvesting from a gold nanoparticle photocatalyst as a function of photon flux. Our measurements, supported by theoretical modelling, reveal a regime where two-electron transfer from the excited gold nanoparticle becomes prevalent. Multiple electron harvesting becomes possible under continuous-wave, visible-light excitation of moderate intensity due to strong interband transitions in gold and electron–hole separation accomplished using a hole scavenger. These insights will help expand the utility of plasmonic photocatalysis beyond CO2 reduction to other challenging multi-electron, multi-proton transformations such as N2 fixation. Multi-electron redox reactions are kinetically sluggish; however, plasmonic nanoparticles have shown promise as multi-electron reduction catalysts. Now, the principles that govern the harvesting of multiple electron–hole pairs from plasmonically excited gold nanoparticle photocatalysts are elucidated, providing a general foundation for the plasmonic catalysis of challenging multi-electron, multi-proton chemistry, such as N2 fixation and CO2 reduction.

Reversible transformations between the non-porous phases of a flexible coordination network enabled by transient porosity

Flexible metal–organic materials that exhibit stimulus-responsive switching between closed (non-porous) and open (porous) structures induced by gas molecules are of potential utility in gas storage and separation. Such behaviour is currently limited to a few dozen physisorbents that typically switch through a breathing mechanism requiring structural contortions. Here we show a clathrate (non-porous) coordination network that undergoes gas-induced switching between multiple non-porous phases through transient porosity, which involves the diffusion of guests between discrete voids through intra-network distortions. This material is synthesized as a clathrate phase with solvent-filled cavities; evacuation affords a single-crystal to single-crystal transformation to a phase with smaller cavities. At 298 K, carbon dioxide, acetylene, ethylene and ethane induce reversible switching between guest-free and gas-loaded clathrate phases. For carbon dioxide and acetylene at cryogenic temperatures, phases showing progressively higher loadings were observed and characterized using in situ X-ray diffraction, and the mechanism of diffusion was computationally elucidated. Sorbent materials that reversibly transform between closed (non-porous) and open (porous) phases on the uptake and release of guests are relevant to gas storage and separation applications. Now, a coordination network has been prepared that exhibits gas-induced transformations between multiple non-porous phases. This phenomenon is attributed to subtle structural rearrangements that enable transient porosity.

Enzymatic control of cycloadduct conformation ensures reversible 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition in a prFMN-dependent decarboxylase

The UbiD enzyme plays an important role in bacterial ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) biosynthesis. It belongs to a family of reversible decarboxylases that interconvert propenoic or aromatic acids with the corresponding alkenes or aromatic compounds using a prenylated flavin mononucleotide cofactor. This cofactor is suggested to support (de)carboxylation through a reversible 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition process. Here, we report an atomic-level description of the reaction of the UbiD-related ferulic acid decarboxylase with substituted propenoic and propiolic acids (data ranging from 1.01–1.39 Å). The enzyme is only able to couple (de)carboxylation of cinnamic acid-type compounds to reversible 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, while the formation of dead-end prenylated flavin mononucleotide cycloadducts occurs with distinct propenoic and propiolic acids. The active site imposes considerable strain on covalent intermediates formed with cinnamic and phenylpropiolic acids. Strain reduction through mutagenesis negatively affects catalytic rates with cinnamic acid, indicating a direct link between enzyme-induced strain and catalysis that is supported by computational studies. The UbiD family of reversible decarboxylases interconvert propenoic or aromatic acids with the corresponding alkenes or aromatic compounds, using a transient 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between the substrate and the prenylated flavin mononucleotide cofactor. Atomic-resolution crystallography shows targeted destabilization of the intermediate covalent adducts, allowing the enzyme to harness 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition as a readily reversible reaction.

Single crystals of mechanically entwined helical covalent polymers

Double helical conformation of polymer chains is widely observed in biomacromolecules and plays an essential role in exerting their biological functions, such as molecular recognition and information storage. It has remained challenging, however, to prepare synthetic helical polymers, and those that exist have mainly been limited to single-stranded polymers or short oligomeric double helices. Here, we report the synthesis of covalent helical polymers, with a high molecular weight, from the achiral monomer hexahydroxytriphenylene through to spiroborate formation. Polymerization and crystallization occurred simultaneously under solvothermal conditions to form single crystals of the resulting helical covalent polymers. Characterization by single-crystal X-ray diffraction showed that each crystal consisted of pairs of mechanically entwined polymers. No strong non-covalent interactions were observed between the two helical polymers that formed a pair; instead, each strand interacted with neighbouring pairs through hydrogen bonding. Each individual crystal was made up of helical polymers of the same handedness, but the crystallization process produced a racemic conglomerate, with equal amounts of right-handed and left-handed crystals. Single crystals of a helical covalent polymer have been obtained from an achiral monomer through spiroborate formation. Polymerization and crystallization occur simultaneously to give a network of pairs of entwined helical strands of the same handedness. No strong non-covalent interactions were observed between the two helical polymers forming a pair; instead, each interacts with neighbouring pairs through hydrogen bonding.

Quaternary stereocentres via catalytic enantioconvergent nucleophilic substitution reactions of tertiary alkyl halides

The development of efficient methods, particularly catalytic and enantioselective processes, for the construction of all-carbon quaternary stereocentres is an important (and difficult) challenge in organic synthesis due to the occurrence of this motif in a range of bioactive molecules. One conceptually straightforward and potentially versatile approach is the catalytic enantioconvergent substitution reaction of a readily available racemic tertiary alkyl electrophile by an organometallic nucleophile; however, examples of such processes are rare. Here we demonstrate that a nickel-based chiral catalyst achieves enantioconvergent couplings of a variety of tertiary electrophiles (cyclic and acyclic α-halocarbonyl compounds) with alkenylmetal nucleophiles to form quaternary stereocentres with good yield and enantioselectivity under mild conditions in the presence of a range of functional groups. These couplings, which probably proceed via a radical pathway, provide access to an array of useful families of organic compounds, including intermediates in the total synthesis of two natural products, (–)-eburnamonine and madindoline A. A wide variety of bioactive molecules contain stereogenic quaternary carbons, and developing methods for the construction of these stereocentres continues to be an active area of research. Now, it has been shown that a nickel-catalysed enantioconvergent coupling of tertiary alkyl electrophiles with alkenylmetal nucleophiles—which probably proceeds via a radical pathway—can form and set quaternary stereocentres efficiently under mild conditions.

Vibration-driven reaction of CO2 on Cu surfaces via Eley–Rideal-type mechanism

Understanding gas–surface reaction dynamics, such as the rupture and formation of bonds in vibrationally and translationally excited (‘hot’) molecules, is important to provide mechanistic insight into heterogeneous catalytic processes. Although it has been established that such excitation can affect the reactions occurring via dissociative mechanisms, for associative mechanisms—in which the gas-phase reactant collides directly with a surface-adsorbed species—only translational excitation has been observed to affect reactivity. Here we report a bond-formation reaction that is driven by the vibrational energy of reactant molecules and occurs via an (associative) Eley–Rideal-type mechanism, in which the reaction takes place in a single collision. Hot CO2 in a molecular beam is found to react with pre-adsorbed hydrogen atoms directly on cold Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces to form formate adspecies. The vibrational energy of CO2 is more effective at promoting the reaction than translational energy, the reaction rate is independent of the surface temperature and the experimental results are consistent with density functional theory calculations. Vibrational and translational energies have previously been observed to promote reactions at surfaces occurring via dissociative mechanisms. Now, it has been shown that the reaction of CO2 with surface-adsorbed atomic hydrogen—which occurs via an associative (Eley–Rideal-type) mechanism—can be driven by vibrationally exciting CO2.

Intersystem crossing in the entrance channel of the reaction of O(3P) with pyridine

Two quantum effects can enable reactions to take place at energies below the barrier separating reactants from products: tunnelling and intersystem crossing between coupled potential energy surfaces. Here we show that intersystem crossing in the region between the pre-reactive complex and the reaction barrier can control the rate of bimolecular reactions for weakly coupled potential energy surfaces, even in the absence of heavy atoms. For O(3P) plus pyridine, a reaction relevant to combustion, astrochemistry and biochemistry, crossed-beam experiments indicate that the dominant products are pyrrole and CO, obtained through a spin-forbidden ring-contraction mechanism. The experimental findings are interpreted—by high-level quantum-chemical calculations and statistical non-adiabatic computations of branching fractions—in terms of an efficient intersystem crossing occurring before the high entrance barrier for O-atom addition to the N-atom lone pair. At low to moderate temperatures, the computed reaction rates prove to be dominated by intersystem crossing. Intersystem crossing in reaction entrance channels usually arises from ‘heavy-atom’ effects. Now molecular-beam experiments show that even without heavy atoms, the O(3P) + pyridine reaction leads to spin-forbidden pyrrole + CO products. Theoretical calculations reveal efficient intersystem crossing before the entrance barrier for O-atom addition to the N-atom lone pair, which dominates reactivity at low to moderate temperatures.

Identification of the strong Brønsted acid site in a metal–organic framework solid acid catalyst

It remains difficult to understand the surface of solid acid catalysts at the molecular level, despite their importance for industrial catalytic applications. A sulfated zirconium-based metal–organic framework, MOF-808-SO4, was previously shown to be a strong solid Brønsted acid material. In this report, we probe the origin of its acidity through an array of spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational characterization techniques. The strongest Brønsted acid site is shown to consist of a specific arrangement of adsorbed water and sulfate moieties on the zirconium clusters. When a water molecule adsorbs to one zirconium atom, it participates in a hydrogen bond with a sulfate moiety that is chelated to a neighbouring zirconium atom; this motif, in turn, results in the presence of a strongly acidic proton. On dehydration, the material loses its acidity. The hydrated sulfated MOF exhibits a good catalytic performance for the dimerization of isobutene (2-methyl-1-propene), and achieves a 100% selectivity for C8 products with a good conversion efficiency. Solid acid heterogeneous catalysts are widely used in industrial chemical processes, but understanding the exact molecular structures responsible for catalytic activity has proved difficult. Now, the structure of the strong Brønsted acid site for a sulfated zirconium-based metal–organic framework has been shown to consist of a specific arrangement of adsorbed water and sulfate moieties on the zirconium clusters.

Isolation, characterization and reactivity of three-coordinate phosphorus dications isoelectronic to alanes and silylium cations

Three-coordinate main group Lewis acids are exceedingly important reagents in chemical synthesis. In contrast to the well-established chemistries of neutral group 13 and cationic group 14 species, isoelectronic group 15 element dications are unknown. In this work, we use stabilizing N-heterocyclic imine substituents to isolate and characterize phosphorandiylium dications ([R3P]2+) and show that the electrophilicity at the phosphorus atoms is controlled by the π-electron-donating ability of these subtituents. Structural, spectroscopic and theoretical results reveal that the phosphorus dications adopt a perfectly trigonal-planar geometry with the electron-deficient phosphorus centres being well separated from the borate anions. The reactivity of the dications reveal their exceptional Lewis acidity at phosphorus; the adjacent nitrogen atoms, however, are weakly basic, resulting in transformations such as chloride ion abstraction from Me3SiCl and the selective monodefluorination of trifluoromethyl groups. The isoelectronic series of alanes [R3Al] and silylium cations [R3Si]+ has now been extended with the synthesis and characterization of two phosphorandiylium dications ([R3P]2+), which are trigonal planar Lewis superacids. The electrophilicity at the phosphorus atom is governed by the π-electron-donating ability of the attached N-heterocyclic imine substituents.

Title: 
Maleimide–thiol adducts stabilized through stretching

Maleimide–thiol reactions are widely used to produce protein–polymer conjugates for therapeutics. However, maleimide–thiol adducts are unstable in vivo or in the presence of thiol-containing compounds because of the elimination of the thiosuccinimide linkage through a retro-Michael reaction or thiol exchange. Here, using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we show that applying an appropriate stretching force to the thiosuccinimide linkage can considerably stabilize the maleimide–thiol adducts, in effect using conventional mechanochemistry of force-accelerated bond dissociation to unconventionally stabilize an adjacent bond. Single-molecule kinetic analysis and bulk structural characterizations suggest that hydrolysis of the succinimide ring is dominant over the retro-Michael reaction through a force-dependent kinetic control mechanism, and this leads to a product that is resistant to elimination. This unconventional mechanochemical approach enabled us to produce stable polymer–protein conjugates by simply applying a mechanical force to the maleimide–thiol adducts through mild ultrasonication. Our results demonstrate the great potential of mechanical force for stimulating important productive chemical transformations. Single-molecule force spectroscopy reveals that maleimide–thiol adducts can be stabilized by stretching through a force-dependent kinetic control mechanism. This unconventional use of mechanochemistry enabled us to produce stable polymer–protein conjugates by simply applying a mechanical force to the maleimide–thiol adducts through mild ultrasonication.

Isolable dicarbon stabilized by a single phosphine ligand

In contrast to naturally occurring F2, O2 and N2, diatomic C2 is an intriguing species that has only been observed indirectly in the gas phase, and because of its high reactivity has eluded isolation in the condensed phase. It has previously been stabilized in L→C2←L compounds but the bonding situation of the central C2 in this motif differs remarkably from that of free C2. Here we have prepared and structurally characterized diatomic C2 as a monoligated complex L→C2 using a bulky phosphine ligand bearing two imidazolidin-2-iminato groups (L is (NHCR=N)2(CH3)P, where NHCR is an N-heterocyclic carbene). The compound is stable in solution at ambient temperature and has also been isolated in the solid state. Reactivity studies, in combination with quantum chemical analysis, suggest that the two carbon atoms of the L→C2 complex both have carbene character. The complex underwent intermolecular C–H bond activation upon thermolysis and exhibited hydroalkoxylation-like reactivity with methanol. Diatomic C2 is an elusive species that has only been indirectly observed in the gas phase. It had previously been stabilized in the condensed phase using two ligands, but now a monoligated L→C2 complex has been prepared with a bulky phosphine ligand (L) bearing two imidazolidin-2-iminato groups. Reactivity studies and theoretical quantum chemical analysis point to the C2 moiety having a dicarbene character.

Electron spin resonance of single iron phthalocyanine molecules and role of their non-localized spins in magnetic interactions

Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is a crucial tool, through spin labelling, in investigations of the chemical structure of materials and of the electronic structure of materials associated with unpaired spins. ESR spectra measured in molecular systems, however, are established on large ensembles of spins and usually require a complicated structural analysis. Recently, the combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy with ESR has proved to be a powerful tool to image and coherently control individual atomic spins on surfaces. Here we extend this technique to single coordination complexes—iron phthalocyanines (FePc)—and investigate the magnetic interactions between their molecular spin with either another molecular spin (in FePc–FePc dimers) or an atomic spin (in FePc–Ti pairs). We show that the molecular spin density of FePc is both localized at the central Fe atom and also distributed to the ligands (Pc), which yields a strongly molecular-geometry-dependent exchange coupling. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy has traditionally been used to study large ensembles of spins, but its combination with scanning tunnelling microscopy recently enabled measurements on single adatoms. Now, individual iron phthalocyanine complexes adsorbed on a surface have been probed. Their spin distribution partially extends on the phthalocyanine, leading to a strong geometry-dependent exchange coupling interaction.

Modulation of porosity in a solid material enabled by bulk photoisomerization of an overcrowded alkene

The incorporation of photoswitchable molecules into solid-state materials holds promise for the fabrication of responsive materials, the properties of which can be controlled on-demand. However, the possible applications of these materials are limited due to the restrictions imposed by the solid-state environment on the incorporated photoswitches, which render the photoisomerization inefficient. Here we present responsive porous switchable framework materials based on a bistable chiroptical overcrowded alkene incorporated in the backbone of a rigid aromatic framework. As a consequence of the high intrinsic porosity, the resulting framework readily responds to a light stimulus, as demonstrated by solid-state Raman and reflectance spectroscopies. Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy highlights an efficient and quantitative bulk photoisomerization of the incorporated light-responsive overcrowded olefins in the solid material. Taking advantage of the quantitative photoisomerization, the porosity of the framework and the consequent gas adsorption can be reversibly modulated in response to light and heat. Despite numerous potential applications, the development of light-responsive solid materials based on molecular photoswitches is impeded by the low efficiency of photoisomerization in the solid environment. Now a robust, solid porous material made from tetraphenylmethane and a photoswitchable overcrowded alkene exhibits nearly quantitative photoisomerization in the bulk and in photomodulation of gas uptake.

Spin-crossover nanoparticles anchored on MoS2 layers for heterostructures with tunable strain driven by thermal or light-induced spin switching

In the past few years, the effect of strain on the optical and electronic properties of MoS2 layers has attracted particular attention as it can improve the performance of optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Although several approaches have been explored, strain is typically externally applied on the two-dimensional material. In this work, we describe the preparation of a reversible ‘self-strainable’ system in which the strain is generated at the molecular level by one component of a MoS2-based composite material. Spin-crossover nanoparticles were covalently grafted onto functionalized layers of semiconducting MoS2 to form a hybrid heterostructure. Their ability to switch between two spin states on applying an external stimulus (light irradiation or temperature change) serves to generate strain over the MoS2 layer. A volume change accompanies this spin crossover, and the created strain induces a substantial and reversible change of the electrical and optical properties of the heterostructure. Spin-crossover nanoparticles have been covalently grafted onto a semiconducting MoS2 layer to form a self-strainable heterostructure. Under light or thermal stimulus, the nanoparticles switch between their high- and low-spin states, in which they have different volumes. This generates a reversible strain over the MoS2 layer and, in turn, alters the electrical and optical properties of the heterostructure.

Title: 
Thiophene and its sulfur inhibit indenoindenodibenzothiophene diradicals from low-energy lying thermal triplets

Many qualitative structure–property correlations between diradical character and emerging molecular properties are known. For example, the increase of diradical character further decreases the singlet–triplet energy gap. Here we show that inclusion of thiophenes within a quinoidal polycyclic hydrocarbon imparts appreciable diradical character yet retains the large singlet–triplet energy gap, a phenomenon that has no precedent in the literature. The low aromatic character of thiophene and its electron-rich nature are the key properties leading to these unique findings. A new indenoindenodibenzothiophene scaffold has been prepared and fully characterized by several spectroscopies, magnetic measurements, solid-state X-ray and state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations, all corroborating this unique dichotomy between the diradical input and the emerging magnetic properties. New structure–property relationships such as these are not only extremely important in the field of diradical chemistry and organic electronics, but also provide new insights into the versatility of π-electron chemical bonding. A paradoxical case of a well-defined diradicaloid that has an unusually large singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔES-T) imparted by the thiophene sulfur atom is reported. Quantum chemistry, organic synthesis, molecular spectroscopies, X-ray crystal analysis and high-temperature magnetic measurements help account for the dichotomy between the large diradical character and large ΔEST.

Mimicry of the proton wire mechanism of enzymes inside a supramolecular capsule enables β-selective O-glycosylations

Enzymes achieve high substrate and product selectivities by orientating and activating the substrate(s) appropriately inside a confined and finely optimized binding pocket. Although some basic aspects of enzymes have already been mimicked successfully with man-made catalysts, substrate activation by proton wires inside enzyme pockets has not been recreated with man-made catalysts so far. A proton wire facilitates the dual activation of a nucleophile and an electrophile via a reciprocal proton transfer, enabling highly stereoselective reactions under mild conditions. Here we present evidence for such an activation mode inside the supramolecular resorcin[4]arene capsule and demonstrate that it enables catalytic and highly β-selective glycosylation reactions—still a major challenge in glycosylation chemistry. Extensive control experiments provide very strong evidence that the reactions take place inside the molecular container. We show that this activation strategy is compatible with a broad scope of glycoside donors and nucleophiles, and is only limited by the cavity size. Proton wires in enzyme active sites enable stereoselective reactions under mild conditions by facilitating dual activation of a nucleophile and an electrophile through reciprocal proton transfer. Now it has been shown that such an activation mode can be mimicked inside a supramolecular capsule, enabling a general approach to β-glycosides.

De novo engineering of intracellular condensates using artificial disordered proteins

Phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is a remarkable feature of living cells to dynamically control intracellular partitioning. Despite the numerous new IDPs that have been identified, progress towards rational engineering in cells has been limited. To address this limitation, we systematically scanned the sequence space of native IDPs and designed artificial IDPs (A-IDPs) with different molecular weights and aromatic content, which exhibit variable condensate saturation concentrations and temperature cloud points in vitro and in cells. We created A-IDP puncta using these simple principles, which are capable of sequestering an enzyme and whose catalytic efficiency can be manipulated by the molecular weight of the A-IDP. These results provide a robust engineered platform for creating puncta with new, phase-separation-mediated control of biological function in living cells. Artificial intrinsically disordered proteins (A-IDPs) have now been shown to form exclusionary, intracellular droplets that can be designed using simple principles that are based on the aromatic/aliphatic ratio and molecular weight. Droplets that sequester an enzyme and modulate enzyme efficiency on the basis of the molecular weight of the A-IDPs were also engineered using A-IDPs as a minimal condensate scaffold.

Title: 
An artificial interphase enables reversible magnesium chemistry in carbonate electrolytes

Magnesium-based batteries possess potential advantages over their lithium counterparts. However, reversible Mg chemistry requires a thermodynamically stable electrolyte at low potential, which is usually achieved with corrosive components and at the expense of stability against oxidation. In lithium-ion batteries the conflict between the cathodic and anodic stabilities of the electrolytes is resolved by forming an anode interphase that shields the electrolyte from being reduced. This strategy cannot be applied to Mg batteries because divalent Mg2+ cannot penetrate such interphases. Here, we engineer an artificial Mg2+-conductive interphase on the Mg anode surface, which successfully decouples the anodic and cathodic requirements for electrolytes and demonstrate highly reversible Mg chemistry in oxidation-resistant electrolytes. The artificial interphase enables the reversible cycling of a Mg/V2O5 full-cell in the water-containing, carbonate-based electrolyte. This approach provides a new avenue not only for Mg but also for other multivalent-cation batteries facing the same problems, taking a step towards their use in energy-storage applications. Mg-based batteries possess potential advantages over their lithium counterparts; however, the use of reversible oxidation-resistant, carbonate-based electrolytes has been hindered because of their undesirable electrochemical reduction reactions. Now, by engineering a Mg2+-conductive artificial interphase on a Mg electrode surface, which prevents such reactivity, highly reversible Mg deposition/stripping in carbonate-based electrolytes has been demonstrated.

Catalytic enantiocontrol over a non-classical carbocation

Carbocations can be categorized into classical carbenium ions and non-classical carbonium ions. These intermediates are ubiquitous in reactions of both fundamental and practical relevance, finding application in the petroleum industry as well as the discovery of new drugs and materials. Conveying stereochemical information to carbocations is therefore of interest to a range of chemical fields. While previous studies targeted systems proceeding through classical ions, enantiocontrol over their non-classical counterparts has remained unprecedented. Here we show that strong and confined chiral acids catalyse enantioselective reactions via the non-classical 2-norbornyl cation. This reactive intermediate is generated from structurally different precursors by leveraging the reactivity of various functional groups to ultimately deliver the same enantioenriched product. Our work demonstrates that tailored catalysts can act as suitable hosts for simple, non-functionalized carbocations via a network of non-covalent interactions. We anticipate that the methods described herein will provide catalytic accessibility to valuable carbocation systems. In 1949, Winstein and Trifan proposed that the 2-norbornyl cation adopts a bridged, non-classical structure. Now, the generation of an asymmetric environment around the three-centre two-electron bond of such an ion has been reported, enabling highly enantioselective catalytic addition reactions to a simple, non-functionalized non-classical cation.

Title: 
Orthogonal cross-coupling through intermolecular metathesis of unstrained C(aryl)–C(aryl) single bonds

While metathesis reactions involving carbon–carbon double bonds, namely olefin metathesis, have been well established with broad utility in organic synthesis and materials science, direct metathesis of kinetically less accessible C–C single bonds is extremely rare. Here we report a ruthenium-catalysed reversible C–C single-bond metathesis reaction that allows redox- and pH-neutral biaryl synthesis. Assisted by directing groups, unstrained homo-biaryl compounds undergo aryl exchanges to generate cross-biaryl products, catalysed by a well-defined air-stable ruthenium(II) complex. Functional groups reactive under typical cross-coupling reactions, such as halogen, silyl and boronate moieties, are compatible under the metathesis conditions. Mechanistic studies disclose an intriguing ‘olefin-metathesis-like’ pathway that involves an unexpected heptacoordinated, 18-electron closed-shell intermediate. The distinct reaction mode discovered here is expected to inspire the development of more general C–C single-bond metathesis and orthogonal cross-coupling reactions. Metathesis reactions involving carbon–carbon double bonds have been well established, but direct metathesis of carbon–carbon single bonds is extremely rare. Now, a ruthenium-catalysed carbon–carbon single-bond metathesis reaction has been developed with unstrained homo-biaryl substrates. The reaction shows wide functional group tolerance and operates via an ‘olefin-metathesis-like’ mechanism.

Deep learning study of tyrosine reveals that roaming can lead to photodamage

Amino acids are among the building blocks of life, forming peptides and proteins, and have been carefully ‘selected’ to prevent harmful reactions caused by light. To prevent photodamage, molecules relax from electronic excited states to the ground state faster than the harmful reactions can occur; however, such photochemistry is not fully understood, in part because theoretical simulations of such systems are extremely expensive—with only smaller chromophores accessible. Here, we study the excited-state dynamics of tyrosine using a method based on deep neural networks that leverages the physics underlying quantum chemical data and combines different levels of theory. We reveal unconventional and dynamically controlled ‘roaming’ dynamics in excited tyrosine that are beyond chemical intuition and compete with other ultrafast deactivation mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the roaming atoms are radicals that can lead to photodamage, offering a new perspective on the photostability and photodamage of biological systems. Amino acids are one of the major building blocks of life, but the ways in which they respond to light excitation are not fully understood. Now, the photochemistry of tyrosine has been studied using physically inspired deep neural networks, leading to the observation of unconventional dynamically controlled reactivity that involves ‘roaming’ radicals that can cause photodamage.

Title: 
Transient water wires mediate selective proton transport in designed channel proteins

Selective proton transport through proteins is essential for forming and using proton gradients in cells. Protons are conducted along hydrogen-bonded ‘wires’ of water molecules and polar side chains, which, somewhat surprisingly, are often interrupted by dry apolar stretches in the conduction pathways, inferred from static protein structures. Here we hypothesize that protons are conducted through such dry spots by forming transient water wires, often highly correlated with the presence of the excess protons in the water wire. To test this hypothesis, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to design transmembrane channels with stable water pockets interspersed by apolar segments capable of forming flickering water wires. The minimalist designed channels conduct protons at rates similar to viral proton channels, and they are at least 106-fold more selective for H+ over Na+. These studies inform the mechanisms of biological proton conduction and the principles for engineering proton-conductive materials. Incorporating polar residues into hydrophobic protein channel pores facilitates selective proton transport. Now, classical and multiscale reactive molecular dynamics simulations of designed channels reveal dynamic water wires within the channel lumen that are proton conductive according to structural and functional validation. These results provide some guiding principles for biological and engineered proton conduction.

Title: 
Asymmetric redox-neutral radical cyclization catalysed by flavin-dependent ‘ene’-reductases

Flavin-dependent ‘ene’-reductases (EREDs) are exquisite catalysts for effecting stereoselective reductions. Although these reactions typically proceed through a hydride transfer mechanism, we recently found that EREDs can also catalyse reductive dehalogenations and cyclizations via single electron transfer mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that these enzymes can catalyse redox-neutral radical cyclizations to produce enantioenriched oxindoles from α-haloamides. This transformation is a C–C bond-forming reaction currently unknown in nature and one for which there are no catalytic asymmetric examples. Mechanistic studies indicate the reaction proceeds via the flavin semiquinone/quinone redox couple, where ground-state flavin semiquinone provides the electron for substrate reduction and flavin quinone oxidizes the vinylogous α-amido radical formed after cyclization. This mechanistic manifold was previously unknown for this enzyme family, highlighting the versatility of EREDs in asymmetric synthesis. Flavin-dependent ‘ene’-reductases have now been shown to catalyse redox-neutral radical cyclizations of α-haloamides to form enantioenriched oxindoles. Mechanistic studies indicate the reaction proceeds via the flavin semiquinone/quinone redox couple, where a ground state flavin semiquinone provides the electron for substrate reduction and flavin quinone oxidizes the radical formed after cyclization.

Synthetic O-acetylated sialosides facilitate functional receptor identification for human respiratory viruses

The transmission of viruses from animal reservoirs to humans poses major threats to public health. Preparedness for future zoonotic outbreaks requires a fundamental understanding of how viruses of animal origin have adapted to binding to a cell surface component and/or receptor of the new host. Here we report on the specificities of human and animal viruses that engage with O-acetylated sialic acid, which include betacoronaviruses, toroviruses and influenza C and D viruses. Key to these studies was the development of a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide almost any sialate-acetylation pattern. A collection of O-acetylated sialoglycans was printed as a microarray for the determination of receptor specificity. These studies showed host-specific patterns of receptor recognition and revealed that three distinct human respiratory viruses uniquely bind 9-O-acetylated α2,8-linked disialoside. Immunofluorescence and cell entry studies support that such a glycotope as part of a ganglioside is a functional receptor for human coronaviruses. The specificity of human and animal viruses that engage with O-acetylated sialic acids has now been probed using a collection of O-acetylated sialoglycans obtained by diversification of trisaccharide precursors with viral haemagglutinin–esterases. The results revealed host-specific patterns of receptor recognition and showed that human respiratory viruses uniquely employ 9-O-acetylated α2,8-linked disialosides as receptors.

Oxygen redox chemistry without excess alkali-metal ions in Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2

The search for improved energy-storage materials has revealed Li- and Na-rich intercalation compounds as promising high-capacity cathodes. They exhibit capacities in excess of what would be expected from alkali-ion removal/reinsertion and charge compensation by transition-metal (TM) ions. The additional capacity is provided through charge compensation by oxygen redox chemistry and some oxygen loss. It has been reported previously that oxygen redox occurs in O 2p orbitals that interact with alkali ions in the TM and alkali-ion layers (that is, oxygen redox occurs in compounds containing Li+–O(2p)–Li+ interactions). Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2 exhibits an excess capacity and here we show that this is caused by oxygen redox, even though Mg2+ resides in the TM layers rather than alkali-metal (AM) ions, which demonstrates that excess AM ions are not required to activate oxygen redox. We also show that, unlike the alkali-rich compounds, Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2 does not lose oxygen. The extraction of alkali ions from the alkali and TM layers in the alkali-rich compounds results in severely underbonded oxygen, which promotes oxygen loss, whereas Mg2+ remains in Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2, which stabilizes oxygen. Alkali-metal-rich compositions (for example, Li[LixM1–x]O2) are promising battery cathode materials that exhibit oxygen redox, which provides additional charge capacity. It is thought to occur in compounds containing alkali ions in the transition metal layers and featuring Li+–O(2p)–Li+ interactions; however, now it is observed in Na2/3[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2, in which Mg2+ ions are present in the transition metal layer.

Ion-pair reorganization regulates reactivity in photoredox catalysts

Cyclometalated and polypyridyl complexes of d6 metals are promising photoredox catalysts, using light to drive reactions with high kinetic or thermodynamic barriers via the generation of reactive radical intermediates. However, while tuning of their redox potentials, absorption energy, excited-state lifetime and quantum yield are well-known criteria for modifying activity, other factors could be important. Here we show that dynamic ion-pair reorganization controls the reactivity of a photoredox catalyst, [Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbpy)]X. Time-resolved dielectric-loss experiments show how counter-ion identity influences excited-state charge distribution, evincing large differences in both the ground- and excited-state dipole moment depending on whether X is a small associating anion (PF6−) that forms a contact-ion pair versus a large one that either dissociates or forms a solvent-separated pair (BArF4−). These differences correlate with the reactivity of the photocatalyst toward both reductive and oxidative electron transfer, amounting to a 4-fold change in selectivity toward oxidation versus reduction. These results suggest that ion pairing could be an underappreciated factor that modulates reactivity in ionic photoredox catalysts. Ion pairing is ubiquitous in low-dielectric-constant solvents, but whether it influences the reactivity of common cationic photoredox catalysts has been unclear. However, it has now been shown that ion pairing is responsible for a 4-fold modulation in reactivity in a prototypical Ir(III) complex and is explained by excited-state ion-pair reorganization.

Title: 
Light-driven molecular trap enables bidirectional manipulation of dynamic covalent systems

Bond formation between two molecular entities in a closed system strictly obeys the principle of microscopic reversibility and occurs in favour of the thermodynamically more stable product. Here, we demonstrate how light can bypass this fundamental limitation by driving and controlling the reversible bimolecular reaction between an N-nucleophile and a photoswitchable carbonyl electrophile. Light-driven tautomerization cycles reverse the reactivity of the C=O/C=N-electrophiles (‘umpolung’) to activate substrates and remove products, respectively, solely depending on the illumination wavelength. By applying either red or blue light, selective and nearly quantitative intermolecular bond formation/scission can be achieved, even if the underlying condensation/hydrolysis equilibrium is thermodynamically disfavoured. Exploiting light-driven in situ C=N exchange, our approach can be used to externally regulate a closed dynamic covalent system by actively and reversibly removing specific components, resembling a molecular and bidirectional version of a macroscopic Dean–Stark trap. Light can selectively drive and control the reversible reaction between a nitrogen nucleophile and a photoswitchable carbonyl electrophile by inducing wavelength-specific tautomerization cycles. This enables external and bidirectional regulation of closed dynamic covalent systems via C=N exchange, resembling a light-powered bidirectional molecular-scale Dean–Stark trap.

Intra- and intermolecular self-assembly of a 20-nm-wide supramolecular hexagonal grid

For the past three decades, the coordination-driven self-assembly of three-dimensional structures has undergone rapid progress; however, parallel efforts to create large discrete two-dimensional architectures—as opposed to polymers—have met with limited success. The synthesis of metallo-supramolecular systems with well-defined shapes and sizes in the range of 10–100 nm remains challenging. Here we report the construction of a series of giant supramolecular hexagonal grids, with diameters on the order of 20 nm and molecular weights greater than 65 kDa, through a combination of intra- and intermolecular metal-mediated self-assembly steps. The hexagonal intermediates and the resulting self-assembled grid architectures were imaged at submolecular resolution by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Characterization (including by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy) enabled the unambiguous atomic-scale determination of fourteen hexagonal grid isomers. Metal-mediated self-assembly in solution typically leads to small two- and three-dimensional architectures on scales smaller than 10 nm, but now a series of large, discrete, two-dimensional supramolecular hexagonal grids have been prepared through a combination of intra- and intermolecular coordination interactions. These 20-nm-wide grids have been imaged at submolecular resolution using scanning tunnelling microscopy.

A designer enzyme for hydrazone and oxime formation featuring an unnatural catalytic aniline residue

Creating designer enzymes with the ability to catalyse abiological transformations is a formidable challenge. Efforts toward this goal typically consider only canonical amino acids in the initial design process. However, incorporating unnatural amino acids that feature uniquely reactive side chains could significantly expand the catalytic repertoire of designer enzymes. To explore the potential of such artificial building blocks for enzyme design, here we selected p-aminophenylalanine as a potentially novel catalytic residue. We demonstrate that the catalytic activity of the aniline side chain for hydrazone and oxime formation reactions is increased by embedding p-aminophenylalanine into the hydrophobic pore of the multidrug transcriptional regulator from Lactococcus lactis. Both the recruitment of reactants by the promiscuous binding pocket and a judiciously placed aniline that functions as a catalytic residue contribute to the success of the identified artificial enzyme. We anticipate that our design strategy will prove rewarding to significantly expand the catalytic repertoire of designer enzymes in the future. An enzyme in which a reactive unnatural amino acid functions as a catalytic residue has now been designed. Embedding an aniline side chain into the promiscuous binding pocket of a multidrug resistance regulator endowed the protein scaffold with new-to-nature activities for hydrazone and oxime formation.

Reversing conventional site-selectivity in C(sp3)–H bond activation

One of the core barriers to developing C–H activation reactions is the ability to distinguish between multiple C–H bonds that are nearly identical in terms of electronic properties and bond strengths. Through recognition of distance and molecular geometry, remote C(sp2)–H bonds have been selectively activated in the presence of proximate ones. Yet achieving such unconventional site selectivity with C(sp3)–H bonds remains a paramount challenge. Here we report a combination of a simple pyruvic acid-derived directing group and a 2-pyridone ligand that enables the preferential activation of the distal γ-C(sp3)–H bond over the proximate β-C(sp3)–H bonds for a wide range of alcohol-derived substrates. A competition experiment between the five- and six-membered cyclopalladation step, as well as kinetic experiments, demonstrate the feasibility of using geometric strain to reverse the conventional site selectivity in C(sp3)–H activation. Conventional regioselectivity in Pd-catalysed C(sp3)–H activation is dictated by the formation of a five-membered palladacycle. Now, it has been shown that the combination of a simple directing group and a 2-pyridone ligand favours six-membered cyclopalladation, demonstrating the feasibility of using geometric strain to reverse conventional site selectivity in these reactions.

Title: 
meta-Selective C–H arylation of phenols via regiodiversion of electrophilic aromatic substitution

Electrophilic aromatic substitution is among the most widely used mechanistic manifolds in organic chemistry. Access to certain substitution patterns is, however, precluded by intrinsic and immutable substituent effects that ultimately restrict the diversity of the benzenoid chemical space. Here we demonstrate that the established regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution can be overcome simply by diverting the key σ-complex intermediate towards otherwise inaccessible substitution products. This ‘regiodiversion’ strategy is realized through the development of a general and concise method for the meta-selective C–H arylation of sterically congested phenols. Consisting of a Bi(V)-mediated electrophilic arylation and a subsequent aryl migration/rearomatization, our process is orthogonal to conventional C–H activation and cross-coupling approaches, and does not require prefunctionalization of the substrate. Mechanistically informed applications in synthesis showcase its utility as a versatile and enabling route to highly functionalized, contiguously substituted aromatic building blocks that defy synthesis via existing methods. The strong regiochemical preferences of electrophilic aromatic substitution have played a key role in defining the diversity of accessible chemical space. Now, it has been shown that the electrophilic arylation of phenols can be achieved at the electronically disfavoured meta-position via a formal 1,2-migration of a key σ-complex intermediate.

Modular bismacycles for the selective C–H arylation of phenols and naphthols

Given the important role played by 2-hydroxybiaryls in organic, medicinal and materials chemistry, concise methods for the synthesis of this common motif are extremely valuable. In seeking to extend the lexicon of synthetic chemists in this regard, we have developed an expedient and general strategy for the ortho-arylation of phenols and naphthols using readily available boronic acids. Our methodology relies on in situ generation of a uniquely reactive Bi(v) arylating agent from a bench-stable Bi(iii) precursor via telescoped B–to–Bi transmetallation and oxidation. By exploiting reactivity that is orthogonal to conventional metal-catalysed manifolds, diverse aryl and heteroaryl partners can be rapidly coupled to phenols and naphthols under mild conditions. Following arylation, high-yielding recovery of the Bi(iii) precursor allows for its efficient re-use in subsequent reactions. Mechanistic interrogation of each key step of the methodology informs its practical application and provides fundamental insight into the underexploited reactivity of organobismuth compounds. Step-economic access to the biologically relevant 2-hydroxybiaryl motif represents a long-standing challenge in synthetic organic chemistry. Now, a bismuth-mediated oxidative arylation of phenols and naphthols with boronic acids has been developed — supported by experimental mechanistic insight — giving a direct and practical route to this valuable molecular architecture.

Title: 
Artificial muscle-like function from hierarchical supramolecular assembly of photoresponsive molecular motors

A striking feature of living systems is their ability to produce motility by amplification of collective molecular motion from the nanoscale up to macroscopic dimensions. Some of nature's protein motors, such as myosin in muscle tissue, consist of a hierarchical supramolecular assembly of very large proteins, in which mechanical stress induces a coordinated movement. However, artificial molecular muscles have often relied on covalent polymer-based actuators. Here, we describe the macroscopic contractile muscle-like motion of a supramolecular system (comprising 95% water) formed by the hierarchical self-assembly of a photoresponsive amphiphilic molecular motor. The molecular motor first assembles into nanofibres, which further assemble into aligned bundles that make up centimetre-long strings. Irradiation induces rotary motion of the molecular motors, and propagation and accumulation of this motion lead to contraction of the fibres towards the light source. This system supports large-amplitude motion, fast response, precise control over shape, as well as weight-lifting experiments in water and air. A centimetre-long string formed by the hierarchical self-assembly of a photoresponsive amphiphilic molecular motor — composed of 95 wt% of water — undergoes muscle-like contraction. Under irradiation, rotary motion at the molecular level is amplified through non-covalent interactions to sustain a fast macroscopic mechanical motion of large amplitude.

Different timescales during ultrafast stilbene isomerization in the gas and liquid phases revealed using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy

Directly contrasting ultrafast excited-state dynamics in the gas and liquid phases is crucial to understanding the influence of complex environments. Previous studies have often relied on different spectroscopic observables, rendering direct comparisons challenging. Here, we apply extreme-ultraviolet time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to both gaseous and liquid cis-stilbene, revealing the coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics that underlie its isomerization. Our measurements track the excited-state wave packets from excitation along the complete reaction path to the final products. We observe coherent excited-state vibrational dynamics in both phases of matter that persist to the final products, enabling the characterization of the branching space of the S1–S0 conical intersection. We observe a systematic lengthening of the relaxation timescales in the liquid phase and a red shift of the measured excited-state frequencies that is most pronounced for the complex reaction coordinate. These results characterize in detail the influence of the liquid environment on both electronic and structural dynamics during a complete photochemical transformation. The influence that liquid environments have on the ultrafast excited-state dynamics of molecules is poorly understood. Using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, the dynamics of the photoisomerization of stilbene in the gas and liquid phases have now been shown to be qualitatively similar—including the observation of vibrational coherences—but the timescales are significantly longer in the liquid phase.

Multi-site programmable functionalization of alkenes via controllable alkene isomerization

Direct and selective functionalization of hydrocarbon chains is a fundamental problem in synthetic chemistry. Conventional functionalization of C=C double bonds and C(sp3)–H bonds provides some solutions, but site diversity remains an issue. The merging of alkene isomerization with (oxidative) functionalization provides an ideal method for remote functionalization, which would provide more opportunities for site diversity. However, the reported functionalized sites are still limited and focus on a specific terminal position and internal site; new site-selective functionalization, including multi-functionalization, remains a largely unmet challenge. Here we describe a palladium-catalysed aerobic oxidative method for the multi-site programmable functionalization, involving the C=C double bond and multiple C(sp3)–H bonds, of terminal olefins via a strategy that controls the reaction sequence between alkene isomerization and oxidative functionalization. Specifically, 1-acetoxylation (anti-Markovnikov), 2-acetoxylation, 1,2-diacetoxylation and 1,2,3-triacetoxylation have been realized, accompanied by controllable remote alkenylation. This method enables available terminal olefins from petrochemical feedstocks to be readily converted into unsaturated alcohols and polyalcohols and particularly into different monosaccharides and C-glycosides. The diverse site-selective functionalization, including multi-functionalization, of C=C double bonds and C(sp3)–H bonds remains a largely unmet challenge. Now, a palladium-catalysed aerobic oxidative method has been developed for the multi-site programmable functionalization of terminal olefins via a strategy that controls the reaction sequence between alkene isomerization and oxidative functionalization.

Genome mining- and synthetic biology-enabled production of hypermodified peptides

The polytheonamides are among the most complex and biosynthetically distinctive natural products known to date. These potent peptide cytotoxins are derived from a ribosomal precursor processed by 49 mostly non-canonical posttranslational modifications. As the producer is a ‘microbial dark matter’ bacterium only distantly related to any cultivated organism, &gt;70-step chemical syntheses have been developed to access these unique compounds. Here, we mined prokaryotic diversity to establish a synthetic platform based on the new host Microvirgula aerodenitrificans that produces hypermodified peptides within two days. Using this system, we generated the aeronamides, new polytheonamide-type compounds with near-picomolar cytotoxicity. Aeronamides, as well as the polygeonamides produced from deep-rock biosphere DNA, contain the highest numbers of d-amino acids in known biomolecules. With increasing bacterial genomes being sequenced, similar host mining strategies might become feasible to access further elusive natural products from uncultivated life. Polytheonamides are potently cytotoxic hypermodified ribosomal peptides that are produced by an uncultivated bacterium. Now, a bioinformatic mining strategy has enabled the development of a bacterial production host that can be cultivated in a laboratory. The host generates polytheonamide-like compounds within 2 days, and can efficiently introduce multiple d-amino acids, asparagine N-methylations and C-methyl groups into various peptides.

Ring-through-ring molecular shuttling in a saturated [3]rotaxane

Mechanically interlocked molecules such as rotaxanes and catenanes comprise two or more components whose motion relative to each other can be controlled. A [2]rotaxane molecular shuttle, for example, consists of an axle bearing two recognition sites and a single macrocyclic wheel that can undergo a to-and-fro motion along the axle—shuttling between the recognition sites. The ability of mechanically interlocked molecules to undergo this type of large-amplitude change is the core mechanism behind almost every interlocked molecular switch or machine, including sophisticated mechanical systems such as a molecular elevator and a peptide synthesizer. Here, as a way to expand the scope of dynamics possible at the molecular level, we have developed a molecular shuttling mechanism involving the exchange of rings between two recognition sites in a saturated [3]rotaxane (one with no empty recognition sites). This was accomplished by passing a smaller ring through a larger one, thus achieving ring-through-ring molecular shuttling. Controlled motion in mechanically interlocked molecules, such as a macrocycle moving back and forth along the axle of a rotaxane, forms the basis of complex functions in molecular machinery. Now, ring-through-ring shuttling has been achieved using two macrocycles that switch position between two anchoring sites, which involves the smaller ring passing through the larger one.

Isolation and reactivity of an elusive diazoalkene

Most functional groups, especially those consisting of the abundant elements of organic matter—carbon, nitrogen and oxygen—have been extensively studied and only very few remain speculative due to their high intrinsic reactivity. In contrast to the well-explored chemistry of diazoalkanes (R2C=N2), diazoalkenes (R2C=C=N2) have been postulated in several organic transformations, but remain elusive long-sought intermediates. Here, we present a room-temperature stable diazoalkene, utilizing a dinitrogen transfer from nitrous oxide. This functional group shows dual-site nucleophilicity (C and N atoms) and features a bent C–C–N entity (124°) and a long N–N bond together with a remarkable low infrared absorption (1,944 cm–1). Substitution of N2 by an isocyanide leads to a vinylidene ketenimine. Furthermore, photochemically triggered loss of dinitrogen might proceed through a transient triplet vinylidene. We anticipate the existence of a stable diazoalkene functional group to pave an exciting avenue into the chemistry of low-valent carbon and unsaturated carbenes. Although diazoalkenes have been reported as reactive intermediates in organic chemistry, their detection and isolation remains challenging. Such species have previously only been detected at low temperatures in matrix-isolation studies. Now, a room-temperature stable diazoalkene has been reported, which shows dual-site nucleophilicity and can undergo N2 exchange or lose dinitrogen under irradiation.

Catalytic undirected borylation of tertiary C–H bonds in bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes

Catalytic borylations of sp3 C–H bonds occur with high selectivities for primary C–H bonds or secondary C–H bonds that are activated by nearby electron-withdrawing substituents. Catalytic borylation at tertiary C–H bonds has not been observed. Here we describe a broadly applicable method for the synthesis of boron-substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes and (hetero)bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes by an iridium-catalysed borylation of the bridgehead tertiary C–H bond. This reaction is highly selective for the formation of bridgehead boronic esters and is compatible with a broad range of functional groups (&gt;35 examples). The method is applicable to the late-stage modification of pharmaceuticals containing this substructure and the synthesis of novel bicyclic building blocks. Kinetic and computational studies suggest that C–H bond cleavage occurs with a modest barrier and that the turnover-limiting step of this reaction is an isomerization that occurs prior to reductive elimination that forms the C–B bond. Borylated bicyclopentanes and bicyclohexanes are valuable compounds in drug research but are difficult to prepare. Now, an iridium-catalysed method has been developed for the borylation of the bridgehead tertiary C–H bonds in bicyclopentanes and bicyclohexanes, providing access to a variety of highly decorated bicyclic cores.

Title: 
A versatile living polymerization method for aromatic amides

Polycondensation polymers typically follow step-growth kinetics assuming all functional groups are equally likely to react with one another. If the reaction rates with the chain end can be selectively accelerated, living polymers can be obtained. Here we report on two chlorophosphonium iodide reagents that have been synthesized from triphenylphosphine and tri(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphine. The former activates aromatic carboxylic acids as acid chlorides in the presence of secondary aromatic amines and the latter even in the presence of primary aromatic amines. These reagents allow p-aminobenzoic acid derivatives to form solution-stable activated monomers that polymerize in a living fashion in the presence of amine initiators. Other aryl amino acids and even dimers of aryl amino acids can be polymerized in a living fashion when slowly added to the phosphonium salt in the presence of an amine initiator. Diblock copolymers and triblock terpolymers of aryl amino acids can be prepared even in the presence of electrophilic functional groups. Two phosphine-based reagents can be used to prepare aromatic acid chlorides in the presence of either primary or secondary amines. This approach enables the living polycondensation of aromatic amino acids under mild conditions and can be used to make block copolymers as well as helical aromatic amide foldamers.

Photoswitchable gating of non-equilibrium enzymatic feedback in chemically communicating polymersome nanoreactors

The circadian rhythm generates out-of-equilibrium metabolite oscillations that are controlled by feedback loops under light/dark cycles. Here we describe a non-equilibrium nanosystem comprising a binary population of enzyme-containing polymersomes capable of light-gated chemical communication, controllable feedback and coupling to macroscopic oscillations. The populations consist of esterase-containing polymersomes functionalized with photo-responsive donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASA) and light-insensitive semipermeable urease-loaded polymersomes. The DASA–polymersome membrane becomes permeable under green light, switching on esterase activity and decreasing the pH, which in turn initiates the production of alkali in the urease-containing population. A pH-sensitive pigment that absorbs green light when protonated provides a negative feedback loop for deactivating the DASA–polymersomes. Simultaneously, increased alkali production deprotonates the pigment, reactivating esterase activity by opening the membrane gate. We utilize light-mediated fluctuations of pH to perform non-equilibrium communication between the nanoreactors and use the feedback loops to induce work as chemomechanical swelling/deswelling oscillations in a crosslinked hydrogel. We envision possible applications in artificial organelles, protocells and soft robotics. The circadian rhythm generates out-of-equilibrium metabolite oscillations controlled by feedback loops under light/dark cycles. Now, it has been shown that these life-like properties can emerge from a non-equilibrium nanosystem comprising a binary population of enzyme-containing polymersomes capable of light-gated chemical communication, controllable feedback and coupling to macroscopic oscillations.

A thiolate-bridged FeIVFeIV μ-nitrido complex and its hydrogenation reactivity toward ammonia formation

Iron nitrides are key intermediates in biological nitrogen fixation and the industrial Haber–Bosch process, used to form ammonia from dinitrogen. However, the proposed successive conversion of nitride to ammonia remains elusive. In this regard, the search for well-described multi-iron nitrido model complexes and investigations on controlling their reactivity towards ammonia formation have long been of great challenge and importance. Here we report a well-defined thiolate-bridged FeIVFeIV μ-nitrido complex featuring an uncommon bent Fe–N–Fe moiety. Remarkably, this complex shows excellent reactivity toward hydrogenation with H2 at ambient conditions, forming ammonia in high yield. Combined experimental and computational studies demonstrate that a thiolate-bridged FeIIIFeIII μ-amido complex is a key intermediate, which is generated through an unusual two-electron oxidation of H2. Moreover, ammonia production was also realized by treating this diiron μ-nitride with electrons and water as a proton source. Multi-iron nitrides are implicated as potential key intermediates in biological nitrogen fixation and the industrial Haber–Bosch process, but well-described functional model systems are rare. Now, a well-defined thiolate-bridged FeIVFeIV μ-nitrido complex has been found to show excellent reactivity toward hydrogenation with H2 through a stepwise pathway to form ammonia in high yield.

Spontaneous doping of the basal plane of MoS2 single layers through oxygen substitution under ambient conditions

The chemical inertness of the defect-free basal plane confers environmental stability to MoS2 single layers, but it also limits their chemical versatility and catalytic activity. The stability of pristine MoS2 basal plane against oxidation under ambient conditions is a widely accepted assumption however, here we report single-atom-level structural investigations that reveal that oxygen atoms spontaneously incorporate into the basal plane of MoS2 single layers during ambient exposure. The use of scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals a slow oxygen-substitution reaction, during which individual sulfur atoms are replaced one by one by oxygen, giving rise to solid-solution-type 2D MoS2−xOx crystals. Oxygen substitution sites present all over the basal plane act as single-atom reaction centres, substantially increasing the catalytic activity of the entire MoS2 basal plane for the electrochemical H2 evolution reaction. MoS2 single layers spontaneously undergo a slow oxygen substitution reaction under ambient conditions giving rise to solid-solution-type 2D molybdenum oxy-sulfide crystals. The oxygen substitution sites of the 2D MoS2−xOx crystals act as efficient single-atom catalytic centres for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Screening and characterization of a diverse panel of metagenomic imine reductases for biocatalytic reductive amination

Finding faster and simpler ways to screen protein sequence space to enable the identification of new biocatalysts for asymmetric synthesis remains both a challenge and a rate-limiting step in enzyme discovery. Biocatalytic strategies for the synthesis of chiral amines are increasingly attractive and include enzymatic asymmetric reductive amination, which offers an efficient route to many of these high-value compounds. Here we report the discovery of over 300 new imine reductases and the production of a large (384 enzymes) and sequence-diverse panel of imine reductases available for screening. We also report the development of a facile high-throughput screen to interrogate their activity. Through this approach we identified imine reductase biocatalysts capable of accepting structurally demanding ketones and amines, which include the preparative synthesis of N-substituted β-amino ester derivatives via a dynamic kinetic resolution process, with excellent yields and stereochemical purities. High-throughput biocatalytic screening and metagenomics have been used to discover over 300 imine reductases (IREDs) and subsequently produce a sequence-diverse panel of IREDs suitable for optimizing the synthesis of chiral amines. Additional characterization identified biocatalysts that accommodate structurally demanding amines and ketones for enzymatic reductive aminations.

Title: 
Sequencing abasic sites in DNA at single-nucleotide resolution

In DNA, the loss of a nucleobase by hydrolysis generates an abasic site. Formed as a result of DNA damage, as well as a key intermediate during the base excision repair pathway, abasic sites are frequent DNA lesions that can lead to mutations and strand breaks. Here we present snAP-seq, a chemical approach that selectively exploits the reactive aldehyde moiety at abasic sites to reveal their location within DNA at single-nucleotide resolution. Importantly, the approach resolves abasic sites from other aldehyde functionalities known to exist in genomic DNA. snAP-seq was validated on synthetic DNA and then applied to two separate genomes. We studied the distribution of thymine modifications in the Leishmania major genome by enzymatically converting these modifications into abasic sites followed by abasic site mapping. We also applied snAP-seq directly to HeLa DNA to provide a map of endogenous abasic sites in the human genome. Abasic sites are amongst the most common forms of DNA damage. Despite their biological significance, little is known regarding the distribution of these sites within DNA. Now a method to sequence abasic sites at single-nucleotide resolution has been developed. This method allows the location of abasic sites to be mapped genome-wide.

Title: 
Total synthesis of structurally diverse pleuromutilin antibiotics

The emergence of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens has placed renewed emphasis on the total chemical synthesis of novel antibacterials. Tetracyclines, macrolides, streptogramins and lincosamides are now accessible through flexible and general synthetic routes. Pleuromutilins (antibiotics based on the fungal metabolite pleuromutilin) have remained resistant to this approach, in large part due to the difficulties encountered in the de novo construction of the decahydro-3a,9-propanocyclopenta[8]annulene skeleton. Here we present a platform for the total synthesis of pleuromutilins that provides access to diverse derivatives bearing alterations at previously inaccessible skeletal and peripheral positions. The synthesis is enabled by the serendipitous discovery of a vinylogous Wolff rearrangement, which serves to establish the C9 quaternary centre in the targets, and the development of a highly diastereoselective butynylation of an α-quaternary aldehyde, which forms the C14 secondary alcohol. The versatility of the route is demonstrated through the synthesis of seventeen structurally distinct derivatives, with many possessing potent antibacterial activity. General synthetic methods to access pleuromutilin antibiotics are limited due to their complex carbocyclic skeleton. Now, a synthetic platform has been developed to access structurally diverse pleuromutilins with variations at the quaternary C12 position and hydrindanone cores. Seventeen structurally distinct derivatives were prepared and evaluated against a panel of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

Enantioselective α-functionalizations of ketones via allylic substitution of silyl enol ethers

The enantioselective construction of carbon–heteroatom and carbon–carbon bonds that are alpha to ketones leads to the formation of substructures that are ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Traditional methods to form such bonds have relied on combining ketone enolates with electrophiles. Reactions with heteroatom-based electrophiles require special reagents in which the heteroatom, which is typically nucleophilic, has been rendered electrophilic by changes to the oxidation state. The resulting products usually require post-synthetic transformations to unveil the functional group in the final desired products. Moreover, different catalytic systems are typically required for the reaction of different electrophiles. Here, we report a strategy for the formal enantioselective α-functionalization of ketones to form products containing a diverse array of substituents at the alpha position with a single catalyst. This strategy involves an unusual reversal of the role of the nucleophile and electrophile to form C–N, C–O, C–S and C–C bonds from a series of masked ketone electrophiles and a wide range of conventional heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles catalysed by a metallacyclic iridium catalyst. Typical methods for the enantioselective α-functionalizations of ketones join ketone enolate nucleophiles with carbon or heteroatom electrophiles. We report an umpolung strategy to achieve this transformation with masked ketone electrophiles and a wide range of conventional heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles catalysed by a metallacyclic iridium catalyst in high yield and enantioselectivity.

Title: 
Knotting a molecular strand can invert macroscopic effects of chirality

Transferring structural information from the nanoscale to the macroscale is a promising strategy for developing adaptive and dynamic materials. Here we demonstrate that the knotting and unknotting of a molecular strand can be used to control, and even invert, the handedness of a helical organization within a liquid crystal. An oligodentate tris(2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide) strand with six point-chiral centres folds into an overhand knot of single handedness upon coordination to lanthanide ions, both in isotropic solutions and in liquid crystals. In achiral liquid crystals, dopant knotted and unknotted strands induce supramolecular helical organizations of opposite handedness, with dynamic switching achievable through in situ knotting and unknotting events. Tying the molecular knot transmits information regarding asymmetry across length scales, from Euclidean point chirality (constitutional chirality) via molecular entanglement (conformation) to liquid-crystal (centimetre-scale) chirality. The magnitude of the effect induced by the tying of the molecular knots is similar to that famously used to rotate a glass rod on the surface of a liquid crystal by synthetic molecular motors. Reversible nanoscale knotting and unknotting of a molecular strand can be used to control the handedness of helical organizations at macroscopic length scales. Dopant knotted and unknotted strands induce supramolecular helical structures of opposite handedness in achiral liquid crystals, and the left- and right-handed forms can be switched in situ.

Tunable angle-dependent electrochemistry at twisted bilayer graphene with moiré flat bands

Tailoring electron transfer dynamics across solid–liquid interfaces is fundamental to the interconversion of electrical and chemical energy. Stacking atomically thin layers with a small azimuthal misorientation to produce moiré superlattices enables the controlled engineering of electronic band structures and the formation of extremely flat electronic bands. Here, we report a strong twist-angle dependence of heterogeneous charge transfer kinetics at twisted bilayer graphene electrodes with the greatest enhancement observed near the ‘magic angle’ (~1.1°). This effect is driven by the angle-dependent tuning of moiré-derived flat bands that modulate electron transfer processes with the solution-phase redox couple. Combined experimental and computational analysis reveals that the variation in electrochemical activity with moiré angle is controlled by a structural relaxation of the moiré superlattice at twist angles of &lt;2°, and ‘topological defect’ AA stacking regions, where flat bands are localized, produce a large anomalous local electrochemical enhancement that cannot be accounted for by the elevated local density of states alone. Controlling the crystallographic registry of layered materials through interlayer twist angles has introduced a distinctive degree of freedom for tuning their electronic behaviour. Now, the interfacial electrochemical kinetics of solution-phase redox complexes at twisted bilayer graphene electrodes have been modulated by the angle-dependent tuning of moiré-derived flat bands.

A marine viral halogenase that iodinates diverse substrates

Oceanic cyanobacteria are the most abundant oxygen-generating phototrophs on our planet and are therefore important to life. These organisms are infected by viruses called cyanophages, which have recently shown to encode metabolic genes that modulate host photosynthesis, phosphorus cycling and nucleotide metabolism. Herein we report the characterization of a wild-type flavin-dependent viral halogenase (VirX1) from a cyanophage. Notably, halogenases have been previously associated with secondary metabolism, tailoring natural products. Exploration of this viral halogenase reveals it capable of regioselective halogenation of a diverse range of substrates with a preference for forming aryl iodide species; this has potential implications for the metabolism of the infected host. Until recently, a flavin-dependent halogenase that is capable of iodination in vitro had not been reported. VirX1 is interesting from a biocatalytic perspective as it shows strikingly broad substrate flexibility and a clear preference for iodination, as illustrated by kinetic analysis. These factors together render it an attractive tool for synthesis. A flavin-dependent halogenase with a remarkable preference for iodination has now been discovered. The halogenase (VirX1) was discovered using a bioinformatics-based approach and comes from a cyanophage. Structural characterization and kinetic studies show that VirX1 possesses broad substrate tolerance, making it an attractive tool for synthesis.

Transition-metal-bridged bimetallic clusters with multiple uranium–metal bonds

Heterometallic clusters are important in catalysis and small-molecule activation because of the multimetallic synergistic effects from different metals. However, multimetallic species that contain uranium–metal bonds remain very scarce due to the difficulties in their synthesis. Here we present a straightforward strategy to construct a series of heterometallic clusters with multiple uranium–metal bonds. These complexes were created by facile reactions of a uranium precursor with Ni(COD)2 (COD, cyclooctadiene). The multimetallic clusters’ cores are supported by a heptadentate N4P3 scaffold. Theoretical investigations indicate the formation of uranium–nickel bonds in a U2Ni2 and a U2Ni3 species, but also show that they exhibit a uranium–uranium interaction; thus, the electronic configuration of uranium in these species is U(iii)-5f26d1. This study provides further understanding of the bonding between f-block elements and transition metals, which may allow the construction of d–f heterometallic clusters and the investigation of their potential applications. Heterometallic clusters have shown promise in catalysis and small-molecule activation, but species comprising uranium–metal bonds have remained difficult to synthesize. Now, facile reactions between uranium and nickel precursors have led to nickel-bridged diuranium clusters supported by a heptadentate N4P3 scaffold. Computational analysis points to an unusual electronic configuration for uranium, U(iii)-5f26d1.

Functional advantages of building nanosystems using multiple molecular components

Over half of all the natural nanomachines in living organisms are multimeric and likely exploit the self-assembly of their components to provide functional benefits. However, the advantages and disadvantages of building nanosystems using multiple molecular components remain relatively unexplored at the thermodynamic, kinetic and functional levels. In this study we used theory and a simple DNA-based model that forms the same nanostructures with different numbers of components to advance our knowledge in this area. Despite its lower assembly rate, we found that a system built with three components may undergo a more cooperative assembly transition from less preorganized components, which facilitates the emergence of functionalities. Using simple variations of its components, we also found that trimeric nanosystems display a much higher level of programmability than their dimeric counterparts because they can assemble with various levels of cooperativity, self-inhibition and time-dependent properties. We show here how two simple strategies (for example, cutting and adding components) can be employed to efficiently programme the regulatory function of a more complex, artificially selected, RNA-cleaving catalytic nanosystem. The advantages and disadvantages of building a nanosystem using one, two or more molecular components are poorly understood. Now, using structural and catalytic DNA-based nanosystems and theoretical simulations, it has been shown that the assembly of trimeric nanosystems displays much higher levels of programmability and functionality than the monomeric or dimeric counterparts.

Determining the nature of quantum resonances by probing elastic and reactive scattering in cold collisions

Scattering resonances play a central role in collision processes in physics and chemistry. They help build an intuitive understanding of the collision dynamics due to the spatial localization of the scattering wavefunctions. For resonances that are localized in the reaction region, located at short separation behind the centrifugal barrier, sharp peaks in the reaction rates are the characteristic signature, observed recently with state-of-the-art experiments in low-energy collisions. If, however, the localization occurs outside of the reaction region, mostly the elastic scattering is modified. This may occur due to above-barrier resonances, the quantum analogue of classical orbiting. By probing both elastic and inelastic scattering of metastable helium with deuterium molecules in merged-beam experiments, we differentiate between the nature of quantum resonances—tunnelling resonances versus above-barrier resonances—and corroborate our findings by calculating the corresponding scattering wavefunctions. Low-temperature scattering leads to the formation of quantum resonances or quasi-bound states, which are observable as peaks in the measured collision cross-sections. Now it has been shown that two different formation mechanisms, quantum tunnelling and quantum reflection, can be distinguished by measuring and comparing elastic and inelastic scattering, which probe the spatial localization of the resonance wavefunctions.

Distinct thermodynamic signatures of oligomer generation in the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide

Mapping free-energy landscapes has proved to be a powerful tool for studying reaction mechanisms. Many complex biomolecular assembly processes, however, have remained challenging to access using this approach, including the aggregation of peptides and proteins into amyloid fibrils implicated in a range of&nbsp;disorders. Here, we generalize the strategy used to probe free-energy landscapes in protein folding to determine the activation energies and entropies that characterize each of the molecular steps in the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ42), which is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Our results reveal that interactions between monomeric Aβ42 and amyloid fibrils during fibril-dependent&nbsp;secondary nucleation fundamentally reverse the thermodynamic signature of this process relative to primary nucleation, even though both processes generate aggregates from soluble peptides. By mapping the energetic and entropic contributions along the reaction&nbsp;trajectories, we show that the catalytic efficiency of Aβ42 fibril surfaces results from the enthalpic stabilization of adsorbing peptides in conformations amenable to nucleation, resulting in&nbsp;a dramatic lowering of the activation energy for nucleation. Mapping energy landscapes has proved to be a powerful approach for studying reaction mechanisms. Now, this strategy has been applied to determine the activation energies and entropies that characterize the molecular steps in the misfolding and aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide, revealing striking differences between the thermodynamic signatures of primary and secondary nucleation.

Synthesis and characterization of crystalline niobium and tantalum carbonyl complexes at room temperature

A variety of homoleptic transition metal carbonyl complexes are known as bulk compounds for group 7–12 metals. These metals typically feature a maximum of 6 CO ligands to form complexes with 18 valence electrons. In contrast, group 3–5 metals, with fewer valence electrons, have been shown to form highly coordinated heptacarbonyl and octacarbonyl complexes—although they were only identified by gas-phase mass spectrometry and/or matrix isolation spectroscopy work. Now we have prepared heptacarbonyl cations of niobium and tantalum as crystalline salts that are stable at room temperature. The [M(CO)7]+ (M = Nb or Ta) complexes were formed by the oxidation of [M(CO)6]– with 2Ag+[Al(ORF)4]– (RF, C(CF3)3) under a CO atmosphere; their experimental characterization was supported by density functional theory calculations. Other unusual carbonyl compounds were also synthesized: two isostructural salts that contained the 84-valence-electron cluster cation [Ag6{Nb(CO)6}4]2+, the piano-stool complexes [(1,2-F2C6H4)M(CO)4]+ and two polymorphs of neutral Ta2(CO)12 with a long, unsupported Ta–Ta bond. In contrast to the variety of stable carbonyl complexes of group 7–12 metals, few are known for group 3–5 metals; among those, cations have only been identified in the gas phase or by matrix isolation. Now, several unusual niobium and tantalum carbonyl compounds have been prepared as bulk crystalline compounds, including heptacarbonyl salts and the neutral ditantalum dodecacarbonyl.

Synthesis of bilayer borophene

As the nearest-neighbour element to carbon, boron is theoretically predicted to have a planar two-dimensional form, named borophene, with novel properties, such as Dirac fermions and superconductivity. Several polymorphs of monolayer borophene have been grown on metal surfaces, yet thicker bilayer and few-layer nanosheets remain elusive. Here we report the synthesis of large-size, single-crystalline bilayer borophene on the Cu(111) surface by molecular beam epitaxy. Combining scanning tunnelling microscopy and first-principles calculations, we show that bilayer borophene consists of two stacked monolayers that are held together by covalent interlayer boron–boron bonding, and each monolayer has β12-like structures with zigzag rows. The formation of a bilayer is associated with a large transfer and redistribution of charge in the first boron layer on Cu(111), which provides additional electrons for the bonding of additional boron atoms, enabling the growth of the second layer. The bilayer borophene is shown to possess metallic character, and be less prone to being oxidized than its monolayer counterparts. Several polymorphs of borophene have been synthesized on metal substrates, but typically as monolayers. Now large-size, single-crystalline bilayer borophene has been grown on Cu(111)—a sufficient electron provider to enable the bonding of the second boron layer. The resulting bilayer possesses a metallic character and is less susceptible to oxidation than its monolayer counterpart.

Halogen-bond-assisted radical activation of glycosyl donors enables mild and stereoconvergent 1,2-cis-glycosylation

The chemistry of carbohydrates has a history of over 100 years, but simple, stereoselective and efficient glycosylation methods remain highly needed to facilitate the studies of sugars in various disciplines. Here we report a strategy for 1,2-cis-glycosylation without using metals, strong (Lewis) acids, elaborate catalysts or labile substrates. Our method operates by a unique mechanism: it activates glycosyl donors through a radical cascade rather than the conventional acid-promoted, ionic process. As elucidated by computational and experimental studies, the allyl glycosyl sulfones (as donors) form halogen bond complexes with perfluoroalkyl iodides, which—merely by visible light irradiation—fragment via radical intermediates to give the electrophilic glycosyl iodides. In situ trapping by various nucleophiles affords, in a stereoconvergent manner, the challenging 1,2-cis-glycosides. This metal- and acid-free reaction shows remarkable tolerance to functional groups. The high stereoselectivity holds for a broad array of donors. This study suggests that the simple C2-alkoxy group can serve as an effective directing group for building 1,2-cis-glycosidic bonds. Most chemical glycosylation methods operate by acid-promoted, ionic activation of donors. Now, by exploiting the formation of a halogen-bond complex, the activation of glycosyl donors was achieved via a visible light-promoted radical cascade process, resulting in a general, simple and mild way to build challenging 1,2-cis-glycosidic bonds.

Title: 
A general strategy to develop cell permeable and fluorogenic probes for multicolour nanoscopy

Live-cell fluorescence nanoscopy is a powerful tool to study cellular biology on a molecular scale, yet its use is held back by the paucity of suitable fluorescent probes. Fluorescent probes based on regular fluorophores usually suffer from a low cell permeability and an unspecific background signal. Here we report a general strategy to transform regular fluorophores into fluorogenic probes with an excellent cell permeability and a low unspecific background signal. Conversion of a carboxyl group found in rhodamines and related fluorophores into an electron-deficient amide does not affect the spectroscopic properties of the fluorophore, but allows us to rationally tune the dynamic equilibrium between two different forms: a fluorescent zwitterion and a non-fluorescent, cell-permeable spirolactam. Furthermore, the equilibrium generally shifts towards the fluorescent form when the probe binds to its cellular targets. The resulting increase in fluorescence can be up to 1,000-fold. Using this simple design principle, we created fluorogenic probes in various colours for different cellular targets for wash-free, multicolour, live-cell nanoscopy. It is difficult to develop suitable fluorescent probes for live-cell nanoscopy, but a general strategy is now reported that can transform regular fluorophores into fluorogenic probes with excellent cell permeability and low unspecific background signals. Using this approach, probes in a variety of colours were developed for different cellular targets and used for wash-free, multicolour, live-cell confocal and STED microscopy.

Light-activated tetrazines enable precision live-cell bioorthogonal chemistry

Bioorthogonal cycloaddition reactions between tetrazines and strained dienophiles are widely used for protein, lipid and glycan labelling because of their extremely rapid kinetics. However, controlling this chemistry in the presence of living mammalian cells with a high degree of spatial and temporal precision remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate a versatile approach to light-activated formation of tetrazines from photocaged dihydrotetrazines. Photouncaging, followed by spontaneous transformation to reactive tetrazine, enables live-cell spatiotemporal control of rapid bioorthogonal cycloaddition with dienophiles such as trans-cyclooctenes. Photocaged dihydrotetrazines are stable in conditions that normally degrade tetrazines, enabling efficient early-stage incorporation of bioorthogonal handles into biomolecules such as peptides. Photocaged dihydrotetrazines allow the use of non-toxic light to trigger tetrazine ligations on living mammalian cells. By tagging reactive phospholipids with fluorophores, we demonstrate modification of HeLa cell membranes with single-cell spatial resolution. Finally, we show that photo-triggered therapy is possible by coupling tetrazine photoactivation with strategies that release prodrugs in response to tetrazine ligation. Developing stimuli-responsive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligations remains highly challenging, but a versatile approach that uses photocaged dihydrotetrazines has now been developed. Photouncaging results in the spontaneous formation of reactive tetrazines that rapidly react with dienophiles such as trans-cyclooctenes. As a demonstration, the method was used for live-cell labelling with single-cell precision and light-triggered drug delivery.

Single nucleotide translation without ribosomes

The translation of messenger RNA sequences into polypeptide sequences according to the genetic code is central to life. How this process, which relies on the ribosomal machinery, arose from much simpler precursors is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that single nucleotides charged with an amino acid couple with amino acids linked to the 5′-terminus of an RNA primer in reactions directed by the nucleotides of an RNA template in dilute aqueous solution at 0 °C. When a mixture of U-Val, A-Gly and G-Leu competed for coupling to Gly-RNA, base pairing dictated which dipeptide sequence formed preferentially. The resulting doubly anchored dipeptides can retain their link to the primer for further extension or can be fully released under mild acidic conditions. These results show that a single-nucleotide-based form of translation exists that requires no more than oligoribonucleotides and anchored amino acids. Elucidating the origin of translation—the process that produces a specific peptide from an RNA sequence—is one of the most difficult challenges in prebiotic chemistry and evolutionary biology. Now, it has been shown that aminoacylated nucleotides couple to amino-acid-bearing oligoribonucleotides, directed by an RNA template, forming specific di- and tripeptides in the absence of ribosomal machinery.

Evolving artificial metalloenzymes via random mutagenesis

Random mutagenesis has the potential to optimize the efficiency and selectivity of protein catalysts without requiring detailed knowledge of protein structure; however, introducing synthetic metal cofactors complicates the expression and screening of enzyme libraries, and activity arising from free cofactor must be eliminated. Here we report an efficient platform to create and screen libraries of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) via random mutagenesis, which we use to evolve highly selective dirhodium cyclopropanases. Error-prone PCR and combinatorial codon mutagenesis enabled multiplexed analysis of random mutations, including at sites distal to the putative ArM active site that are difficult to identify using targeted mutagenesis approaches. Variants that exhibited significantly improved selectivity for each of the cyclopropane product enantiomers were identified, and higher activity than previously reported ArM cyclopropanases obtained via targeted mutagenesis was also observed. This improved selectivity carried over to other dirhodium-catalysed transformations, including N–H, S–H and Si–H insertion, demonstrating that ArMs evolved for one reaction can serve as starting points to evolve catalysts for others. Proteins have the potential to serve as powerful scaffolds that control the catalytic activity and selectivity of organometallic centres; however, new methods are needed to optimize artificial metalloenzymes. Now, an efficient approach for evolving the activity and selectivity of artificial metalloenzymes has been demonstrated using dirhodium cyclopropanases. This approach does not require structural or mechanistic data to guide mutagenesis.

Enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric indoles via iron-catalysed oxidative cross-coupling

Heterobiaryl compounds that exhibit axial chirality are of increasing value and interest across several fields, but direct oxidative methods for their enantioselective synthesis remain elusive. Here we disclose that an iron catalyst in the presence of a chiral PyBOX ligand and an oxidant enables direct coupling between naphthols and indoles to yield atropisomeric heterobiaryl compounds with high levels of enantioselectivity. The reaction exhibits remarkable chemoselectivity and exclusively yields cross-coupled products without competing homocoupling. Mechanistic investigations enable us to postulate that an indole radical is generated in the reaction but that this is probably an off-cycle event, and that the reaction proceeds through formation of a chiral Fe-bound naphthoxy radical that is trapped by a nucleophilic indole. We envision that this simple, cheap and sustainable catalytic manifold will facilitate access to a range of heterobiaryl compounds and enable their application across the fields of materials science, medicinal chemistry and catalysis. Direct oxidative methods for the enantioselective synthesis of heterobiaryl compounds that exhibit axial chirality remain elusive. Now, the use of an iron catalyst in the presence of a chiral PyBOX ligand and an oxidant enables the direct coupling of naphthols and indoles with high levels of enantio- and cross-selectivity.

Oxidation of sulfur dioxide by nitrogen dioxide accelerated at the interface of deliquesced aerosol particles

Although the multiphase chemistry of SO2 in aerosol particles is of great importance to air quality under polluted haze conditions, a fundamental understanding of the pertinent mechanisms and kinetics is lacking. In particular, there is considerable debate on the importance of NO2 in the oxidation of SO2 in aerosol particles. Here experiments with atmospherically relevant deliquesced particles at buffered pH values of 4–5 show that the effective rate constant for the reaction of NO2 with SO32− ((1.4 ± 0.5) × 1010 M−1 s−1) is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the value in dilute solutions. An interfacial reaction at the surface of aerosol particles probably drives the very fast kinetics. Our results indicate that oxidation of SO2 by NO2 at aerosol surfaces may be an important source of sulfate aerosols under polluted haze conditions. In polluted atmospheres, NO2 oxidation of SO2 in particles is a potentially important reaction leading to sulfate aerosol formation. Now it has been shown that the reaction occurs much faster than predicted by known bulk solution chemistry, implicating an interfacial mechanism.

Deep-neural-network solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation

The electronic Schrödinger equation can only be solved analytically for the hydrogen atom, and the numerically exact full configuration-interaction method is exponentially expensive in the number of electrons. Quantum Monte Carlo methods are a possible way out: they scale well for large molecules, they can be parallelized and their accuracy has, as yet, been only limited by the flexibility of the wavefunction ansatz used. Here we propose PauliNet, a deep-learning wavefunction ansatz that achieves nearly exact solutions of the electronic Schrödinger equation for molecules with up to 30 electrons. PauliNet has a multireference Hartree–Fock solution built in as a baseline, incorporates the physics of valid wavefunctions and is trained using variational quantum Monte Carlo. PauliNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art variational ansatzes for atoms, diatomic molecules and a strongly correlated linear H10, and matches the accuracy of highly specialized quantum chemistry methods on the transition-state energy of cyclobutadiene, while being computationally efficient. High-accuracy quantum chemistry methods struggle with a combinatorial explosion of Slater determinants in larger molecular systems, but now a method has been developed that learns electronic wavefunctions with deep neural networks and reaches high accuracy with only a few determinants. The method is applicable to realistic chemical processes such as the automerization of cyclobutadiene.

O-GlcNAcylation modulates liquid–liquid phase separation of SynGAP/PSD-95

Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of SynGAP and PSD-95, two abundant proteins that interact in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons, has been implicated in modulating SynGAP PSD enrichment in excitatory synapses. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we report that O-GlcNAcylation of SynGAP acts as a suppressor of LLPS of the SynGAP/PSD-95 complex. We identified multiple O-GlcNAc modification sites for the endogenous SynGAP isolated from rat brain and the recombinantly expressed protein. Protein semisynthesis was used to generate site-specifically O-GlcNAcylated forms of SynGAP, and in vitro and cell-based LLPS assays demonstrated that T1306 O-GlcNAc of SynGAP blocks the interaction with PSD-95, thus inhibiting LLPS. Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylation suppresses SynGAP/PSD-95 LLPS in a dominant-negative manner, enabling sub-stoichiometric O-GlcNAcylation to exert effective regulation. We also showed that O-GlcNAc-dependent LLPS is reversibly regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). These findings demonstrate that OGT- and OGA-catalysed O-GlcNAc cycling may serve as an LLPS-regulating post-translational modification. SynGAP and PSD-95 are two abundant proteins that form a complex and undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the postsynaptic density of neurons. Now, O-GlcNAcylation of SynGAP has been found to suppress LLPS of the SynGAP/PSD-95 complex, and O-GlcNAc-dependent LLPS was also shown to be dynamically regulated by the enzymes O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase.

Design of catalysts for site-selective and enantioselective functionalization of non-activated primary C–H bonds

C–H functionalization represents a promising approach for the synthesis of complex molecules. Instead of relying on modifying the functional groups present in a molecule, the synthetic sequence is achieved by carrying out selective reactions on the C–H bonds, which traditionally would have been considered to be the unreactive components of a molecule. A major challenge is to design catalysts to control both the site- and stereoselectivity of the C–H functionalization. We have been developing dirhodium catalysts with different selectivity profiles in C–H functionalization reactions with donor/acceptor carbenes as reactive intermediates. Here we describe a new dirhodium catalyst capable of the functionalization of non-activated primary C–H bonds with high levels of site selectivity and enantioselectivity. Catalyst-controlled site selectivity without relying on the influence of a directing group within the substrate is a major challenge in C–H functionalization. Now a catalyst is described that selectively functionalizes non-activated primary C–H bonds in the presence of a variety of other C–H bonds and functional groups.

DNA-imprinted polymer nanoparticles with monodispersity and prescribed DNA-strand patterns

As colloidal self-assembly increasingly approaches the complexity of natural systems, an ongoing challenge is to generate non-centrosymmetric structures. For example, patchy, Janus or living crystallization particles have significantly advanced the area of polymer assembly. It has remained difficult, however, to devise polymer particles that associate in a directional manner, with controlled valency and recognition motifs. Here, we present a method to transfer DNA patterns from a DNA cage to a polymeric nanoparticle encapsulated inside the cage in three dimensions. The resulting DNA-imprinted particles (DIPs), which are ‘moulded’ on the inside of the DNA cage, consist of a monodisperse crosslinked polymer core with a predetermined pattern of different DNA strands covalently ‘printed’ on their exterior, and further assemble with programmability and directionality. The number, orientation and sequence of DNA strands grafted onto the polymeric core can be controlled during the process, and the strands are addressable independently of each other. DNA–polymer conjugates are attractive materials that combine the programmability of nucleic acid assembly with polymer functionality. Now, through a DNA cube template, monodisperse polymer particles have been imprinted with several DNA strands in pre-designed orientations— each independently set and addressable. The resulting hybrid particles can further assemble into well-defined, non-centrosymmetric structures.

Real-time monitoring of reaction stereochemistry through single-molecule observations of chirality-induced spin selectivity

Stereochemistry has an essential role in organic synthesis, biological catalysis and physical processes. In situ chirality identification and asymmetric synthesis are non-trivial tasks, especially for single-molecule systems. However, going beyond the chiral characterization of a large number of molecules (which inevitably leads to ensemble averaging) is crucial for elucidating the different properties induced by the chiral nature of the molecules. Here we report direct monitoring of chirality variations during a Michael addition followed by proton transfer and keto–enol tautomerism in a single molecule. Taking advantage of the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect, continuous current measurements through a single-molecule junction revealed in situ chirality variations during the reaction. Chirality identification at a high sensitivity level provides a promising tool for the study of symmetry-breaking reactions and sheds light on the origin of the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect itself. In situ chirality identification for single-molecule systems is not a straightforward task. Now, real-time chirality identification during a Michael addition reaction has been realized by continuous measurements of spin-polarized currents through a single-molecule junction, providing a promising method for studying symmetry-breaking reactions.

Total synthesis of brevianamide A

The fungal-derived bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane alkaloids are of interest to the scientific community for their potent and varied biological activities. Within this large and diverse family of natural products, the insecticidal metabolite (+)-brevianamide A is particularly noteworthy for its synthetic intractability and inexplicable biogenesis. Despite five decades of research, this alkaloid has remained an elusive target for chemical synthesis due to insurmountable issues of reactivity and selectivity associated with all previously explored strategies. We herein report the chemical synthesis of (+)-brevianamide A (seven steps, 7.2% overall yield, 750 mg scale), which involves a bioinspired cascade transformation of the linearly fused (−)-dehydrobrevianamide E into the topologically complex bridged-spiro-fused structure of (+)-brevianamide A. Despite five decades of research, the alkaloid (+)-brevianamide A has remained an elusive target for chemical synthesis. Now, it has been shown that the total synthesis of (+)-brevianamide A can be achieved in seven steps and 7.2% overall yield to give 750 mg of the target compound.

Isomerization of bioactive acylhydrazones triggered by light or thiols

The acylhydrazone unit is well represented in screening databases used to find ligands for biological targets, and numerous bioactive acylhydrazones have been reported. However, potential E/Z isomerization of the C=N bond in these compounds is rarely examined when bioactivity is assayed. Here we analysed two ortho-hydroxylated acylhydrazones discovered in a virtual drug screen for modulators of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and other bioactive hydroxylated acylhydrazones with structurally defined targets reported in the Protein Data Bank. We found that ionized forms of these compounds, which are populated under laboratory conditions, photoisomerize readily and the isomeric forms have markedly different bioactivity. Furthermore, we show that glutathione, a tripeptide involved with cellular redox balance, catalyses dynamic E⇄Z isomerization of acylhydrazones. The ratio of E to Z isomers in cells is determined by the relative stabilities of the isomers regardless of which isomer was applied. We conclude that E/Z isomerization may be a common feature of the bioactivity observed with acylhydrazones and should be routinely analysed. Acylhydrazones are often found in compounds across screening databases, and numerous bioactive acylhydrazones exist. This functional group can isomerize between E and Z in response to light or upon exposure to thiols. Now, E/Z isomerization is found to impact activities of bioactive acylhydrazones and should be routinely analysed.

On-surface synthesis and characterization of individual polyacetylene chains

Polyacetylene (PA) comprises one-dimensional chains of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms that may take a cis or trans configuration. Owing to its simple chemical structure and exceptional electronic properties, PA is an ideal system to understand the nature of charge transport in conducting polymers. Here, we report the on-surface synthesis of both cis- and trans-PA chains and their atomic-scale characterization. The structure of individual PA chains was imaged by non-contact atomic force microscopy, which confirmed the formation of PA by resolving single chemical bond units. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy suggests a semiconductor-to-metal transition through doping-induced suppression of the Peierls bond alternation of trans-PA on Cu(110). Electronically decoupled trans-PAs exhibit a band gap of 2.4 eV following copper oxide intercalation. Our study provides a platform for studying individual PA chains in real and reciprocal space, which may be further extended to study the intrinsic properties of non-linear excitons in conducting polymers. Polyacetylene is an ideal system to probe to gain a better understanding of the nature of charge transport in conducting polymers. Now, individual atomically precise polyacetylene chains have been synthesized on a copper surface and characterized using a range of techniques, revealing a doping-induced semiconductor-to-metal transition.

Standardized excitable elements for scalable engineering of far-from-equilibrium chemical networks

Engineered far-from-equilibrium synthetic chemical networks that pulse or switch states in response to environmental signals could precisely regulate the kinetics of chemical synthesis or self-assembly. Currently, such networks must be extensively tuned to compensate for the different activities of and unintended reactions between a network’s various chemical components. Modular elements with standardized performance could be used to rapidly construct networks with designed functions. Here we develop standardized excitable chemical regulatory elements, termed genelets, and use them to construct complex in vitro transcriptional networks. We develop a protocol for identifying &gt;15 interchangeable genelet elements with uniform performance and minimal crosstalk. These elements can be combined to engineer feedforward and feedback modules whose dynamics match those predicted by a simple kinetic model. Modules can then be rationally integrated and organized into networks that produce tunable temporal pulses and act as multistate switchable memories. Standardized genelet elements, and the workflow to identify more, should make engineering complex far-from-equilibrium chemical dynamics routine. Synthetic chemical networks with far-from-equilibrium dynamics akin to genetic regulatory networks in living cells could precisely regulate the kinetics of chemical synthesis or self-assembly. Now standardized excitable chemical regulatory elements, termed genelets, that enable predictive bottom-up construction of in vitro networks with designed temporal and multistable behaviour have been developed.

Mechanism of mediated alkali peroxide oxidation and triplet versus singlet oxygen formation

Aprotic alkali metal–O2 batteries face two major obstacles to their chemistry occurring efficiently, the insulating nature of the formed alkali superoxides/peroxides and parasitic reactions that are caused by the highly reactive singlet oxygen (1O2). Redox mediators are recognized to be key for improving rechargeability. However, it is unclear how they affect 1O2 formation, which hinders strategies for their improvement. Here we clarify the mechanism of mediated peroxide and superoxide oxidation and thus explain how redox mediators either enhance or suppress 1O2 formation. We show that charging commences with peroxide oxidation to a superoxide intermediate and that redox potentials above ~3.5 V versus Li/Li+ drive 1O2 evolution from superoxide oxidation, while disproportionation always generates some 1O2. We find that 1O2 suppression requires oxidation to be faster than the generation of 1O2 from disproportionation. Oxidation rates decrease with growing driving force following Marcus inverted-region behaviour, establishing a region of maximum rate. Redox mediators are important for improving the rechargeability of metal–air batteries, however, how they affect singlet oxygen formation and hence parasitic chemistry is unclear, hindering strategies for their improvement. Now, the mechanism of mediated peroxide and superoxide oxidation is elucidated, explaining how redox mediators either enhance or suppress singlet oxygen formation.

Structure–performance descriptors and the role of Lewis acidity in the methanol-to-propylene process

The combination of well-defined acid sites, shape-selective properties and outstanding stability places zeolites among the most practically relevant heterogeneous catalysts. The development of structure–performance descriptors for processes that they catalyse has been a matter of intense debate, both in industry and academia, and the direct conversion of methanol to olefins is a prototypical system in which various catalytic functions contribute to the overall performance. Propylene selectivity and resistance to coking are the two most important parameters in developing new methanol-to-olefin catalysts. Here, we present a systematic investigation on the effect of acidity on the performance of the zeolite ‘ZSM-5’ for the production of propylene. Our results demonstrate that the isolation of Brønsted acid sites is key to the selective formation of propylene. Also, the introduction of Lewis acid sites prevents the formation of coke, hence drastically increasing catalyst lifetime. As of yet, no clear structure–performance descriptors have been developed to tune the catalytic activity of zeolitic methanol-to-olefin catalysts. Now it has been shown that introducing Lewis acidity into Brønsted acidic zeolites boosts their performance. Although Brønsted acidity is found to define propylene selectivity, Lewis acidity is responsible for prolonging lifetime.

An isolable germylyne radical with a one-coordinate germanium atom

Carbynes (R– $${{{\dot{\mathrm C:}}}}$$ ), species that bear a monovalent carbon atom with three non-bonding valence electrons, are important intermediates and potentially useful in organic synthetic chemistry. However, free species of the type R– $${{{\dot{\mathrm E:}}}}$$ of any group 14 element (E) have eluded isolation in the condensed phase due to their high reactivity. Here we report the isolation, characterization and reactivity of a crystalline germylyne radical by using a sterically hindered hydrindacene ligand. The germylyne radical bears an essentially one-coordinate germanium atom as shown by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations show that the germylyne radical features a doublet ground state, and the three non-bonding valence electrons at the germanium atom contribute to the lone pair of electrons as the highest occupied molecular orbital-3 and one unpaired electron as the singly occupied molecular orbital. Heavy analogues of carbynes of the type R– $${{{\dot{\mathrm E:}}}}$$ , where E is a group 14 element, are difficult to isolate in the condensed phase due to their high reactivity. Now, a germylyne radical supported by a sterically hindered hydrindacene ligand has been prepared and structurally characterized. Theoretical calculations show that the spin density mainly resides at the germanium centre.

Interface-mediated noble metal deposition on transition metal dichalcogenide nanostructures

Functionalizing the surfaces of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets with noble metals is important for electrically contacting them to devices, as well as improving their catalytic and sensing capabilities. Solution-phase deposition provides a scalable approach to the creation of metal–TMD hybrid systems, but controlling such processes remains challenging. Here we elucidate the different pathways by which gold and silver deposit at room temperature onto colloidal 1T-WS2, 2H-WS2, 2H-MoSe2, 2H-WSe2, 1T′-MoTe2 and Td-WTe2 few-layer nanostructures to produce several distinct classes of 0D–2D and 2D–2D metal–TMD hybrids. Uniform gold nanoparticles form on all of the TMDs. By contrast, silver deposits as nanoparticles with a bimodal size distribution on the disulfides and diselenides, and as atomically thin layers on the ditellurides. The various sizes and morphologies of these surface-bound metal species arise from the relative strengths of the interfacial metal–chalcogen bonds during the reduction of Au3+ or Ag+ by the TMDs. The deposition of noble metals onto two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is crucial for practical applications, including in catalysis and sensing, yet this process has remained difficult to control. Now, gold and silver have been shown to grow on colloidal transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets into either atomically thin layers or nanoparticles whose sizes and morphologies depend on the relative strengths of the interfacial noble metal–chalcogen bonds.

Enantioselective C(sp3)–C(sp3) cross-coupling of non-activated alkyl electrophiles via nickel hydride catalysis

Cross-coupling of two alkyl fragments is an efficient method to produce organic molecules rich in sp3-hybridized carbon centres, which are attractive candidate compounds in drug discovery. Enantioselective C(sp3)–C(sp3) coupling is challenging, especially of alkyl electrophiles without an activating group (aryl, vinyl, carbonyl). Here, we report a strategy based on nickel hydride addition to internal olefins followed by nickel-catalysed alkyl–alkyl coupling. This strategy enables the enantioselective cross-coupling of non-activated alkyl halides with alkenyl boronates to produce chiral alkyl boronates. Employing readily available and stable olefins as pro-chiral nucleophiles, the coupling proceeds under mild conditions and exhibits broad scope and high functional-group tolerance. Applications for the functionalization of natural products and drug molecules, as well as the synthesis of chiral building blocks and a key intermediate to (S)-(+)-pregabalin, are demonstrated. Methods for producing organic molecules rich in sp3-hybridized carbon centres can be particularly useful for drug development. Now, it has been shown that the enantioselective cross-coupling of non-activated alkyl halides with alkenyl boronates enables the synthesis of chiral alkyl boronates. The reaction proceeds via nickel hydride insertion into an internal alkene followed by nickel-catalysed alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling.

Dynamic actuation of glassy polymersomes through isomerization of a single azobenzene unit at the block copolymer interface

Nature has engineered exquisitely responsive systems where molecular-scale information is transferred across an interface and propagated over long length scales. Such systems rely on multiple interacting, signalling and adaptable molecular and supramolecular networks that are built on dynamic, non-equilibrium structures. Comparable synthetic systems are still in their infancy. Here, we demonstrate that the light-induced actuation of a molecularly thin interfacial layer, assembled from a hydrophilic-azobenzene-hydrophobic diblock copolymer, can result in a reversible, long-lived perturbation of a robust glassy membrane across a range of over 500 chemical bonds. We show that the out-of-equilibrium actuation is caused by the photochemical trans–cis isomerization of the azo group, a single chemical functionality, in the middle of the interfacial layer. The principles proposed here are implemented in water-dispersed nanocapsules, and have implications for on-demand release of embedded cargo molecules. Biological systems are made up of complex networks that can respond to stimuli and function across relatively long distances in molecular terms. Now, it has been shown that a local disruption (the isomerization of just a single azobenzene unit) at the interface of supramolecular glassy polymersomes can immediately spread through over 500 bonds, significantly changing membrane permeability and enabling controllable release of guest molecules.

Recyclable and malleable thermosets enabled by activating dormant dynamic linkages

Chemical recycling of polymers is critical for improving the circular economy of plastics and environmental sustainability. Traditional thermoset polymers have generally been considered permanently crosslinked materials that are difficult or impossible to recycle. Herein, we demonstrate that by activating ‘dormant’ covalent bonds, traditional polycyanurate thermosets can be recycled into the original monomers, which can be circularly reused for their original purpose. Through retrosynthetic analysis, we redirected the synthetic route from forming conventional C–N bonds via irreversible cyanate trimerization to forming the C–O bonds through reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitution of alkoxy-substituted triazine derivatives by alcohol nucleophiles. The new reversible synthetic route enabled the synthesis of previously inaccessible alkyl-polycyanurate thermosets, which exhibit excellent film properties with high chemical resistance, closed-loop recyclability and reprocessing capability. These results show that ‘apparently dormant’ dynamic linkages can be activated and utilized to construct fully recyclable thermoset polymers with a broader monomer scope and increased sustainability. Alkyl and aryl polycyanurate networks have now been prepared through polymerization of diols and substituted triazines via a dynamic SNAr reaction. When treated with excess mono alcohol or phenol, the polycyanurate networks can be depolymerized into the starting monomers, which can be separated and reused, thus achieving closed-loop recycling.

The photochemical ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene imaged by ultrafast electron diffraction

The ultrafast photoinduced ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene constitutes a textbook example of electrocyclic reactions in organic chemistry and a model for photobiological reactions in vitamin D synthesis. Although the relaxation from the photoexcited electronic state during the ring-opening has been investigated in numerous studies, the accompanying changes in atomic distance have not been resolved. Here we present a direct and unambiguous observation of the ring-opening reaction path on the femtosecond timescale and subångström length scale using megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction. We followed the carbon–carbon bond dissociation and the structural opening of the 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring by the direct measurement of time-dependent changes in the distribution of interatomic distances. We observed a substantial acceleration of the ring-opening motion after internal conversion to the ground state due to a steepening of the electronic potential gradient towards the product minima. The ring-opening motion transforms into rotation of the terminal ethylene groups in the photoproduct 1,3,5-hexatriene on the subpicosecond timescale. The photochemical electrocyclic ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a textbook organic chemistry reaction. Now, using ultrafast electron diffraction its reaction pathway has been resolved on the level of atomic distances and on its natural femtosecond timescale. Furthermore, coherent isomerization dynamics of the photoproduct 1,3,5-hexatriene were observed.

Title: 
Cyclic polyacetylene

Here we demonstrate the synthesis of cyclic polyacetylene (c-PA), or [∞]annulene, via homogeneous tungsten-catalysed polymerization of acetylene. Unique to the cyclic structure and evidence for its topology, the c-PA contains &gt;99% trans double bonds, even when synthesized at −94 °C. High activity with low catalyst loadings allows for the synthesis of temporarily soluble c-PA, thus opening the opportunity to derivatize the polymer in solution. Absolute evidence for the cyclic topology comes from atomic force microscopy images of bottlebrush derivatives generated from soluble c-PA. Now available in its cyclic form, initial characterization studies are presented to elucidate the topological differences compared with traditionally synthesized linear polyacetylene. One advantage to the synthesis of c-PA is the direct synthesis of the trans–transoid isomer. Low defect concentrations, low soliton concentration, and relatively high conjugation lengths are characteristics of c-PA. Efficient catalysis permits the rapid synthesis of lustrous flexible thin films of c-PA, and when doped with I2, they are highly conductive (398 (±76) Ω−1 cm−1). Lustrous flexible thin films of semiconducting cyclic polyacetylene (c-PA) have been synthesized and characterized. Rapid and efficient tungsten-catalysed acetylene polymerization conditions produce temporarily soluble c-PA, enabling the in situ derivatization of this typically insoluble polymer. Compelling evidence for the cyclic topology—and its influence on the physical properties of the polymer—are presented.

Competition between chiral solvents and chiral monomers in the helical bias of supramolecular polymers

Solute–solvent interactions are key for the assembly and proper functioning of biomacromolecules and play important roles in many fields of organic and polymer chemistry. Despite numerous reports describing the effects of (chiral) solvents on helical conformations of (supramolecular) polymers, the combination of chiral solvents and chiral monomers is unexplored. Here we report diastereomeric differences in the supramolecular polymerization of enantiomers of chiral triphenylene-2,6,10-tricarboxamides in chiral chlorinated solvents. Competition between the preferences induced by the stereocentres of the assembled monomers and those present in the solvent molecules results in unforeseen temperature-dependent solvation effects. By combining experiments and mathematical modelling, we show that the observed differences between enantiomers originate from the combined additive entropic effects of stereocentres present in the monomer and in the solvent. Remarkably, copolymerizations show that the chiral solvent can bias the copolymer helicity and thereby overrule the helical preference of the monomers. Our results highlight the importance of cumulative solvation effects in supramolecular polymerizations. Mirror-symmetry breaking in chiral systems by a chiral solvent has remained poorly understood for decades. Now, the supramolecular polymerization of triphenylene derivatives has shown that—through the additive effects of polymerization—the cumulative entropic effects of the interactions between chiral solvents and solutes create measurable differences in free enthalpy.

Prevention of dendrite growth and volume expansion to give high-performance aprotic bimetallic Li-Na alloy–O2 batteries

Rechargeable aprotic alkali metal (Li or Na)–O2 batteries are the subject of great interest because of their high theoretical specific energy. However, the growth of dendrites and cracks at the Li or Na anode, as well as their corrosive oxidation lead to poor cycling stability and safety issues. Understanding the mechanism and improving Li/Na-ion plating and stripping electrochemistry are therefore essential to realizing their technological potential. Here, we report how the use of a Li-Na alloy anode and an electrolyte additive realizes an aprotic bimetal Li-Na alloy–O2 battery with improved cycling stability. Electrochemical investigations show that stripping and plating of Li and Na and the robust and flexible passivation film formed in situ (by 1,3-dioxolane additive reacting with the Li-Na alloy) suppress dendrite and buffer alloy anode volume expansion and thus prevent cracking, avoiding electrolyte consumption and ensuring high electron transport efficiency and continued electrochemical reactions. The use of Li or Na as electrodes in Li-Na alloy–O2 batteries creates formidable challenges for both safety and stability because of their oxidative corrosion and the growth of dendrites and cracks on their surface. Now, an aprotic bimetal Li-Na alloy–O2 battery with high cycling stability has been developed using a Li-Na eutectic alloy anode and an electrolyte additive.

Superatomic solid solutions

In atomic solids, substitutional doping of atoms into the lattice of a material to form solid solutions is one of the most powerful approaches to modulating its properties and has led to the discovery of various metal alloys and semiconductors. Herein we have prepared solid solutions in hierarchical solids that are built from atomically precise clusters. Two geometrically similar metal chalcogenide clusters, Co6Se8(PEt3)6 and Cr6Te8(PEt3)6, were combined as random substitutional mixture, in three different ratios, in a crystal lattice together with fullerenes. This does not alter the underlying crystalline structure of the [cluster][C60]2 material, but it influences its electronic and magnetic properties. All three solid solutions showed increased electrical conductivities compared with either the Co- or Cr-based parent material, substantially so for two of the Co:Cr ratios (up to 100-fold), and lowered activation barriers for electron transport. We attribute this to the existence of additional energy states arising from the materials’ structural heterogeneity, which effectively narrow transport gaps. In atomic solids, substitutional doping is a powerful approach to modulating materials properties. Now, three substitutional mixtures of {Co6Se8} and {Cr6Te8} clusters in a crystal lattice with C60 fullerenes have been prepared. At two Co:Cr mixing ratios, the solid solutions showed particularly high electrical conductivities and low activation barriers for electron transport, owing to their structural heterogeneity.

Mesopolymer synthesis by ligand-modulated direct arylation polycondensation towards n-type and ambipolar conjugated systems

Conjugated polymers are attractive components for plastic electronics, but their structural defects, low solubility and batch-to-batch variation—mainly in terms of molecular weight and dispersity—hinder practical applications. Here, we demonstrate that these issues can be circumvented by using conjugated mesopolymers, which have the advantages of both oligomers and polymers. A diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer and a benzothiadiazole derivative react through direct arylation polycondensation, promoted by sterically hindered adamantyl ligand coordinated palladium catalysts, to form mesopolymers. The reaction is facile, environmentally benign (it does not require tin or boron reagents) and occurs in high yields. The resulting mesopolymers have a strictly alternating donor–acceptor structure, without detectable homocoupling and β-arylation defects, and exhibit number-averaged molecular weights (Mn) between 1 and 10 kDa. They also show good solution processability and have significantly enhanced electron mobilities, which makes them n-type and ambipolar semiconductors, with advantages over their polymer counterparts. Conjugated mesopolymers can combine the advantages of polymers and oligomers, but have received less attention as semiconducting materials. Now, such compounds have been synthesized by direct arylation polycondensation that exhibit high molecular regularity, solubility and solution processability. These mesopolymers also show electron mobilities that are significantly better than those of their polymer counterparts.

Planar three-coordinate iron sulfide in a synthetic [4Fe-3S] cluster with biomimetic reactivity

Iron–sulfur clusters are emerging as reactive sites for the reduction of small-molecule substrates. However, the four-coordinate iron sites of typical iron–sulfur clusters rarely react with substrates, implicating three-coordinate iron. This idea is untested because fully sulfide-coordinated three-coordinate iron is unprecedented. Here we report a new type of [4Fe-3S] cluster that features an iron centre with three bonds to sulfides, and characterize examples of the cluster in three oxidation levels using crystallography, spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations. Although a high-spin electronic configuration is characteristic of other iron–sulfur clusters, the three-coordinate iron centre in these clusters has a surprising low-spin electronic configuration due to the planar geometry and short Fe-S bonds. In a demonstration of biomimetic reactivity, the [4Fe-3S] cluster reduces hydrazine, a natural substrate of nitrogenase. The product is the first example of NH2 bound to an iron–sulfur cluster. Our results demonstrate that three-coordinate iron supported by sulfide donors is a plausible precursor to reactivity in iron–sulfur clusters like the FeMoco of nitrogenase. The four-coordinate iron sites of typical iron–sulfur clusters rarely react with small molecules, implicating three-coordinate iron in many catalytic cycles. Now, a [4Fe-3S] cluster featuring three-coordinate iron sulfide that resembles the proposed substrate binding site has been synthesized. This cluster shows biomimetic reactivity with a low-spin electronic configuration.

Complexes featuring a linear [N≡U≡N] core isoelectronic to the uranyl cation

The aqueous chemistry of uranium is dominated by the linear uranyl cation [UO2]2+, yet the isoelectronic nitrogen-based analogue of this ubiquitous cation, molecular [UN2], has so far only been observed in an argon matrix. Here, we present three different complexes of [UN2] obtained by the reaction of the uranium pentahalides UCl5 or UBr5 with anhydrous liquid ammonia. The [UN2] moieties are linear, with the U atoms coordinated by five additional ligands (ammonia, chloride or bromide), resulting in a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination sphere that is also commonly adopted by the uranyl cation [UO2(L)5]2+ (L, ligand). In all three cases, the nitrido ligands are further coordinated through their lone pairs by the Lewis-acidic ligands [U(NH3)8]4+ to form almost linear, trinuclear complex cations. Those were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopy, 14N/15N isotope studies and quantum chemical calculations, which support the presence of two U≡N triple bonds within the [UN2] moieties. Three crystalline complexes comprising a linear [UN2] moiety that is isoelectronic to the ubiquitous uranyl cation [UO2]2+ have been prepared by reaction of UCl5 or UBr5 with liquid ammonia. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the bonding in the [UN2] moieties is best described with two U≡N triple bonds.

Carbohydrate stabilization extends the kinetic limits of chemical polysaccharide depolymerization

Polysaccharide depolymerization is an essential step for valorizing lignocellulosic biomass. In inexpensive systems such as pure water or dilute acid mixtures, carbohydrate monomer degradation rates exceed hemicellulose—and especially cellulose—depolymerization rates at most easily accessible temperatures, limiting sugar yields. Here, we use a reversible stabilization of xylose and glucose by acetal formation with formaldehyde to alter this kinetic paradigm, preventing sugar dehydration to furans and their subsequent degradation. During a harsh organosolv pretreatment in the presence of formaldehyde, over 90% of xylan in beech wood was recovered as diformylxylose (compared to 16% xylose recovery without formaldehyde). The subsequent depolymerization of cellulose led to carbohydrate yields over 70% and a final concentration of ~5 wt%, whereas the same conditions without formaldehyde gave a yield of 28%. This stabilization strategy pushes back the longstanding kinetic limits of polysaccharide depolymerization and enables the recovery of biomass-derived carbohydrates in high yields and concentrations. Chemically depolymerizing biomass polysaccharides to simple sugars is often controlled by the balance between depolymerization and degradation kinetics, which has limited the concentration of solutions that can be obtained and overall yields. The reversible stabilization of carbohydrates by acetal formation pushes back these limits and creates stabilized sugars that have advantageous properties for further upgrading.

Coherent wavepackets in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex are robust to excitonic-structure perturbations caused by mutagenesis

Femtosecond pulsed excitation of light-harvesting complexes creates oscillatory features in their response. This phenomenon has inspired a large body of work aimed at uncovering the origin of the coherent beatings and possible implications for function. Here we exploit site-directed mutagenesis to change the excitonic level structure in Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) complexes and compare the coherences using broadband pump–probe spectroscopy. Our experiments detect two oscillation frequencies with dephasing on a picosecond timescale—both at 77 K and at room temperature. By studying these coherences with selective excitation pump–probe experiments, where pump excitation is in resonance only with the lowest excitonic state, we show that the key contributions to these oscillations stem from ground-state vibrational wavepackets. These experiments explicitly show that the coherences—although in the ground electronic state—can be probed at the absorption resonances of other bacteriochlorophyll molecules because of delocalization of the electronic excitation over several chromophores. Spectroscopists and theorists are closing in on an understanding of the origin of oscillatory features in the spectral response of light-harvesting complexes to femtosecond pulsed excitation. Now, the photosynthetic Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex is probed by femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy and compared with a series of genetically modified mutants with distinct excitonic interactions, allowing electronic and vibrational contributions to coherence to be distinguished.

Impact of non-equilibrium molecular packings on singlet fission in microcrystals observed using 2D white-light microscopy

Singlet fission, the process of splitting a singlet exciton into two triplet excitons, has been proposed as a mechanism for improving the efficiency of future photovoltaic devices. In organic semiconductors exhibiting singlet fission, the geometric relationship between molecules plays an important role by setting the intermolecular couplings that determine the system energetics. Here, we spatially image TIPS-pentacene microcrystals using ultrafast two-dimensional white-light microscopy and discover a low-energy singlet state sparsely distributed throughout the microcrystals, with higher concentrations at edges and morphological defects. The spectra of these singlet states are consistent with slip-stacked molecular geometries and increased charge-transfer couplings. The picosecond-timescale kinetics of these low-energy singlet states matches that of the correlated triplet-pair state, which we attribute to singlet/triplet-pair interconversion at these sites. Our observations support the conclusion that small populations of geometries with favourable energetics can play outsized roles in singlet fission processes. Intermolecular coupling plays a critical role in singlet fission. Now, high-resolution 2D white-light spectroscopy has been used to map the presence of non-equilibrium molecular packing in single TIPS-pentacene microcrystals and characterize its effect on the dynamics of singlet fission.

Ultrafast energy transfer between π-stacked aromatic rings upon inner-valence ionization

Non-covalently bound aromatic systems are ubiquitous and govern the physicochemical properties of various organic materials. They are important to many phenomena of biological and technological relevance, such as protein folding, base-pair stacking in nucleic acids, molecular recognition and self-assembly, DNA–drug interactions, crystal engineering and organic electronics. Nevertheless, their molecular dynamics and chemical reactivity, particularly in electronic excited states, are not fully understood. Here, we observe intermolecular Coulombic decay in benzene dimers, (C6H6)2—the simplest prototypes of noncovalent π–π interactions between aromatic systems. Intermolecular Coulombic decay is initiated by a carbon 2s vacancy state produced by electron-impact ionization and proceeds through ultrafast energy transfer between the benzene molecules. As a result, the dimer relaxes with the emission of a further low-energy electron (&lt;10 eV) and a pair of C6H6+ cations undergoing Coulomb explosion. Coincident fragment-ion and electron momentum spectroscopy, accompanied by ab initio calculations, enables us to elucidate the dynamical details of this ultrafast relaxation process. Aromatic systems that interact non-covalently are important in many settings, such as base-pair stacking and DNA–drug interactions; however, their excited-state molecular dynamics are not fully understood. Now, intermolecular Coulombic decay in benzene dimers has been observed. The process is initiated by electron-impact ionization and proceeds through ultrafast energy transfer between the benzene molecules.

High-throughput phase elucidation of polycrystalline materials using serial rotation electron diffraction

Rapid phase elucidation of polycrystalline materials is essential for developing new materials of chemical, pharmaceutical and industrial interest. Yet, the size and quantity of many crystalline phases are too small for routine X-ray diffraction analysis. This has become a workflow bottleneck in materials development, especially in high-throughput synthesis screening. Here we demonstrate the application of serial rotation electron diffraction (SerialRED) for high-throughput phase identification of complex polycrystalline zeolite products. The products were prepared from a combination of multiple framework T atoms ([Si,Ge,Al] or [Si,Ge,B]) and a simple organic structure-directing agent. We show that using SerialRED, five zeolite phases can be identified from a highly complex mixture. This includes phases with ultra-low contents undetectable using X-ray diffraction and phases with identical crystal morphology and similar unit cell parameters. By automatically and rapidly examining hundreds of crystals, SerialRED enables high-throughput phase analysis and allows the exploration of complex synthesis systems. It provides new opportunities for rapid development of polycrystalline materials. X-ray diffraction is crucial for the phase elucidation of polycrystalline materials but remains challenging for complex multiphase systems. Now serial rotation electron diffraction has been shown to enable rapid, reliable and semiquantitative phase analysis of such systems, facilitating high-throughput screening of complex synthesis systems and providing new opportunities for materials development.

Enantioselective radical C–H amination for the synthesis of β-amino alcohols

Asymmetric, radical C–H functionalizations are rare but powerful tools for solving modern synthetic challenges. Specifically, the enantio- and regioselective C–H amination of alcohols to access medicinally valuable chiral β-amino alcohols remains elusive. To solve this challenge, a radical relay chaperone strategy was designed, wherein an alcohol was transiently converted to an imidate radical that underwent intramolecular H-atom transfer (HAT). This regioselective HAT was also rendered enantioselective by harnessing energy transfer catalysis to mediate selective radical generation and interception by a chiral copper catalyst. The successful development of this multi-catalytic, asymmetric, radical C–H amination enabled broad access to chiral β-amino alcohols from a variety of alcohols containing alkyl, allyl, benzyl and propargyl C–H bonds. Mechanistic experiments revealed that triplet energy sensitization of a Cu-bound radical precursor facilitates catalyst-mediated HAT stereoselectivity, enabling the synthesis of several important classes of chiral β-amines by enantioselective, radical C–H amination. The synthesis of chiral amino alcohols from simple alcohol starting materials can be achieved through a catalytic, asymmetric radical relay. Multiple catalysts work in concert to harness a H-atom transfer mechanism to enable enantio- and regioselective C–H amination by transient N-centred radicals.

Cooperative communication within and between single nanocatalysts

Enzymes often show catalytic allostery in which reactions occurring at different sites communicate cooperatively over distances of up to a few nanometres. Whether such effects can occur with non-biological nanocatalysts remains unclear, even though these nanocatalysts can undergo restructuring and molecules can diffuse over catalyst surfaces. Here we report that phenomenologically similar, but mechanistically distinct, cooperative effects indeed exist for nanocatalysts. Using spatiotemporally resolved single-molecule catalysis imaging, we find that catalytic reactions on a single Pd or Au nanocatalyst can communicate with each other, probably via hopping of positively charged holes on the catalyst surface, over ~102 nanometres and with a temporal memory of ~101 to 102 seconds, giving rise to positive cooperativity among its surface active sites. Similar communication is also observed between individual nanocatalysts, however it operates via a molecular diffusion mechanism involving negatively charged product molecules, and its communication distance is many micrometres. Generalization of these long-range intra- and interparticle catalytic communication mechanisms may introduce a novel conceptual framework for understanding nanoscale catalysis. Nanocatalysts can undergo various dynamic phenomena that affect their activity, such as restructuring and spillover. Now, using spatially and temporally resolved imaging of individual catalytic reactions, cooperative communication between different sites within single palladium-&nbsp;and gold-based nanocatalysts, and between different nanocatalysts, has been observed during three distinct catalytic reactions.

Stimulus-responsive self-assembly of protein-based fractals by computational design

Fractal topologies, which are statistically self-similar over multiple length scales, are pervasive in nature. The recurrence of patterns in fractal-shaped branched objects, such as trees, lungs and sponges, results in a high surface area to volume ratio, which provides key functional advantages including molecular trapping and exchange. Mimicking these topologies in designed protein-based assemblies could provide access to functional biomaterials. Here we describe a computational design approach for the reversible self-assembly of proteins into tunable supramolecular fractal-like topologies in response to phosphorylation. Guided by atomic-resolution models, we develop fusions of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain or a phosphorylatable SH2-binding peptide, respectively, to two symmetric, homo-oligomeric proteins. Mixing the two designed components resulted in a variety of dendritic, hyperbranched and sponge-like topologies that are phosphorylation-dependent and self-similar over three decades (~10 nm–10 μm) of length scale, in agreement with models from multiscale computational simulations. Designed assemblies perform efficient phosphorylation-dependent capture and release of cargo proteins. Fractal topologies are ubiquitous, and synthetic fractal objects provide unique functional advantages by virtue of their high surface area:volume ratios. Now, a computationally guided bottom-up design approach for constructing protein-based fractal assemblies in response to phosphorylation has been developed. Designed assemblies are shown to perform reversible and efficient molecular capture.

Isolation of a californium(II) crown–ether complex

The actinides, from californium to nobelium (Z = 98–102), are known to have an accessible +2 oxidation state. Understanding the origin of this chemical behaviour requires characterizing CfII materials, but investigations are hampered by the fact that they have remained difficult to isolate. This partly arises from the intrinsic challenges of manipulating this unstable element, as well as a lack of suitable reductants that do not reduce CfIII to Cf°. Here we show that a CfII crown–ether complex, Cf(18-crown-6)I2, can be prepared using an Al/Hg amalgam as a reductant. Spectroscopic evidence shows that CfIII can be quantitatively reduced to CfII, and rapid radiolytic re-oxidation in solution yields co-crystallized mixtures of CfII and CfIII complexes without the Al/Hg amalgam. Quantum-chemical calculations show that the Cf‒ligand interactions are highly ionic and that 5f/6d mixing is absent, resulting in weak 5f→5f transitions and an absorption spectrum dominated by 5f→6d transitions. Californium is difficult to prepare in its divalent state. Now, crystals of a Cf(II) crown–ether complex have been synthesized by reduction of a Cf(III) precursor with an Al/Hg amalgam. They exhibit 5f→6d transitions in the visible region and near-infrared emission that are highly sensitive to changes in the coordination environment.

Spontaneous N2 formation by a diruthenium complex enables electrocatalytic and aerobic oxidation of ammonia

The electrochemical conversion of ammonia to dinitrogen in a direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC) is a necessary technology for the realization of a nitrogen economy. Previous efforts to catalyse this reaction with molecular complexes required the addition of exogenous oxidizing reagents or application of potentials greater than the thermodynamic potential for the oxygen reduction reaction—the cathodic process of a DAFC. We report a stable metal–metal bonded diruthenium complex that spontaneously produces dinitrogen from ammonia under ambient conditions. The resulting reduced diruthenium material can be reoxidized with oxygen for subsequent reactions with ammonia, demonstrating its ability to spontaneously promote both half-reactions necessary for a DAFC. The diruthenium complex also acts as a redox mediator for the electrocatalytic oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen at potentials as low as −255 mV versus Fc0/+ and operates below the oxygen reduction reaction potential in alkaline conditions, thus achieving a thermodynamic viability relevant for the future development of DAFCs. The use of ammonia as an alternative fuel relies on its electrochemical conversion to dinitrogen in a fuel cell. Now a stable metal–metal bonded diruthenium complex is shown to spontaneously produce dinitrogen from ammonia under ambient conditions and is also able to electrocatalyse the oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen at low potentials.

Title: 
Charge-density reduction promotes ribozyme activity in RNA–peptide coacervates via RNA fluidization and magnesium partitioning

It has long been proposed that phase-separated compartments can provide a basis for the formation of cellular precursors in prebiotic environments. However, we know very little about the properties of coacervates formed from simple peptides, their compatibility with ribozymes or their functional significance. Here we assess the conditions under which functional ribozymes form coacervates with simple peptides. We find coacervation to be most robust when transitioning from long homopeptides to shorter, more pre-biologically plausible heteropeptides. We mechanistically show that these RNA–peptide coacervates display peptide-dependent material properties and cofactor concentrations. We find that the interspacing of cationic and neutral amino acids increases RNA mobility, and we use isothermal calorimetry to reveal sequence-dependent Mg2+ partitioning, two critical factors that together enable ribozyme activity. Our results establish how peptides of limited length, homogeneity and charge density facilitate the compartmentalization of active ribozymes into non-gelating, magnesium-rich coacervates, a scenario that could be applicable to cellular precursors with peptide-dependent functional phenotypes. Phase-separated compartments have long been proposed as precursors to cellular life. Now, it has been shown that RNA–peptide protocells are more robust when formed using shorter (rather than longer) peptides, and that peptide sequence determines the functional materials properties of these compartments.

Title: 
O-GlcNAc modification of small heat shock proteins enhances their anti-amyloid chaperone activity

A major role for the intracellular post-translational modification O-GlcNAc appears to be the inhibition of protein aggregation. Most of the previous studies in this area focused on O-GlcNAc modification of the amyloid-forming proteins themselves. Here we used synthetic protein chemistry to discover that O-GlcNAc also activates the anti-amyloid activity of certain small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), a potentially more important modification event that can act broadly and substoichiometrically. More specifically, we found that O-GlcNAc increases the ability of sHSPs to block the amyloid formation of both α-synuclein and Aβ(1–42). Mechanistically, we show that O-GlcNAc near the sHSP IXI-domain prevents its ability to intramolecularly compete with substrate binding. Finally, we found that, although O-GlcNAc levels are globally reduced in Alzheimer’s disease brains, the modification of relevant sHSPs is either maintained or increased, which suggests a mechanism to maintain these potentially protective O-GlcNAc modifications. Our results have important implications for neurodegenerative diseases associated with amyloid formation and potentially other areas of sHSP biology. The post-translational modification O-GlcNAc on amyloid-forming proteins can inhibit their aggregation. Now, it has been shown that O-GlcNAc modification of small heat shock proteins HSP27, αA- and αB-crystallin can increase their anti-amyloid activity and block the amyloid formation of both α-synuclein and Aβ(1–42). A mechanism for this protective effect based on decreased physical interactions is also proposed.

Olefin metathesis-based chemically recyclable polymers enabled by fused-ring monomers

A promising solution to address the challenges in plastics sustainability is to replace current polymers with chemically recyclable ones that can depolymerize into their constituent monomers to enable the circular use of materials. Despite some progress, few depolymerizable polymers exhibit the desirable thermal stability and strong mechanical properties of traditional polymers. Here we report a series of chemically recyclable polymers that show excellent thermal stability (decomposition temperature &gt;370 °C) and tunable mechanical properties. The polymers are formed through ring-opening metathesis polymerization of cyclooctene with a trans-cyclobutane installed at the 5 and 6 positions. The additional ring converts the non-depolymerizable polycyclooctene into a depolymerizable polymer by reducing the ring strain energy in the monomer (from 8.2 kcal mol–1 in unsubstituted cyclooctene to 4.9 kcal mol–1 in the fused ring). The fused-ring monomer enables a broad scope of functionalities to be incorporated, providing access to chemically recyclable elastomers and plastics that show promise as next-generation sustainable materials. Depolymerizable polymers can potentially address challenges in polymer sustainability, but most existing systems lack the useful thermomechanical properties of traditional ones. Now, it has been shown that depolymerizable polymers based on olefin metathesis show good thermal stability as well as versatile mechanical properties and that the monomers used to make them can be prepared from abundant materials.

Facile synthesis of precious-metal single-site catalysts using organic solvents

Single-site catalysts can demonstrate high activity and selectivity in many catalytic reactions. The synthesis of these materials by impregnation from strongly oxidizing aqueous solutions or pH-controlled deposition often leads to low metal loadings or a range of metal species. Here, we demonstrate that simple impregnation of the metal precursors onto activated carbon from a low-boiling-point, low-polarity solvent, such as acetone, results in catalysts with an atomic dispersion of cationic metal species. We show the generality of this method by producing single-site Au, Pd, Ru and Pt catalysts supported on carbon in a facile manner. Single-site Au/C catalysts have previously been validated commercially to produce vinyl chloride, and here we show that this facile synthesis method can produce effective catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination in the absence of the highly oxidizing acidic solvents previously used. Au/C single-site catalysts have been validated commercially for acetylene hydrochlorination, but they have previously been prepared using highly oxidizing acidic solvents or additional ligands. It has now been shown that they can be made by impregnation of a metal salt from an acetone solution—generating catalysts with comparable activity to those synthesized by the other methods.

Prebiotic synthesis and triphosphorylation of 3′-amino-TNA nucleosides

Nucleosides are essential to the emergence of life, and so their synthesis is a key challenge for prebiotic chemistry. Although amino-nucleosides have enhanced reactivity in water compared with ribonucleosides, they are assumed to be prebiotically irrelevant due to perceived difficulties with their selective formation. Here we demonstrate that 3′-amino-TNA nucleosides (TNA, threose nucleic acid) are formed diastereoselectively and regiospecifically from prebiotic feedstocks in four high-yielding steps. Phosphate provides an unexpected resolution, leading to spontaneous purification of the genetically relevant threo-isomer. Furthermore, 3′-amino-TNA nucleosides are shown to be phosphorylated directly in water, under mild conditions with cyclic trimetaphosphate, forming a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) in a manner not feasible for canonical nucleosides. Our results suggest 3′-amino-TNA nucleosides may have been present on the early Earth, and the ease with which these NTPs form, alongside the inherent selectivity for the Watson–Crick base-pairing threo-monomer, warrants further study of the role they could play during the emergence of life. Nucleotides are essential to the origins of life, and their synthesis is a key challenge for prebiotic chemistry. Contrary to prior expectation, non-canonical 3′-amino-TNA nucleosides are shown to be synthesized diastereoselectively and regiospecifically under prebiotically plausible conditions. The enhanced reactivity of 3′-amino-TNAs also promotes their selective non-enzymatic triphosphorylation in water.

Direct observation of sequential oxidations of a titania-bound molecular proxy catalyst generated through illumination of molecular sensitizers

Natural photosynthesis uses the energy in sunlight to oxidize or reduce reaction centres multiple times, therefore preparing each reaction centre for a multiple-electron-transfer reaction that will ultimately generate stable reaction products. This process relies on multiple chromophores per reaction centre to quickly generate the active state of the reaction centre and to outcompete deleterious charge recombination. Using a similar design principle, we report spectroscopic evidence for the generation of a twice-oxidized TiO2-bound molecular proxy catalyst after low-intensity visible-light excitation of co-anchored molecular Ru(II)–polypyridyl dyes. Electron transfer from an excited dye to TiO2 generated a Ru(III) state that subsequently and repeatedly reacted with neighbouring Ru(II) dyes via self-exchange electron transfer to ultimately oxidize a distant co-anchored proxy catalyst before charge recombination. The largest yield for twice-oxidized proxy catalysts occurred when they were present at low coverage, suggesting that large dye/electrocatalyst ratios are also desired in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells. Photosynthesis uses sunlight to oxidize or reduce reaction centres multiple times and prepare them for multiple-electron-transfer reactions. Now, it has been shown that a molecular proxy for a multiple-electron-transfer electrocatalyst can be oxidized twice by dye molecules when both are anchored to a mesoporous TiO2 thin film and excited with low-intensity visible light.

An autonomously oscillating supramolecular self-replicator

A key goal of chemistry is to develop synthetic systems that mimic biology, such as self-assembling, self-replicating models of minimal life forms. Oscillations are often observed in complex biological networks, but oscillating, self-replicating species are unknown, and how to control autonomous supramolecular-level oscillating systems is also not yet established. Here we show how a population of self-assembling self-replicators can autonomously oscillate, so that simple micellar species repeatedly appear and disappear in time. The interplay of molecular and supramolecular events is key to observing oscillations: the repeated formation and disappearance of compartments is connected to a reaction network where molecular-level species are formed and broken down. The dynamic behaviour of our system across different length scales offers the opportunities for mass transport, as we demonstrate via reversible dye uptake. We believe these findings will inspire new biomimetic systems and may unlock nanotechnology systems such as (supra)molecular pumps, where compartment formation is controlled in time and space. Oscillations are widespread throughout the natural world and a number of fascinating inorganic oscillating reactions are known—but the formation and control of oscillating, self-replicating synthetic systems has remained challenging. Now, it has been shown that chemically fuelled oscillations within a network of organic replicators can drive supramolecular assembly and disassembly.

How synonymous mutations alter enzyme structure and function over long timescales

The specific activity of enzymes can be altered over long timescales in cells by synonymous mutations that alter a messenger RNA molecule’s sequence but not the encoded protein’s primary structure. How this happens at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we use multiscale modelling of three Escherichia coli enzymes (type III chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, d-alanine–d-alanine ligase B and dihydrofolate reductase) to understand experimentally measured changes in specific activity due to synonymous mutations. The modelling involves coarse-grained simulations of protein synthesis and post-translational behaviour, all-atom simulations to test robustness and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations to characterize enzymatic function. We show that changes in codon translation rates induced by synonymous mutations cause shifts in co-translational and post-translational folding pathways that kinetically partition molecules into subpopulations that very slowly interconvert to the native, functional state. Structurally, these states resemble the native state, with localized misfolding near the active sites of the enzymes. These long-lived states exhibit reduced catalytic activity, as shown by their increased activation energies for the reactions they catalyse. Enzymes with identical sequences of amino acids can display varying activities when encoded with mRNA with different properties, but why this is the case has been a mystery. Now, it has been shown that synonymous mutations in mRNA alter the partitioning of proteins into long-lived soluble misfolded states with varying activities.

An intramolecular coupling approach to alkyl bioisosteres for the synthesis of multisubstituted bicycloalkyl boronates

Bicyclic hydrocarbons, and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) in particular, are playing an emerging role as saturated bioisosteres in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and materials chemistry. Taking advantage of strain-release strategies, prior synthetic studies have featured the synthesis of bridgehead-substituted (C1, C3) BCPs from [1.1.1]propellane. Here, we describe an approach to access multisubstituted BCPs via intramolecular cyclization. In addition to C1,C3-disubstituted BCPs, this method also enables the construction of underexplored multisubstituted (C1, C2 and C3) BCPs from readily accessible cyclobutanones. The broad generality of this method has also been examined through the synthesis of a variety of other caged bicyclic molecules, ranging from [2.1.1] to [3.2.1] scaffolds. The modularity afforded by the pendant bridgehead boron pinacol esters generated during the cyclization reaction has been demonstrated through several downstream functionalizations, highlighting the ability of this approach to enable the programmed and divergent synthesis of multisubstituted bicyclic hydrocarbons. Bicyclic hydrocarbons, and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes in particular, are playing an emerging role as saturated bioisosteres in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and materials intramolecular coupling approach has been developed for the modular construction of underexplored multisubstituted strained bicyclic hydrocarbons, ranging from [1.1.1] to [3.2.1] scaffolds.

On-surface photopolymerization of two-dimensional polymers ordered on the mesoscale

The use of solid supports and ultra-high vacuum conditions for the synthesis of two-dimensional polymers is attractive, as it can enable thorough characterization, often with submolecular resolution, and prevent contamination. However, most on-surface polymerizations are thermally activated, which often leads to high defect densities and relatively small domain sizes. Here, we have obtained a porous two-dimensional polymer that is ordered on the mesoscale by the two-staged topochemical photopolymerization of fluorinated anthracene triptycene (fantrip) monomers on alkane-passivated graphite surfaces under ultra-high vacuum. First, the fantrip monomers self-assemble into highly ordered monolayer structures, where all anthracene moieties adopt a suitable arrangement for photopolymerization. Irradiation with violet light then induces complete covalent crosslinking by [4+4] photocycloaddition to form a two-dimensional polymer, while fully preserving the long-range order of the self-assembled structure. The extent of the polymerization is confirmed by local infrared spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy characterization, in agreement with density functional theory calculations, which also gives mechanistic insights. On-surface, ultra-high vacuum conditions enable two-dimensional polymerizations to be precisely studied—often with submolecular resolution—but these syntheses are typically thermally activated, which can lead to high defect densities and relatively small domain sizes. Now, a self-assembled monolayer of a three-bladed fantrip monomer on alkane-passivated graphite has been covalently crosslinked into a mesoscale-ordered two-dimensional polymer by [4+4] photocycloaddition.

Post-translational backbone-acyl shift yields natural product-like peptides bearing hydroxyhydrocarbon units

Hydroxyhydrocarbon (Hhc) moieties in the backbone of peptidic natural products can exert a substantial influence on the bioactivities of the products, making Hhc units an attractive class of building blocks for de novo peptides. However, despite advances in in vitro genetic code reprogramming, the ribosomal incorporation of Hhc units remains challenging. Here we report a method for in vitro ribosomal synthesis of natural-product-like peptides bearing Hhc units. A series of azide/hydroxy acids were designed as chemical precursors of Hhc units and incorporated into the nascent peptide chain by means of genetic code reprogramming. Post-translational reduction of the azide induced an O-to-N acyl shift to rearrange the peptide backbone. This method allows for one-pot ribosomal synthesis of designer macrocycles bearing various β-, γ- and δ-type Hhc units. We also report the synthesis of a statine-containing peptidomimetic inhibitor of β-secretase 1 as a showcase example. Despite recent advances in engineering of in vitro translation systems, direct ribosomal incorporation of hydroxyhydrocarbon moieties—which can endow peptides with unique biochemical/folding properties—remains challenging. Now, incorporation of translation-compatible azide/hydroxy acids and their post-translational tandem backbone-acyl shifts have enabled in vitro ribosomal synthesis of peptides containing various hydroxyhydrocarbon units.

Complementary site-selectivity in arene functionalization enabled by overcoming the ortho constraint in palladium/norbornene catalysis

Achieving site-selectivity in arene functionalization that is complementary to the site-selectivity from electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions has been a long-standing quest in organic synthesis. Palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis potentially offers a unique approach to this problem, but its use has been hampered by the ortho constraint, which is the requirement of an ortho substituent for mono ortho functionalization of haloarenes. Here, we show that such a challenge could be addressed using a new class of bridgehead-modified norbornenes, thereby enabling a broadly useful strategy for arene functionalization with complementary site-selectivity. A range of ortho-unsubstituted aryl iodides, previously problematic substrates, can now be employed to provide mono ortho-functionalized products effectively. This method is applicable for late-stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules at positions that are difficult to reach by conventional approaches. Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) favours arene functionalization at positions meta to electron-withdrawing groups and para to electron-donating groups. Now, with a class of bridgehead-modified norbonene derivatives that can overcome the ortho constraint typical in palladium/norbornene catalysis, arene functionalization with site-selectivity complementary to EAS approaches can be achieved.

Engineering the entropy-driven free-energy landscape of a dynamic nanoporous protein assembly

De novo design and construction of stimuli-responsive protein assemblies that predictably switch between discrete conformational states remains an essential but highly challenging goal in biomolecular design. We previously reported synthetic, two-dimensional protein lattices self-assembled via disulfide bonding interactions, which endows them with a unique capacity to undergo coherent conformational changes without losing crystalline order. Here, we carried out all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to map the free-energy landscape of these lattices, validated this landscape through extensive structural characterization by electron microscopy and established that it is predominantly governed by solvent reorganization entropy. Subsequent redesign of the protein surface with conditionally repulsive electrostatic interactions enabled us to predictably perturb the free-energy landscape and obtain a new protein lattice whose conformational dynamics can be chemically and mechanically toggled between three different states with varying porosities and molecular densities. Living systems rely on externally tuneable and stimuli-responsive conformational changes of proteins and protein assemblies for a wide range of essential functions. A combination of experimental and computational analyses has now enabled the fabrication of a rationally designed, synthetic, stimuli-responsive protein assembly through modulation of its free-energy landscape.

Serial crystallography captures dynamic control of sequential electron and proton transfer events in a flavoenzyme

Flavin coenzymes are universally found in biological redox reactions. DNA photolyases, with their flavin chromophore (FAD), utilize blue light for DNA repair and photoreduction. The latter process involves two single-electron transfers to FAD with an intermittent protonation step to prime the enzyme active for DNA repair. Here we use time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography to describe how light-driven electron transfers trigger subsequent nanosecond-to-microsecond entanglement between FAD and its Asn/Arg-Asp redox sensor triad. We found that this key feature within the photolyase-cryptochrome family regulates FAD re-hybridization and protonation. After first electron transfer, the FAD•− isoalloxazine ring twists strongly when the arginine closes in to stabilize the negative charge. Subsequent breakage of the arginine–aspartate salt bridge allows proton transfer from arginine to FAD•−. Our molecular videos demonstrate how the protein environment of redox cofactors organizes multiple electron/proton transfer events in an ordered fashion, which could be applicable to other redox systems such as photosynthesis. A reduction reaction is usually equated with an electron transfer reaction. Now, ultrafast time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography has enabled the visualization of the stepwise structural changes that occur after electron transfers have been observed in the light-triggered reduction of flavin adenine dinucleotide catalysed by DNA photolyase.

A closed cycle for esterifying aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2 and alcohol

The ability to functionalize hydrocarbons with CO2 could create opportunities for high-volume CO2 utilization. However, current methods to form carbon–carbon bonds between hydrocarbons and CO2 require stoichiometric consumption of very resource-intensive reagents to overcome the low reactivity of these substrates. Here, we report a simple semi-continuous cycle that converts aromatic hydrocarbons, CO2 and alcohol into aromatic esters without consumption of stoichiometric reagents. Our strategy centres on the use of solid bases composed of an alkali carbonate (M2CO3, where M+ = K+ or Cs+) dispersed over a mesoporous support. Nanoscale confinement disrupts the crystallinity of M2CO3 and engenders strong base reactivity at intermediate temperatures. The overall cycle involves two distinct steps: (1) CO32–-promoted C–H carboxylation, in which the hydrocarbon substrate is deprotonated by the supported M2CO3 and reacts with CO2 to form a supported carboxylate (RCO2M); and (2) methylation, in which RCO2M reacts with methanol and CO2 to form an isolable methyl ester with concomitant regeneration of M2CO3. Previous methods for functionalizing hydrocarbons with CO2 to form carboxylic acid derivatives have required stoichiometric energy-intensive reagents such as strong bases or electrophilic activators. Now, a simple solid base has been developed that transforms aromatic hydrocarbons, CO2 and methanol into aromatic esters via a two-step cycle requiring no additional reagents.

Olanzapine crystal symmetry originates in preformed centrosymmetric solute dimers

The symmetries of a crystal are notoriously uncorrelated to those of its constituent molecules. This symmetry breaking is typically thought to occur during crystallization. Here we demonstrate that one of the two symmetry elements of olanzapine crystals, an inversion centre, emerges in solute dimers extant in solution prior to crystallization. We combine time-resolved in situ scanning probe microscopy to monitor the crystal growth processes with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We show that crystals grow non-classically, predominantly by incorporation of centrosymmetric dimers. The growth rate of crystal layers exhibits a quadratic dependence on the solute concentration, characteristic of the second-order kinetics of the incorporation of dimers, which exist in equilibrium with a majority of monomers. We show that growth by dimers is preferred due to overwhelming accumulation of adsorbed dimers on the crystal surface, where it is complemented by dimerization and expedites dimer incorporation into growth sites. Crystal symmetry is notoriously uncorrelated to the symmetry of the constituent molecules that make up a crystal. Symmetry breaking is typically thought to occur during nucleation and growth, but a symmetry element of olanzapine crystals—an inversion centre—has now been shown to emerge in centrosymmetric dimers extant in solution prior to crystallization.

Efficient photon upconversion enabled by strong coupling between silicon quantum dots and anthracene

Hybrid structures formed between organic molecules and inorganic quantum dots can accomplish unique photophysical transformations by taking advantage of their disparate properties. The electronic coupling between these materials is typically weak, leading photoexcited charge carriers to spatially localize to the dot or to a molecule at its surface. However, we show that by converting a chemical linker that covalently binds anthracene molecules to silicon quantum dots from a carbon–carbon single bond to a double bond, we access a strong coupling regime where excited carriers spatially delocalize across both anthracene and silicon. By pushing the system to delocalize, we design a photon upconversion system with a higher efficiency (17.2%) and lower threshold intensity (0.5 W cm–2) than that of a corresponding weakly coupled system. Our results show that strong coupling between molecules and nanostructures achieved through targeted linking chemistry provides a complementary route for tailoring properties in materials for light-driven applications. Hybrid structures made up of quantum dots functionalized with molecules are highly tunable platforms for light-driven applications; however, the interaction between their components is often weak. Now it has been shown that by connecting molecules to silicon quantum dots via p-conjugated tethers, strongly coupled exciton states can be generated that prove advantageous for photon upconversion.

Circumventing the stability problems of graphene nanoribbon zigzag edges

Carbon nanostructures with zigzag edges exhibit unique properties—such as localized electronic states and spins—with exciting potential applications. Such nanostructures however are generally synthesized under vacuum because their zigzag edges are unstable under ambient conditions: a barrier that must be surmounted to achieve their scalable integration into devices for practical purposes. Here we show two chemical protection/deprotection strategies, demonstrated on labile, air-sensitive chiral graphene nanoribbons. Upon hydrogenation, the chiral graphene nanoribbons survive exposure to air, after which they are easily converted back to their original structure by annealing. We also approach the problem from another angle by synthesizing a form of the chiral graphene nanoribbons that is functionalized with ketone side groups. This oxidized form is chemically stable and can be converted to the pristine hydrocarbon form by hydrogenation and annealing. In both cases, the deprotected chiral graphene nanoribbons regain electronic properties similar to those of the pristine nanoribbons. We believe both approaches may be extended to other graphene nanoribbons and carbon-based nanostructures. On-surface synthesis enables highly reactive structures to be produced under vacuum, but they need to be passivated to be incorporated into practical devices. Here, the facile protection of air-sensitive chiral graphene nanoribbons has been shown, by either hydrogenation or synthesis of an oxidized form. The chemically stable forms can subsequently be deprotected.

Title: 
A catenane that is topologically achiral despite being composed of oriented rings

Catenanes—molecules comprising two interlocking rings held together like links in a chain—are topologically non-trivial: a catenane is a topological isomer of its separated rings, but the rings cannot be disconnected without bond scission. Catenanes can exist as topological enantiomers if both rings have directionality conferred by a defined atom sequence, but this has led to the assumption that the stereochemistry of chiral catenanes composed of oriented rings is inherently topological in nature. Here we show that this assumption is incorrect by synthesizing an example that contains the same fundamental stereogenic unit but whose stereochemistry is Euclidean. One ring in this chiral catenane is oriented by the geometry of an exocyclic double rather than determined by atom sequence within the ring. Isomerization of the exocyclic double bond results in racemization of the catenane, confirming that the stereochemistry is not topological in nature. Thus, we can unite the stereochemistry of catenanes with that of their topologically trivial cousins, the rotaxanes, enabling a more unified approach to their discussion. Catenanes are topologically non-trivial and, perhaps for this reason, molecules composed of two oriented rings have always simply been referred to as ‘topologically chiral’. Now it has been shown that the same stereogenic unit can arise in systems whose stereochemistry is Euclidean, suggesting a need to rethink this fundamental form of mechanical chirality.

Protein folding modulates the chemical reactivity of a Gram-positive adhesin

Gram-positive bacteria colonize mucosal tissues, withstanding large mechanical perturbations such as coughing, which generate shear forces that exceed the ability of non-covalent bonds to remain attached. To overcome these challenges, the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes utilizes the protein Cpa, a pilus tip-end adhesin equipped with a Cys–Gln thioester bond. The reactivity of this bond towards host surface ligands enables covalent anchoring; however, colonization also requires cell migration and spreading over surfaces. The molecular mechanisms underlying these seemingly incompatible requirements remain unknown. Here we demonstrate a magnetic tweezers force spectroscopy assay that resolves the dynamics of the Cpa thioester bond under force. When folded at forces &lt;6 pN, the Cpa thioester bond reacts reversibly with amine ligands, which are common in inflammation sites; however, mechanical unfolding and exposure to forces &gt;6 pN block thioester reformation. We hypothesize that this folding-coupled reactivity switch (termed a smart covalent bond) could allow the adhesin to undergo binding and unbinding to surface ligands under low force and remain covalently attached under mechanical stress. Bacteria use thioester-bond-containing proteins to covalently bind to host surfaces and withstand large mechanical shocks. Now, thioester bond reactivity has been shown to be force-dependent: forces &gt;35 pN inhibit bond cleavage by primary amine ligands, whereas forces &lt;6 pN enable reversible reformation. This force-modulated thioester bond reactivity could potentially enable bacterial mobility and a route by which they optimize infection.

Title: 
The role of bridging ligands in dinitrogen reduction and functionalization by uranium multimetallic complexes

Cooperativity between metal centres is identified as a crucial step in dinitrogen reduction both for the industrial Haber–Bosch process and for the natural fixation of nitrogen by nitrogenase enzymes, but the mechanism of N2 reduction remains poorly understood. This is in large part because multimetallic complexes that reduce and functionalize dinitrogen in the absence of strong alkali reducing agents are crucial to establish a structure–activity relationship, but remain extremely rare. Recently, we reported a multimetallic nitride-bridged diuranium(iii) complex capable of reducing and functionalizing dinitrogen. Here we show that an analogous complex assembled with an oxo instead of a nitride linker also effects the four-electron reduction of dinitrogen, but the reactivity of the resulting oxo–(N2) complex differs significantly from that of the nitride–(N2). Computational studies show a different bonding scheme for the dinitrogen where the bridging nitride does participate in the binding and consequent activation of N2, while the oxide does not. Nitrogen fixation—the direct conversion of dinitrogen into ammonia or other nitrogen-containing products—is notoriously difficult to promote under mild conditions. Now, the reactivity of a multimetallic diuranium(iii) complex recently found capable of reducing and functionalizing N2 has been explored, replacing its nitride bridge with an oxo bridge, which resulted in a markedly different reactivity.

Metathesis-active ligands enable a catalytic functional group metathesis between aroyl chlorides and aryl iodides

Current methods for functional group interconversion have, for the most part, relied on relatively strong driving forces which often require highly reactive reagents to generate irreversibly a desired product in high yield and selectivity. These approaches generally prevent the use of the same catalytic strategy to perform the reverse reaction. Here we describe a catalytic functional group metathesis approach to interconvert, under CO-free conditions, two synthetically important classes of electrophiles that are often employed in the preparation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals—aroyl chlorides (ArCOCl) and aryl iodides (ArI). Our reaction design relies on the implementation of a key reversible ligand C–P bond cleavage event, which enables a non-innocent, metathesis-active phosphine ligand to mediate a rapid aryl group transfer between the two different electrophiles. Beyond enabling a practical and safer approach to the interconversion of ArCOCl and ArI, this type of ligand non-innocence provides a blueprint for the development of a broad range of functional group metathesis reactions employing synthetically relevant aryl electrophiles. Functional group interconversion typically requires reactive reagents to irreversibly generate a desired product in high yield and selectivity. Now, a CO-free catalytic functional-group-metathesis approach can be used to interconvert aroyl chlorides and aryl iodides—two important classes of electrophiles often employed in the preparation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals—with the help of metathesis-active phosphine ligands.

CD44 regulates epigenetic plasticity by mediating iron endocytosis

CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein linked to various biological processes reliant on epigenetic plasticity, which include development, inflammation, immune responses, wound healing and cancer progression. Although it is often referred to as a cell surface marker, the functional regulatory roles of CD44 remain elusive. Here we report the discovery that CD44 mediates the endocytosis of iron-bound hyaluronates in tumorigenic cell lines, primary cancer cells and tumours. This glycan-mediated iron endocytosis mechanism is enhanced during epithelial–mesenchymal transitions, in which iron operates as a metal catalyst to demethylate repressive histone marks that govern the expression of mesenchymal genes. CD44 itself is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear iron through a positive feedback loop, which is in contrast to the negative regulation of the transferrin receptor by excess iron. Finally, we show that epigenetic plasticity can be altered by interfering with iron homeostasis using small molecules. This study reveals an alternative iron-uptake mechanism that prevails in the mesenchymal state of cells, which illuminates a central role of iron as a rate-limiting regulator of epigenetic plasticity. CD44 is a cell-surface adhesion receptor associated with many biological processes that rely on cellular plasticity. Now, CD44 has been shown to mediate endocytosis of iron-bound hyaluronates. Furthermore, iron catalyses the demethylation of repressive histone marks, thereby unlocking the expression of genes regulating cellular plasticity.

Title: 
Nuclear spin conservation enables state-to-state control of ultracold molecular reactions

Quantum-state control of reactive systems has enabled microscopic probes of underlying interaction potentials and the alteration of reaction rates using quantum statistics. However, extending such control to the quantum states of reaction outcomes remains challenging. Here, we realize this goal by utilizing the conservation of nuclear spins throughout the reaction. Using resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization spectroscopy to investigate the products formed in bimolecular reactions between ultracold KRb molecules we find that the system retains a near-perfect memory of the reactants’ nuclear spins, manifested as a strong parity preference for the rotational states of the products. We leverage this effect to alter the occupation of these product states by changing the coherent superposition of initial nuclear spin states with an external magnetic field. In this way, we are able to control both the inputs and outputs of a reaction with quantum-state resolution. The techniques demonstrated here open up the possibilities to study quantum entanglement between reaction products and ultracold reaction dynamics at the state-to-state level. Energy scrambling in intermediate complexes—which form in many chemical reactions—presents a major challenge to state-to-state control. However, nuclear spin tends to remain unchanged throughout reactions and now, by manipulating the reactants’ nuclear spins using an external magnetic field, control over the product state distribution of a bimolecular reaction has been demonstrated.

Title: 
Transferring the entatic-state principle to copper photochemistry

The entatic state denotes a distorted coordination geometry of a complex from its typical arrangement that generates an improvement to its function. The entatic-state principle has been observed to apply to copper electron-transfer proteins and it results in a lowering of the reorganization energy of the electron-transfer process. It is thus crucial for a multitude of biochemical processes, but its importance to photoactive complexes is unexplored. Here we study a copper complex—with a specifically designed constraining ligand geometry—that exhibits metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state lifetimes that are very short. The guanidine–quinoline ligand used here acts on the bis(chelated) copper(I) centre, allowing only small structural changes after photoexcitation that result in very fast structural dynamics. The data were collected using a multimethod approach that featured time-resolved ultraviolet–visible, infrared and X-ray absorption and optical emission spectroscopy. Through supporting density functional calculations, we deliver a detailed picture of the structural dynamics in the picosecond-to-nanosecond time range. According to the entatic-state principle, distortions of the coordination geometry of a reacting compound can optimize the energies of starting and final states to improve reaction rates. Here, the entatic-state principle is observed to apply to photoactive copper complexes that have a constrained ligand geometry, resulting in very short charge-transfer state lifetimes.

Deciphering how naturally occurring sequence features impact the phase behaviours of disordered prion-like domains

Prion-like low-complexity domains (PLCDs) have distinctive sequence grammars that determine their driving forces for phase separation. Here we uncover the physicochemical underpinnings of how evolutionarily conserved compositional biases influence the phase behaviour of PLCDs. We interpret our results in the context of the stickers-and-spacers model for the phase separation of associative polymers. We find that tyrosine is a stronger sticker than phenylalanine, whereas arginine is a context-dependent auxiliary sticker. In contrast, lysine weakens sticker–sticker interactions. Increasing the net charge per residue destabilizes phase separation while also weakening the strong coupling between single-chain contraction in dilute phases and multichain interactions that give rise to phase separation. Finally, glycine and serine residues act as non-equivalent spacers, and thus make the glycine versus serine contents an important determinant of the driving forces for phase separation. The totality of our results leads to a set of rules that enable comparative estimates of composition-specific driving forces for PLCD phase separation. The complex link between protein sequence and phase behaviour for a family of prion-like low-complexity domains (PLCDs) has now been revealed. The results have uncovered a set of rules—which are interpreted using a stickers-and-spacers model—that govern the sequence-encoded phase behaviour of such PLCDs and enable physicochemical rationalizations that are connected to the underlying sequence composition.

Coupling N2 and CO2 in H2O to synthesize urea under ambient conditions

The use of nitrogen fertilizers has been estimated to have supported 27% of the world’s population over the past century. Urea (CO(NH2)2) is conventionally synthesized through two consecutive industrial processes, N2 + H2 → NH3 followed by NH3 + CO2 → urea. Both reactions operate under harsh conditions and consume more than 2% of the world’s energy. Urea synthesis consumes approximately 80% of the NH3 produced globally. Here we directly coupled N2 and CO2 in H2O to produce urea under ambient conditions. The process was carried out using an electrocatalyst consisting of PdCu alloy nanoparticles on TiO2 nanosheets. This coupling reaction occurs through the formation of C–N bonds via the thermodynamically spontaneous reaction between *N=N* and CO. Products were identified and quantified using isotope labelling and the mechanism investigated using isotope-labelled operando synchrotron-radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A high rate of urea formation of 3.36 mmol g–1 h–1 and corresponding Faradic efficiency of 8.92% were measured at –0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Conventionally, urea is synthesized via two consecutive processes, N2 + H2 → NH3 followed by NH3 + CO2. Now, an electrocatalyst consisting of PdCu alloy nanoparticles on TiO2 nanosheets has been shown to directly couple N2 and CO2 in H2O to produce urea under ambient conditions.

Stereoelectronic effects in stabilizing protein–N-glycan interactions revealed by experiment and machine learning

The energetics of protein–carbohydrate interactions, central to many life processes, cannot yet be manipulated predictably. This is mostly due to an incomplete quantitative understanding of the enthalpic and entropic basis of these interactions in aqueous solution. Here, we show that stereoelectronic effects contribute to stabilizing protein–N-glycan interactions in the context of a cooperatively folding protein. Double-mutant cycle analyses of the folding data from 52 electronically varied N-glycoproteins demonstrate an enthalpy–entropy compensation depending on the electronics of the interacting side chains. Linear and nonlinear models obtained using quantum mechanical calculations and machine learning explain up to 79% and 97% of the experimental interaction energy variability, as inferred from the R2 value of the respective models. Notably, the protein–carbohydrate interaction energies strongly correlate with the molecular orbital energy gaps of the interacting substructures. This suggests that stereoelectronic effects must be given a greater weight than previously thought for accurately modelling the short-range dispersive van der Waals interactions between the N-glycan and the protein. Analysis of the thermodynamics of protein–N-glycan interactions perturbed by mutations has revealed an enthalpy–entropy compensation that depends on the electronics of the interacting side chains. Machine-learned and statistical models showed that protein–N-glycan interactions highly correlate with stereoelectronic effects, and that a major part of protein–N-glycan interactions can be explained using the energetic rules of frontier molecular orbital interactions.

A nucleophilic gold complex

Solid-state auride salts featuring the negatively charged Au– ion are known to be stable in the presence of alkali metal counterions. While such electron-rich species might be expected to be nucleophilic (in the same manner as I–, for example), their instability in solution means that this has not been verified experimentally. Here we report a two-coordinate gold complex (NON)AlAuPtBu3 (where NON is the chelating tridentate ligand 4,5-bis(2,6-diisopropylanilido)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethylxanthene) that features a strongly polarized bond, Auδ––Alδ+. This is synthesized by reaction of the potassium aluminyl compound [K{Al(NON)}]2 with tBu3PAuI. Computational studies of the complex, including quantum theory of atoms in molecules charge analysis, imply a charge at gold (−0.82) that is in line with the relative electronegativities of the two metals (Au: 2.54; Al: 1.61 on the Pauling scale). Consistently, the complex is found to act as a nucleophilic source of gold, reacting with diisopropylcarbodiimide and CO2 to give the Au–C bonded insertion products (NON)Al(X2C)AuPtBu3 (X = NiPr, 4; X = O, 5). A two-coordinate monovalent gold complex that features a highly polarized aluminium–gold covalent bond, Alδ+–Auδ−, has been synthesized using a very strongly electron-donating aluminyl ligand. In solution, the complex reacts as a nucleophilic source of gold towards heteroallenes such as carbodiimides and CO2.

Electronic complementarity permits hindered butenolide heterodimerization and discovery of novel cGAS/STING pathway antagonists

sp3-hybridized attached-rings are common motifs in secondary metabolites and represent tetrahedral equivalents to the biaryl substructures that overpopulate synthetic libraries. Few methods are available that can link fully substituted carbon atoms of two rings with stereocontrol. Here we have developed a stereoselective, heteroselective butenolide coupling that exhibits an unusually fast rate of C–C bond formation driven by exquisite complementarity of the reacting π systems. Heterodimerization generates a compound collection with topological complexity and diverse principal moments of inertia. The special status of the sp3–sp3 attached-ring motif is demonstrated in a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes pathway, which recruited these butenolide heterodimers from a field of 250,000 compounds. The driving forces underlying this general attached-ring coupling identify a novel paradigm for the accession of wider natural product chemical space, accelerating the discovery of selective lead compounds. Although biaryl rings can be easily formed via cross coupling, their tetrahedral, high-fraction sp3 equivalents cannot. Now the scope, mechanism and biological profile of a general attached-ring synthesis has been probed. This provides direct access to full bridgehead substitution via sp3–sp3 coupling and enables rapid entry to natural product space.

The ribosome stabilizes partially folded intermediates of a nascent multi-domain protein

Co-translational folding is crucial to ensure the production of biologically active proteins. The ribosome can alter the folding pathways of nascent polypeptide chains, yet a structural understanding remains largely inaccessible experimentally. We have developed site-specific labelling of nascent chains to detect and measure, using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, multiple states accessed by an immunoglobulin-like domain within a tandem repeat protein during biosynthesis. By examining ribosomes arrested at different stages during translation of this common structural motif, we observe highly broadened NMR resonances attributable to two previously unidentified intermediates, which are stably populated across a wide folding transition. Using molecular dynamics simulations and corroborated by cryo-electron microscopy, we obtain models of these partially folded states, enabling experimental verification of a ribosome-binding site that contributes to their high stabilities. We thus demonstrate a mechanism by which the ribosome could thermodynamically regulate folding and other co-translational processes. Most proteins must fold co-translationally on the ribosome to adopt biologically active conformations, yet structural, mechanistic descriptions are lacking. Using 19F NMR spectroscopy to study a nascent multi-domain protein has now enabled the identification of two co-translational folding intermediates that are significantly more stable than intermediates formed off the ribosome, suggesting that the ribosome may thermodynamically regulate folding.

N-heterocyclic carbene-functionalized magic-number gold nanoclusters

Magic-number gold nanoclusters are atomically precise nanomaterials that have enabled unprecedented insight into structure–property relationships in nanoscience. Thiolates are the most common ligand, binding to the cluster via a staple motif in which only central gold atoms are in the metallic state. The lack of other strongly bound ligands for nanoclusters with different bonding modes has been a significant limitation in the field. Here, we report a previously unknown ligand for gold(0) nanoclusters—N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)—which feature a robust metal–carbon single bond and impart high stability to the corresponding gold cluster. The addition of a single NHC to gold nanoclusters results in significantly improved stability and catalytic properties in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. By varying the conditions, nature and number of equivalents of the NHC, predominantly or exclusively monosubstituted NHC-functionalized clusters result. Clusters can also be obtained with up to five NHCs, as a mixture of species. Magic-number Au11 clusters containing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands are prepared by ligand exchange on known phosphine clusters and the introduction of even a single NHC results in improved cluster stability. The use of NHC-containing clusters in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO is described and correlates with cluster stability.

Automated synthesis of prexasertib and derivatives enabled by continuous-flow solid-phase synthesis

Recent advances in end-to-end continuous-flow synthesis are rapidly expanding the capabilities of automated customized syntheses of small-molecule pharmacophores, resulting in considerable industrial and societal impacts; however, many hurdles persist that limit the number of sequential steps that can be achieved in such systems, including solvent and reagent incompatibility between individual steps, cumulated by-product formation, risk of clogging and mismatch of timescales between steps in a processing chain. To address these limitations, herein we report a strategy that merges solid-phase synthesis and continuous-flow operation, enabling push-button automated multistep syntheses of active pharmaceutical ingredients. We demonstrate our platform with a six-step synthesis of prexasertib in 65% isolated yield after 32 h of continuous execution. As there are no interactions between individual synthetic steps in the sequence, the established chemical recipe file was directly adopted or slightly modified for the synthesis of twenty-three prexasertib derivatives, enabling both automated early and late-stage diversification. Although strategies for the automated assembly of compounds of pharmaceutical relevance is a growing field of research, the synthesis of small-molecule pharmacophores remains a predominantly manual process. Now, an automated six-step synthesis of prexasertib is achieved by multistep solid-phase chemistry in a continuous-flow fashion using a chemical recipe file that enables automated scaffold modification through both early and late-stage diversification.

Chromopynones are pseudo natural product glucose uptake inhibitors targeting glucose transporters GLUT-1 and -3

The principles guiding the design and synthesis of bioactive compounds based on natural product (NP) structure, such as biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS), are limited by their partial coverage of the NP-like chemical space of existing NPs and retainment of bioactivity in the corresponding compound collections. Here we propose and validate a concept to overcome these limitations by de novo combination of NP-derived fragments to structurally unprecedented ‘pseudo natural products’. Pseudo NPs inherit characteristic elements of NP structure yet enable the efficient exploration of areas of chemical space not covered by NP-derived chemotypes, and may possess novel bioactivities. We provide a proof of principle by designing, synthesizing and investigating the biological properties of chromopynone pseudo NPs that combine biosynthetically unrelated chromane- and tetrahydropyrimidinone NP fragments. We show that chromopynones define a glucose uptake inhibitor chemotype that selectively targets glucose transporters GLUT-1 and -3, inhibits cancer cell growth and promises to inspire new drug discovery programmes aimed at tumour metabolism. New natural-product-inspired molecules are often limited by their only partial coverage of biologically relevant chemical space. Combining fragments of natural products has now been shown to yield pseudo natural products, which — while still being inspired by natural products — populate previously unexplored areas of chemical space and have novel biological activities.

An enzymatic platform for the asymmetric amination of primary, secondary and tertiary C(sp3)–H bonds

The ability to selectively functionalize ubiquitous C–H bonds streamlines the construction of complex molecular architectures from easily available precursors. Here we report enzyme catalysts derived from a cytochrome P450 that use a nitrene transfer mechanism for the enantioselective amination of primary, secondary and tertiary C(sp3)–H bonds. These fully genetically encoded enzymes are produced and function in bacteria, where they can be optimized by directed evolution for a broad spectrum of enantioselective C(sp3)–H amination reactions. These catalysts can aminate a variety of benzylic, allylic and aliphatic C–H bonds in excellent enantioselectivity with access to either antipode of product. Enantioselective amination of primary C(sp3)–H bonds in substrates that bear geminal dimethyl substituents furnished chiral amines that feature a quaternary stereocentre. Moreover, these enzymes enabled the enantioconvergent transformation of racemic substrates that possess a tertiary C(sp3)–H bond to afford products that bear a tetrasubstituted stereocentre, a process that has eluded small-molecule catalysts. Further engineering allowed for the enantioselective construction of methyl–ethyl stereocentres, which is notoriously challenging in asymmetric catalysis. Stereoselective functionalization of C(sp3)–H bonds could greatly simplify the construction of complex molecular scaffolds. Now, a series of enzyme catalysts derived from a cytochrome P450 have been developed using directed evolution. The catalysts enable the enantioselective amination of primary, secondary and tertiary C(sp3)–H bonds.

Chiral control of spin-crossover dynamics in Fe(II) complexes

Iron-based spin-crossover complexes hold tremendous promise as multifunctional switches in molecular devices. However, real-world technological applications require the excited high-spin state to be kinetically stable—a feature that has been achieved only at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate high-spin-state trapping by controlling the chiral configuration of the prototypical iron(II)tris(4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) in solution, associated for stereocontrol with the enantiopure Δ- or Λ-enantiomer of tris(3,4,5,6-tetrachlorobenzene-1,2-diolato-κ2O1,O2)phosphorus(V) (P(O2C6Cl4)3– or TRISPHAT) anions. We characterize the high-spin-state relaxation using broadband ultrafast circular dichroism spectroscopy in the deep ultraviolet in combination with transient absorption and anisotropy measurements. We find that the high-spin-state decay is accompanied by ultrafast changes of its optical activity, reflecting the coupling to a symmetry-breaking torsional twisting mode, contrary to the commonly assumed picture. The diastereoselective ion pairing suppresses the vibrational population of the identified reaction coordinate, thereby achieving a fourfold increase of the high-spin-state lifetime. More generally, our results motivate the synthetic control of the torsional modes of iron(II) complexes as a complementary route to manipulate their spin-crossover dynamics. Despite much research, the high-spin-state relaxation mechanism of Fe(II) spin-crossover complexes is unresolved. Using ultrafast circular dichroism spectroscopy it has now been revealed that the spin relaxation is driven by a torsional twisting mode, which breaks the chiral symmetry of a prototypical Fe(II) compound. Stereocontrolling the configuration of the complex can thus be used to slow down the spin relaxation.

Photoswitching neutral homoaromatic hydrocarbons

Homoaromatic compounds possess an interrupted π system but display aromatic properties due to through-space or through-bond interactions. Stable neutral homoaromatic hydrocarbons have remained rare and are typically unstable. Here we present the preparation of a class of stable neutral homoaromatic molecules, supported by experimental evidence (ring current observed by NMR spectroscopy and equalization of bond lengths by X-ray structure analysis) and computational analysis via nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) and anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID). We also show that one homoaromatic hydrocarbon is a photoswitch through a reversible photochemical [1, 11] sigmatropic rearrangement. Our computational analysis suggests that, upon photoswitching, the nature of the homoaromatic state changes in its perimeter from a more pronounced local 6π homoaromatic state to a global 10π homoaromatic state. These demonstrations of stable and accessible homoaromatic neutral hydrocarbons and their photoswitching behaviour provide new understanding and insights into the study of homoconjugative interactions in organic molecules, and for the design of new responsive molecular materials. Neutral homoaromatic hydrocarbons—which possess an interrupted π-system yet display aromatic properties owing to through-space or through-bond interactions—have remained rare as they are typically unstable. Now a class of stable neutral homoaromatic homoannulenes has been synthesized, including one that acts as a photoswitch through a reversible [1, 11] sigmatropic rearrangement.

Isolation, bonding and reactivity of a monomeric stibine oxide

In contrast to phosphine oxides and arsine oxides, which are common and exist as stable monomeric species featuring the corresponding pnictoryl functional group (Pn=O/Pn+–O−; Pn = P, As), stibine oxides are generally polymeric, and the properties of the unperturbed stiboryl group (Sb=O/Sb+–O−) remain unexplored. We now report the isolation of the monomeric stibine oxide, Dipp3SbO (where Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl). Spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational studies provide insight into the nature of the Sb=O/Sb+–O− bond. Moreover, isolation of Dipp3SbO allows the chemistry of the stiboryl group to be explored. Here we show that Dipp3SbO can act as a Brønsted base, a hydrogen-bond acceptor and a transition-metal ligand, in addition engaging in 1,2-addition, O-for-F2 exchange and O-atom transfer. In all cases, the reactivity of Dipp3SbO differed from that of the lighter congeners Dipp3AsO and Dipp3PO. In contrast to phosphine and arsine oxides, stibine oxides have been challenging to isolate in monomeric forms as they tend to polymerize. Now, such a SbO moiety has been kinetically stabilized using sterically bulky protecting groups, and its reactivity found to be substantially different to that of its lighter pnictogen counterparts.

De novo macrocyclic peptides that specifically modulate Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains

A promising approach in cancer therapy is to find ligands that directly bind ubiquitin (Ub) chains. However, finding molecules capable of tightly and specifically binding Ub chains is challenging given the range of Ub polymer lengths and linkages and their subtle structural differences. Here, we use total chemical synthesis of proteins to generate highly homogeneous Ub chains for screening against trillion-member macrocyclic peptide libraries (RaPID system). De novo cyclic peptides were found that can bind tightly and specifically to K48-linked Ub chains, confirmed by NMR studies. These cyclic peptides protected K48-linked Ub chains from deubiquitinating enzymes and prevented proteasomal degradation of Ub-tagged proteins. The cyclic peptides could enter cells, inhibit growth and induce programmed cell death, opening new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This highly synthetic approach, with both protein target generation and cyclic peptide discovery performed in vitro, will make other elaborate post-translationally modified targets accessible for drug discovery. Modulating particular ubiquitin chains using binding molecules is challenging given the diversity of chain lengths and linkages found in vivo. Now, tight binding modulators that are specific to K48-linked ubiquitin chains have been found by combining protein synthesis and screening of macrocyclic peptide ligands.

Experimental and computational evidence of halogen bonds involving astatine

The importance of halogen bonds—highly directional interactions between an electron-deficient σ-hole moiety in a halogenated compound and an acceptor such as a Lewis base—is being increasingly recognized in a wide variety of fields from biomedicinal chemistry to materials science. The heaviest halogens are known to form stronger halogen bonds, implying that if this trend continues down the periodic table, astatine should exhibit the highest halogen-bond donating ability. This may be mitigated, however, by the relativistic effects undergone by heavy elements, as illustrated by the metallic character of astatine. Here, the occurrence of halogen-bonding interactions involving astatine is experimentally evidenced. The complexation constants of astatine monoiodide with a series of organic ligands in cyclohexane solution were derived from distribution coefficient measurements and supported by relativistic quantum mechanical calculations. Taken together, the results show that astatine indeed behaves as a halogen-bond donor—a stronger one than iodine—owing to its much more electrophilic σ-hole. Halogen bonding is known to get stronger with increasing halogen polarizability, but some trends of the periodic table break down for heavy elements owing to relativistic effects. Now, through distribution coefficient measurements and relativistic quantum mechanical calculations, AtI has been shown to form stronger halogen bonds than I2—meaning that astatine conforms to the trend.

A dual role for a polyketide synthase in dynemicin enediyne and anthraquinone biosynthesis

Dynemicin A is a member of a subfamily of enediyne antitumour antibiotics characterized by a 10-membered carbocycle fused to an anthraquinone, both of polyketide origin. Sequencing of the dynemicin biosynthetic gene cluster in Micromonospora chersina previously identified an enediyne polyketide synthase (PKS), but no anthraquinone PKS, suggesting gene(s) for biosynthesis of the latter were distant from the core dynemicin cluster. To identify these gene(s), we sequenced and analysed the genome of M. chersina. Sequencing produced a short list of putative PKS candidates, yet CRISPR-Cas9 mutants of each locus retained dynemicin production. Subsequently, deletion of two cytochromes P450 in the dynemicin cluster suggested that the dynemicin enediyne PKS, DynE8, may biosynthesize the anthraquinone. Together with 18O-labelling studies, we now present evidence that DynE8 produces the core scaffolds of both the enediyne and anthraquinone, and provide a working model to account for their formation from the programmed octaketide of the enediyne PKS. The anthraquinone and enediyne halves of the antitumor antibiotic dynemicin A were previously thought to be assembled by two separate polyketide synthases (PKS). Now, a single polyketide synthase has been proposed to be responsible for their production, and a working model for their biosynthesis from a common octaketide intermediate has been suggested.

A general arene C–H functionalization strategy via electron donor–acceptor complex photoactivation

The photoactivation of electron donor–acceptor complexes has emerged as a sustainable, selective and versatile strategy for the generation of radical species. However, when it comes to aryl radical formation, this strategy remains hamstrung by the electronic properties of the aromatic radical precursors, and electron-deficient aryl halide acceptors are required. This has prevented the implementation of a general synthetic platform for aryl radical formation. Our study introduces triarylsulfonium salts as acceptors in photoactive electron donor–acceptor complexes, used in combination with catalytic amounts of newly designed amine donors. The sulfonium salt label renders inconsequential the electronic features of the aryl radical precursor and, more importantly, it is installed regioselectively in native aromatic compounds by C–H sulfenylation. Using this general, site-selective aromatic C–H functionalization approach, we developed metal-free protocols for the alkylation and cyanation of arenes, and showcased their application in both the synthesis and the late-stage modification of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Photoactivation of EDA complexes was previously limited to electronically biased partners to secure productive charge-transfer interactions. Now, the participation of triarylsulfonium salts—formed by selective C–H sulfenylation—in photoactive EDA complexes with catalytic triarylamine donors provides a site-selective and metal-free strategy for the generation of aryl radicals and the formal C–H functionalization of native arenes.

Title: 
Total synthesis of nine longiborneol sesquiterpenoids using a functionalized camphor strategy

Natural product total synthesis inspires the development of synthesis strategies to access important classes of molecules. In the 1960s, Corey and coworkers demonstrated a visionary preparation of the terpenoid longifolene, using ‘strategic bond analysis’ to craft a synthesis route. This approach proposes that efficient synthesis routes to bridged, polycyclic structures should be formulated to introduce the bulk of the target’s topological complexity at a late stage. Subsequently, similar strategies have proved general for the syntheses of a wide variety of bridged, polycyclic molecules. Here, we demonstrate that an orthogonal strategy where topological complexity is introduced at the outset leads to the short synthesis of the longifolene-related terpenoid longiborneol. To implement this strategy, we access a bicyclo[2.2.1] starting material through scaffold remodelling of readily available (S)-carvone. We also employ a variety of late-stage C–H functionalization tactics in divergent syntheses of many longiborneol congeners. Our strategy may prove effective for the preparation of other topologically complex natural products that contain the bicyclo[2.2.1] framework. Generating strategies that use modern synthetic methods to access privileged chemical space is a central goal of total synthesis. Now, a strategy that is orthogonal to classic approaches, coupled with C–H functionalization methods, leads to the shortest synthesis of the sesquiterpenoid longiborneol and divergent syntheses of oxygenated longiborneol congeners.

Oxidative cleavage of C–C bonds in lignin

Lignin is an aromatic polymer that constitutes up to 30 wt% of woody biomass and is considered the largest source of renewable aromatics. Valorization of the lignin stream is pivotal for making biorefining sustainable. Monomeric units in lignin are bound via C–O and C–C bonds. The majority of existing methods for the production of valuable compounds from lignin are based on the depolymerization of lignin via cleavage of relatively labile C–O bonds within lignin structure, which leads to yields of only 36–40 wt%. The remaining fraction (60 wt%) is a complex mixture of high-molecular-weight lignin, generally left unvalorized. Here we present a method to produce additional valuable monomers from the high-molecular-weight lignin fraction through oxidative C–C bond cleavage. This oxidation reaction proceeds with a high selectivity to give 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ) from high-molecular-weight lignin in 18 wt% yield, thus increasing the yield of monomers by 32%. This is an important step to make biorefining competitive with petroleum-based refineries. The valorization of lignin is generally implemented through the cleavage of labile C–O bonds to produce aromatic monomers in up to 40 wt% yield. The remaining material consists of lignin dimers and oligomers connected by C–C bonds, but now a method has been developed for the oxidative cleavage of these C–C bonds using oxoammonium salts, to produce benzoquinones.

Isolation of a Ru(iv) side-on peroxo intermediate in the water oxidation reaction

The electrons that nature uses to reduce CO2 during photosynthesis come from water oxidation at the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II. Molecular catalysts have served as models to understand its mechanism, in particular the O–O bond-forming reaction, which is still not fully understood. Here we report a Ru(iv) side-on peroxo complex that serves as a ‘missing link’ for the species that form after the rate-determining O–O bond-forming step. The Ru(iv) side-on peroxo complex (η2-1–OO) is generated from the isolated Ru(iv) oxo complex (1=O) in the presence of an excess of oxidant. The oxidation (iv) and spin state (singlet) of η2-1–OO were determined by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. 18O- and 2H-labelling studies evidence the direct evolution of O2 through the nucleophilic attack of a H2O molecule on the highly electrophilic metal–oxo species via the formation of η2-1–OO. These studies demonstrate water nucleophilic attack as a viable mechanism for O–O bond formation, as previously proposed based on indirect evidence. Obtaining mechanistic data after the rate-determining step of a chemical reaction is difficult but essential for its understanding. Now, a Ru(iv) side-on peroxo complex has been isolated following the rate-determining step of the water oxidation reaction (O–O bond formation) carried out using a Ru-based molecular catalyst.

Phase-specific RNA accumulation and duplex thermodynamics in multiphase coacervate models for membraneless organelles

Liquid–liquid phase separation has emerged as an important means of intracellular RNA compartmentalization. Some membraneless organelles host two or more compartments serving different putative biochemical roles. The mechanisms for, and functional consequences of, this subcompartmentalization are not yet well understood. Here we show that adjacent phases of decapeptide-based multiphase model membraneless organelles differ markedly in their interactions with RNA. Single- and double-stranded RNAs preferentially accumulate in different phases within the same droplet, and one phase is more destabilizing for RNA duplexes than the other. Single-phase peptide droplets did not capture this behaviour. Phase coexistence introduces new thermodynamic equilibria that alter RNA duplex stability and RNA sorting by hybridization state. These effects require neither biospecific RNA-binding sites nor full-length proteins. As such, they are more general and point to primitive versions of mechanisms operating in extant biology that could aid understanding and enable the design of functional artificial membraneless organelles. The biochemical roles and mechanisms of multiphase membraneless organelles are not yet well understood. Now, multiphase peptide droplets have been shown to sort RNA based on whether it is single- or double-stranded, as well as impact RNA duplexation through in-droplet thermodynamic equilibria. This work provides insight into possible primitive mechanisms for multicompartment intracellular condensates and can aid in the design of functional artificial membraneless organelles.

Designer DNA architecture offers precise and multivalent spatial pattern-recognition for viral sensing and inhibition

DNA, when folded into nanostructures with a specific shape, is capable of spacing and arranging binding sites into a complex geometric pattern with nanometre precision. Here we demonstrate a designer DNA nanostructure that can act as a template to display multiple binding motifs with precise spatial pattern-recognition properties, and that this approach can confer exceptional sensing and potent viral inhibitory capabilities. A star-shaped DNA architecture, carrying five molecular beacon-like motifs, was constructed to display ten dengue envelope protein domain III (ED3)-targeting aptamers into a two-dimensional pattern precisely matching the spatial arrangement of ED3 clusters on the dengue (DENV) viral surface. The resulting multivalent interactions provide high DENV-binding avidity. We show that this structure is a potent viral inhibitor and that it can act as a sensor by including a fluorescent output to report binding. Our molecular-platform design strategy could be adapted to detect and combat other disease-causing pathogens by generating the requisite ligand patterns on customized DNA nanoarchitectures. DNA is capable of self-assembling into a wide range of user-defined structures and so can be used as a scaffold to arrange binding motifs with nanometre precision. Now, DNA has been used to accurately display aptamers that fit the repeated epitope pattern of a dengue viral antigen to produce a nanostructure that can be a potent viral inhibitor or a fluorescent sensor.

Rapid phenolic O-glycosylation of small molecules and complex unprotected peptides in aqueous solvent

Glycosylated natural products and synthetic glycopeptides represent a significant and growing source of biochemical probes and therapeutic agents. However, methods that enable the aqueous glycosylation of endogenous amino acid functionality in peptides without the use of protecting groups are scarce. Here, we report a transformation that facilitates the efficient aqueous O-glycosylation of phenolic functionality in a wide range of small molecules, unprotected tyrosine, and tyrosine residues embedded within a range of complex, fully unprotected peptides. The transformation, which uses glycosyl fluoride donors and is promoted by Ca(OH)2, proceeds rapidly at room temperature in water, with good yields and selective formation of unique anomeric products depending on the stereochemistry of the glycosyl donor. High functional group tolerance is observed, and the phenol glycosylation occurs selectively in the presence of virtually all side chains of the proteinogenic amino acids with the singular exception of Cys. This method offers a highly selective, efficient, and operationally simple approach for the protecting-group-free synthesis of O-aryl glycosides and Tyr-O-glycosylated peptides in water. Glycosylation is an attractive strategy to functionalize natural products and peptides for biomedical use, but non-enzymatic approaches usually require organic solvent and protecting groups. Now, an aqueous phenolic O-glycosylation reaction that uses glycosyl fluoride donors and a calcium salt has been developed for a wide range of substrates, including complex unprotected peptides.

A ring expansion strategy towards diverse azaheterocycles

The development of innovative strategies for the synthesis of N-heterocyclic compounds is an important topic in organic synthesis. Ring expansion methods to form large N-heterocycles often involve the cycloaddition of strained aza rings with π bonds. However, in some cases such strategies suffer from some limitations owing to the difficulties in controlling the regioselectivity and the accessibility of specific π-bond synthons. Here, we report the development of a general ring expansion strategy that involves a formal cross-dimerization between three-membered aza heterocycles and three- and four-membered-ring ketones through synergistic bimetallic catalysis. These formal cross-dimerizations of two different strained rings are efficient and scalable, and provide a straightforward and broadly applicable means of assembling diverse N-heterocycles, such as 3-benzazepinones, dihydropyridinones and uracils, which are versatile units in numerous drugs and biologically active compounds. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the C–C bond of strained ring ketones is first cleaved by the Pd0 species during the reaction. Using synergistic bimetallic catalysis, a general ring expansion strategy has been developed for cross-dimerization between three-membered aza heterocycles and three- and four-membered-ring ketones. This method provides a straightforward and broadly applicable route for the assembly of 3-benzazepinones, dihydropyridinones and uracils, which are versatile units in numerous drugs and biologically active compounds.

Surface-exposed silver nanoclusters inside molecular metal oxide cavities

The surfaces of metal nanoclusters, including their interface with metal oxides, exhibit a high reactivity that is attractive for practical purposes. This high reactivity, however, has also hindered the synthesis of structurally well-defined hybrids of metal nanoclusters and metal oxides with exposed surfaces and/or interfaces. Here we report the sequential synthesis of structurally well-defined {Ag30} nanoclusters in the cavity of ring-shaped molecular metal oxides known as polyoxometalates. The {Ag30} nanoclusters possess exposed silver surfaces yet are stabilized both in solution and the solid state by the surrounding ring-shaped polyoxometalate species. The clusters underwent a redox-induced structural transformation without undesirable agglomeration or decomposition. Furthermore, {Ag30} nanoclusters showed high catalytic activity for the selective reduction of several organic functional groups using H2 under mild reaction conditions. We believe that these findings will serve for the discrete synthesis of surface-exposed metal nanoclusters stabilized by molecular metal oxides, which may in turn find applications in, for example, the fields of catalysis and energy conversion. Atomically precise metal nanoclusters can serve a variety of purposes, yet their high reactivity also makes them difficult to synthesize. Now, well-defined {Ag30} nanoclusters have been prepared within ring-shaped polyoxometalates. These nanoclusters show good stability in solution and the solid state, can undergo redox-induced structural transformation, and possess exposed surfaces that can serve as catalytically active sites.

Non-aqueous homogenous biocatalytic conversion of polysaccharides in ionic liquids using chemically modified glucosidase

The increasing requirement to produce platform chemicals and fuels from renewable sources means advances in biocatalysis are rapidly becoming a necessity. Biomass is widely used in nature as a source of energy and as chemical building blocks. However, recalcitrance towards traditional chemical processes and solvents provides a significant barrier to widespread utility. Here, by optimizing enzyme solubility in ionic liquids, we have discovered solvent-induced substrate promiscuity of glucosidase, demonstrating an unprecedented example of homogeneous enzyme bioprocessing of cellulose. Specifically, chemical modification of glucosidase for solubilization in ionic liquids can increase thermal stability to up to 137 °C, allowing for enzymatic activity 30 times greater than is possible in aqueous media. These results establish that through a synergistic combination of chemical biology (enzyme modification) and reaction engineering (solvent choice), the biocatalytic capability of enzymes can be intensified: a key step towards the full-scale deployment of industrial biocatalysis. As a consequence of high chemical resistance and low solubility in conventional solvents, deconstructing biomass into fuels and other useful chemical building blocks remains a challenge. Now, through enzyme modification and ionic liquid solvents, it is possible to homogeneously biocatalytically convert cellulose to sugars at a rate 30 times greater than is achievable in water.

Directional conformer exchange in dihydrofolate reductase revealed by single-molecule nanopore recordings

Conformational heterogeneity is emerging as a defining characteristic of enzyme function. However, understanding the role of protein conformations requires their thermodynamic and kinetic characterization at the single-molecule level, which remains extremely challenging. Here we report the ligand-induced conformational changes of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by measuring the modulation of the nanopore currents. The long observation time of the electrical recordings enabled the detection of rare conformational transitions hidden in ensemble measurements. We show that DHFR exists in at least four ground-state configurations or conformers with different affinities for its ligands. Unliganded DHFR adopted low-affinity conformers, whereas the binding of substrates promoted the switch to the high-affinity conformer. Conversion between the conformers was accelerated by molecules that stabilized the transition state of DHFR, which suggests that the reaction lowers the energy barrier for conformer exchange and thus facilitates product release. This mechanism might be a general feature in enzymatic reactions affected by product inhibition or when the release of products is the rate-limiting step. Single-molecule nanopore measurements have revealed ligand-induced conformational changes in the catalytic cycle of dihydrofolate reductase, and showed that the enzyme adopts distinctive conformers, which have different affinities for substrates and products. Crossing the transition state facilitates conformer exchange, suggesting that the chemical step catalyses the switch between conformers to obtain a more efficient product release.

Stereocontrolled 1,3-nitrogen migration to access chiral α-amino acids

α-Amino acids are essential for life as building blocks of proteins and components of diverse natural molecules. In both industry and academia, the incorporation of unnatural amino acids is often desirable for modulating chemical, physical and pharmaceutical properties. Here we report a protocol for the economical and practical synthesis of optically active α-amino acids based on an unprecedented stereocontrolled 1,3-nitrogen shift. Our method employs abundant and easily accessible carboxylic acids as starting materials, which are first connected to a nitrogenation reagent, followed by a highly regio- and enantioselective ruthenium- or iron-catalysed C(sp3)–H amination. This straightforward method displays a very broad scope, providing rapid access to optically active α-amino acids with aryl, allyl, propargyl and alkyl side chains, and also permits stereocontrolled late-stage amination of carboxylic-acid-containing drugs and natural products. A straightforward method for synthesizing optically active α-amino acids from abundant carboxylic acids has been developed. Based on a nitrene-mediated stereocontrolled 1,3-nitrogen shift, this approach provides access to a large variety of unnatural α-amino acids with aryl, allyl, propargyl and alkyl side chains and enables late-stage amination of carboxylic-acid-containing drugs.

Visible light-driven conjunctive olefination

Carboxylic acids and aldehydes are ubiquitous in chemistry and are native functionalities in many bioactive molecules and natural products. As such, a general cross-coupling process that involves these partners would open new avenues to achieve molecular diversity. Here we report a visible-light-mediated and transition metal-free conjunctive olefination that uses an alkene ‘linchpin’ with a defined geometry to cross-couple complex molecular scaffolds that contain carboxylic acids and aldehydes. The chemistry merges two cornerstones of organic synthesis—namely, the Wittig reaction and photoredox catalysis—in a catalytic cycle that couples a radical addition process with the redox generation of a phosphonium ylide. The methodology allows the rapid structural diversification of bioactive molecules and natural products in a native form, with a high functional group tolerance, and also forges a new alkene functional group with a programmable E–Z stereochemistry. A conjunctive olefination between aldehydes and carboxylic acids has been developed by merging photoredox catalysis with the Wittig reaction. The process uses a readily available phosphonium salt to join together complex molecular fragments with high functional group tolerance and minimal use of protecting groups, enabling access to coupling products with user-defined geometries.

Molecular interactions of FG nucleoporin repeats at high resolution

Proteins that contain repeat phenylalanine-glycine (FG) residues phase separate into oncogenic transcription factor condensates in malignant leukaemias, form the permeability barrier of the nuclear pore complex and mislocalize in neurodegenerative diseases. Insights into the molecular interactions of FG-repeat nucleoporins have, however, remained largely elusive. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and cryoelectron microscopy, we have identified uniformly spaced segments of transient β-structure and a stable preformed α-helix recognized by messenger RNA export factors in the FG-repeat domain of human nucleoporin 98 (Nup98). In addition, we have determined at high resolution the molecular organization of reversible FG–FG interactions in amyloid fibrils formed by a highly aggregation-prone segment in Nup98. We have further demonstrated that amyloid-like aggregates of the FG-repeat domain of Nup98 have low stability and are reversible. Our results provide critical insights into the molecular interactions underlying the self-association and phase separation of FG-repeat nucleoporins in physiological and pathological cell activities. Proteins rich in phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats can phase separate through FG–FG interactions. The molecular interactions of an important FG-repeat protein, nucleoporin 98, have now been studied in liquid-like transient and amyloid-like cohesive states. These interactions underlie the behaviour of FG-repeat proteins and their function in physiological and pathological cell activities.

A metal–organic framework that exhibits CO2-induced transitions between paramagnetism and ferrimagnetism

With adequate building blocks, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can combine magnetic ordering and porosity. This makes MOFs a promising platform for the development of stimuli-responsive materials that show drastically different magnetic properties depending on the presence or absence of guest molecules within their pores. Here we report a CO2-responsive magnetic MOF that converts from ferrimagnetic to paramagnetic on CO2 adsorption, and returns to the ferrimagnetic state on CO2 desorption. The ferrimagnetic material is a layered MOF with a [D+–A−–D] formula, produced from the reaction of trifluorobenzoate-bridged paddlewheel-type diruthenium(ii) clusters as the electron donor (D) with diethoxytetracyanoquinodimethane as the electron acceptor (A). On CO2 uptake, it undergoes an in-plane electron transfer and a structural transition to adopt a [D–A–D] paramagnetic form. This magnetic phase change, and the accompanying modifications to the electronic conductivity and permittivity of the MOF, are electronically stabilized by the guest CO2 molecules accommodated in the framework. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can combine porosity and magnetic order within their lattice, which makes them attractive for the development of stimuli-responsive magnets. Now, a MOF has been prepared that converts from a ferrimagnet to a paramagnet with CO2 uptake, and returns to the ferrimagnetic state on releasing CO2.

Iridium single-atom catalyst on nitrogen-doped carbon for formic acid oxidation synthesized using a general host–guest strategy

Single-atom catalysts not only maximize metal atom efficiency, they also display properties that are considerably different to their more conventional nanoparticle equivalents, making them a promising family of materials to investigate. Herein we developed a general host–guest strategy to fabricate various metal single-atom catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon (M1/CN, M = Pt, Ir, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni, Mn). The iridium variant Ir1/CN electrocatalyses the formic acid oxidation reaction with a mass activity of 12.9 $${{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}$$ whereas an Ir/C nanoparticle catalyst is almost inert (~4.8 × 10−3 $${{{\rm{A}}\,{\rm{mg}}^{-1}_{{\rm{Ir}}}}}$$). The activity of Ir1/CN is also 16 and 19 times greater than those of Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively. Furthermore, Ir1/CN displays high tolerance to CO poisoning. First-principle density functional theory reveals that the properties of Ir1/CN stem from the spatial isolation of iridium sites and from the modified electronic structure of iridium with respect to a conventional nanoparticle catalyst. Single-atom catalysts maximize metal atom efficiency and exhibit properties that can be considerably different to their nanoparticle equivalent. Now a general host–guest strategy to make various single-atom catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon has been developed; the iridium variant electrocatalyses the formic acid oxidation reaction with high mass activity and displays high tolerance to CO poisoning.

Formation of carbon–nitrogen bonds in carbon monoxide electrolysis

The electroreduction of CO2 is a promising technology for carbon utilization. Although electrolysis of CO2 or CO2-derived CO can generate important industrial multicarbon feedstocks such as ethylene, ethanol, n-propanol and acetate, most efforts have been devoted to promoting C–C bond formation. Here, we demonstrate that C–N bonds can be formed through co-electrolysis of CO and NH3 with acetamide selectivity of nearly 40% at industrially relevant reaction rates. Full-solvent quantum mechanical calculations show that acetamide forms through nucleophilic addition of NH3 to a surface-bound ketene intermediate, a step that is in competition with OH– addition, which leads to acetate. The C–N formation mechanism was successfully extended to a series of amide products through amine nucleophilic attack on the ketene intermediate. This strategy enables us to form carbon–heteroatom bonds through the electroreduction of CO, expanding the scope of products available from CO2 reduction. The electroreduction of CO2-derived CO is a promising technology for the sustainable production of value-added chemicals. Now, it is shown how C–N bonds can be formed electrochemically through CO electroreduction on a Cu surface in the presence of amines. The formation of acetamides is observed through nucleophilic addition to a ketene intermediate.

The energy-transfer-enabled biocompatible disulfide–ene reaction

Sulfur-containing molecules participate in many essential biological processes. Of utmost importance is the methylthioether moiety, present in the proteinogenic amino acid methionine and installed in tRNA by radical-S-adenosylmethionine methylthiotransferases. Although the thiol–ene reaction for carbon–sulfur bond formation has found widespread applications in materials or medicinal science, a biocompatible chemo- and regioselective hydrothiolation of unactivated alkenes and alkynes remains elusive. Here, we describe the design of a general chemoselective anti-Markovnikov hydroalkyl/aryl thiolation of alkenes and alkynes—also allowing the biologically important hydromethylthiolation—by triplet–triplet energy transfer activation of disulfides. This fast disulfide–ene reaction shows extraordinary functional group tolerance and biocompatibility. Transient absorption spectroscopy was used to study the sensitization process in detail. The hereby gained mechanistic insights were successfully employed for optimization of the catalytic system. This photosensitized transformation should stimulate bioimaging applications and carbon–sulfur bond-forming late-stage functionalization chemistry, especially in the context of metabolic labelling. Triplet–triplet energy transfer activation of disulfides enables the chemoselective anti-Markovnikov hydroalkyl/aryl thiolation of alkenes and alkynes—and can also be used for the biologically important hydromethylthiolation reaction. This fast disulfide–ene reaction is biocompatible and is tolerant of a wide range of functional groups. The triplet–triplet energy transfer sensitization process was studied in detail with transient absorption spectroscopy.

A biomimetic receptor for glucose

Specific molecular recognition is routine for biology, but has proved difficult to achieve in synthetic systems. Carbohydrate substrates are especially challenging, because of their diversity and similarity to water, the biological solvent. Here we report a synthetic receptor for glucose, which is biomimetic in both design and capabilities. The core structure is simple and symmetrical, yet provides a cavity which almost perfectly complements the all-equatorial β-pyranoside substrate. The receptor’s affinity for glucose, at Ka ~ 18,000 M−1, compares well with natural receptor systems. Selectivities also reach biological levels. Most other saccharides are bound approximately 100 times more weakly, while non-carbohydrate substrates are ignored. Glucose-binding molecules are required for initiatives in diabetes treatment, such as continuous glucose monitoring and glucose-responsive insulin. The performance and tunability of this system augur well for such applications. Synthetic receptors can be used to help understand biological systems, but rarely compete in terms of affinity or selectivity. Now, a glucose-binding compound has been prepared that, despite its symmetry and simplicity, can match all but the strongest glucose-binding proteins. The high binding affinity and outstanding selectivity of this receptor may translate into biomedical applications.

Synthesis of azetidines via visible-light-mediated intermolecular [2+2] photocycloadditions

Intermolecular [2+2] photocycloadditions represent a powerful method for the synthesis of highly strained, four-membered rings. Although this approach is commonly employed for the synthesis of oxetanes and cyclobutanes, the synthesis of azetidines via intermolecular aza Paternò–Büchi reactions remains highly underdeveloped. Here we report a visible-light-mediated intermolecular aza Paternò–Büchi reaction that utilizes the unique triplet state reactivity of oximes, specifically 2-isoxazoline-3-carboxylates. The reactivity of this class of oximes can be harnessed via the triplet energy transfer from a commercially available iridium photocatalyst and allows for [2+2] cycloaddition with a wide range of alkenes. This approach is characterized by its operational simplicity, mild conditions and broad scope, and allows for the synthesis of highly functionalized azetidines from readily available precursors. Importantly, the accessible azetidine products can be readily converted into free, unprotected azetidines, which represents a new approach to access these highly desirable synthetic targets. Although azetidines represent highly desirable building blocks in drug discovery, methods for their efficient and straightforward synthesis remain underdeveloped. Now, it has been shown that highly functionalized azetidines can be prepared via an intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction between cyclic oximes and alkenes, in a process enabled by a visible-light-mediated triplet energy transfer.

Digital micelles of encoded polymeric amphiphiles for direct sequence reading and ex vivo label-free quantification

Identification and quantification of synthetic polymers in complex biological milieu are crucial for delivery, sensing and scaffolding functions, but conventional techniques based on imaging probe labellings only afford qualitative results. Here we report modular construction of precise sequence-defined amphiphilic polymers that self-assemble into digital micelles with contour lengths strictly regulated by oligourethane sequences. Direct sequence reading is accomplished with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) tandem mass spectrometry, facilitated by high-affinity binding of alkali metal ions with poly(ethylene glycol) dendrons and selective cleavage of benzyl-carbamate linkages. A mixture of four types of digital micelles could be identified, sequence-decoded and quantified by MALDI and MALDI imaging at cellular, organ and tissue slice levels upon in vivo administration, enabling direct comparison of biological properties for each type of digital micelle in the same animal. The concept of digital micelles and encoded amphiphiles capable of direct sequencing and high-throughput label-free quantification could be exploited for next-generation precision nanomedicine designs (such as digital lipids) and protein corona studies. Identifying and quantifying the biodistribution of synthetic polymeric nanoparticles in biological milieu is crucial for biomedical applications. Now, it has been shown that encoded polymeric amphiphiles with discrete molar masses undergo sequence- and length-dependent self-assembly into precise digital micelles that can be used in direct sequence reading and ex vivo label-free quantification assays.

Synthesis of a low-valent Al4+ cluster cation salt

Low-valent aluminium compounds are very reactive main-group species and have therefore been widely investigated. Since the isolation of a stable molecular Al(I) compound in 1991, [(AlCp*)4] (Cp* = [C5Me5]–), a variety of highly reactive neutral or anionic low-valent aluminium complexes have been developed. By contrast, their cationic counterparts have remained difficult to access. Here, we report the synthesis of [Al(AlCp*)3]+[Al(ORF)4]– (RF = C(CF3)3) through a simple metathesis reaction between [(AlCp*)4] and Li[Al(ORF)4]. Unexpectedly, the [Al(AlCp*)3]+ salt forms a dimer in the solid state and concentrated solutions. Addition of Lewis bases results in monomerization and coordination to the unique formal Al+ atom, giving [(L)xAl(AlCp*)3]+ salts where L is hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane (x = 1), tetramethylethylenediamine (x = 1) or 4-dimethylaminopyridine (x = 3). The Al+–AlCp* bonds in the resulting [(L)xAl(AlCp*)3]+ cluster cations can be finely tuned between very strong (with no ligand L) to very weak and approaching isolated [Al(L)3]+ ions (when L is dimethylaminopyridine). Although neutral and anionic low-valent aluminium complexes are widespread, their cationic counterparts have remained rare. Now, a salt of [Al(AlCp*)3]+ featuring a formal low-valent Al+ cation has been isolated that dimerizes in concentrated solutions and the solid state, and also forms Al4 clusters on coordinating with Lewis bases.

Fast galvanic lithium corrosion involving a Kirkendall-type mechanism

Developing a viable metallic lithium anode is a prerequisite for next-generation batteries. However, the low redox potential of lithium metal renders it prone to corrosion, which must be thoroughly understood for it to be used in practical energy-storage devices. Here we report a previously overlooked mechanism by which lithium deposits can corrode on a copper surface. Voids are observed in the corroded deposits and a Kirkendall-type mechanism is validated through electrochemical analysis. Although it is a long-held view that lithium corrosion in electrolytes involves direct charge-transfer through the lithium–electrolyte interphase, the corrosion observed here is found to be governed by a galvanic process between lithium and the copper substrate—a pathway largely neglected by previous battery corrosion studies. The observations are further rationalized by detailed analyses of the solid–electrolyte interphase formed on copper and lithium, where the disparities in electrolyte reduction kinetics on the two surfaces can account for the fast galvanic process. Developing a stable metallic lithium anode is necessary for next-generation batteries; however, lithium is prone to corrosion, a process that must be better understood if practical devices are to be created. A Kirkendall-type mechanism of lithium corrosion has now been observed. The corrosion is fast and is governed by a galvanic process.

Gas-phase sugar formation using hydroxymethylene as the reactive formaldehyde isomer

Carbohydrates (CH2O)n are the formal adducts of carbon (atoms) to water with a repeating unit that structurally resembles H–C̈–OH (hydroxymethylene). Although hydroxymethylene has been suggested as a building block for sugar formation, it is a reactive species that had escaped detection until recently. Here we demonstrate that formaldehyde reacts with its isomer hydroxymethylene to give glycolaldehyde in a nearly barrierless reaction. This carbonyl–ene-type transformation operates in the absence of base and solvent at cryogenic temperatures similar to those found in extraterrestrial environments or interstellar clouds. Hydroxymethylene acts as a building block for an iterative sugar synthesis, as we demonstrate through the formation of the triose glyceraldehyde. The thermodynamically preferred ketose dihydroxyacetone does not form, and the formation of further branched sugars in the iterative synthesis presented here is unlikely. The results therefore provide a link between the well-known formose (Butlerow) reaction and sugar formation under non-aqueous conditions. The simplest sugar—glycolaldehyde—has recently been detected in space and now a mechanistic rationale for its formation is presented, which includes its onward reaction to the next higher aldose, glyceraldehyde. The key species in the chemistry at play is the formaldehyde isomer hydroxymethylene, which reacts with the carbonyl component in an essentially barrierless carbonyl–ene-type reaction.

Title: 
An RNA-cleaving threose nucleic acid enzyme capable of single point mutation discrimination

Threose nucleic acid has been considered a potential evolutionary progenitor of RNA because of its chemical simplicity, base pairing properties and capacity for higher-order functions such as folding and specific ligand binding. Here we report the in vitro selection of RNA-cleaving threose nucleic acid enzymes. One such enzyme, Tz1, catalyses a site-specific RNA-cleavage reaction with an observed pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) of 0.016 min−1. The catalytic activity of Tz1 is maximal at 8 mM Mg2+ and remains relatively constant from pH 5.3 to 9.0. Tz1 preferentially cleaves a mutant epidermal growth factor receptor RNA substrate with a single point substitution, while leaving the wild-type intact. We demonstrate that Tz1 mediates selective gene silencing of the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor in eukaryotic cells. The identification of catalytic threose nucleic acids provides further experimental support for threose nucleic acid as an ancestral genetic and functional material. The demonstration of Tz1 mediating selective knockdown of intracellular RNA suggests that functional threose nucleic acids could be developed for future biomedical applications. Threose nucleic acid (TNA) is a potential RNA evolutionary progenitor and a nuclease-resistant synthetic genetic polymer. Now, a TNA catalyst that cleaves RNA has been identified in vitro. The TNA catalyst shows strong sequence selectivity towards a mutant RNA substrate involved in drug resistance, resulting in selective gene silencing in eukaryotic cells.

Title: 
Acyltransferase that catalyses the condensation of polyketide and peptide moieties of goadvionin hybrid lipopeptides

Fusions of fatty acids and peptides expand the structural diversity of natural products; however, polyketide/ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (PK/RiPPs) hybrid lipopeptides are relatively rare. Here we report a family of PK/RiPPs called goadvionins, which inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, and an acyltransferase, GdvG, which catalyses the condensation of the PK and RiPP moieties. Goadvionin comprises a trimethylammonio 32-carbon acyl chain and an eight-residue RiPP with an avionin structure. The positions of six hydroxyl groups and one double bond in the very-long acyl chain were determined by radical-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry, which collides radical ion species to generate C–C bond cleavage fragments. GdvG belongs to the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily. Unlike conventional acyltransferases, GdvG transfers a very long acyl chain that is tethered to an acyl carrier protein to the N-terminal amino group of the RiPP moiety. gdvG homologues flanked by PK/fatty acid and RiPP biosynthesis genes are widely distributed in microbial species, suggesting that acyltransferase-catalysed condensation of PKs and RiPPs is a general strategy in biosynthesis of similar lipopeptides. The biosynthesis of goadvionins—hybrid lipopeptide antibiotics—is not fully understood. An unusual acyltransferase, GdvG, has now been identified and shown to catalyse a condensation reaction between an acyl-carrier-protein-tethered very-long-chain fatty acid and an eight-residue ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide. The position of functional groups in the very-long acyl chain have been determined by tandem mass spectrometry.

Mechanism-based ligand design for copper-catalysed enantioconvergent C(sp3)–C(sp) cross-coupling of tertiary electrophiles with alkynes

In contrast with the well-established enantioconvergent radical C(sp3)–C cross-coupling of racemic secondary alkyl electrophiles, the corresponding coupling of tertiary electrophiles to forge all-carbon quaternary stereocentres remains underexplored. The major challenge arises from the steric hindrance and the difficult enantio-differentiation of three distinct carbon substituents of prochiral tertiary radicals. Here we demonstrate a general copper-catalysed enantioconvergent C(sp3)–C(sp) cross-coupling of diverse racemic tertiary alkyl halides with terminal alkynes (87 examples). Key to the success is the rational design of chiral anionic N,N,N-ligands tailor-made for the computationally predicted outer-sphere radical group transfer pathway. This protocol provides a practical platform for the construction of chiral C(sp3)–C(sp/sp2/sp3) bonds, allowing for expedient access to an array of synthetically challenging quaternary carbon building blocks of interest in organic synthesis and related areas. A general copper-catalysed enantioconvergent C(sp3)–C(sp) cross-coupling of diverse racemic tertiary alkyl halides with terminal alkynes has been developed, forging all-carbon quaternary stereocentres.

Mechanochemical synthesis of an elusive fluorinated polyacetylene

Polymer mechanochemistry has traditionally been employed to study the effects of mechanical force on chemical bonds within a polymer backbone or to generate force-responsive materials. It is under-exploited for the scalable synthesis of wholly new materials by chemically transforming the polymers, especially products inaccessible by other means. Here we utilize polymer mechanochemistry to synthesize a fluorinated polyacetylene, a long-sought-after air-stable polyacetylene that has eluded synthesis by conventional means. We construct the monomer in four chemical steps on gram scale, which involves a rapid incorporation of fluorine atoms in an exotic photochemical cascade whose mechanism and exquisite stereoselectivity were informed by computation. After polymerization, force activation by ultrasonication produces a gold-coloured, semiconducting fluoropolymer. This work demonstrates that polymer mechanochemistry is a valuable synthetic tool for accessing materials on a preparative scale. Fluorinated polyacetylene has typically proven to be inaccessible using traditional polymer synthesis, but there is much interest in its predicted properties. Now, a mechanochemical unzipping strategy has succeeded in the synthesis of a gold-coloured, semiconducting fluorinated polyacetylene with improved stability in air compared to polyacetylene.

In vivo metallophilic self-assembly of a light-activated anticancer drug

Self-assembling molecular drugs combine the easy preparation typical of small-molecule chemotherapy and the tumour-targeting properties of drug–nanoparticle conjugates. However, they require a supramolecular interaction that survives the complex environment of a living animal. Here we report that the metallophilic interaction between cyclometalated palladium complexes generates supramolecular nanostructures in living mice that have a long circulation time (over 12 h) and efficient tumour accumulation rate (up to 10.2% of the injected dose per gram) in a skin melanoma tumour model. Green light activation leads to efficient tumour destruction due to the type I photodynamic effect generated by the self-assembled palladium complexes, as demonstrated in vitro by an up to 96-fold cytotoxicity increase upon irradiation. This work demonstrates that metallophilic interactions are well suited to generating stable supramolecular nanotherapeutics in vivo with exceptional tumour-targeting properties. The metallophilic interaction between cyclometalated palladium complexes can facilitate supramolecular nanostructure formation in living mice, providing a phototoxic prodrug with a long circulation time and high tumour-targeting efficiency. Upon green light irradiation, this palladium-based drug destroys solid tumours, leaving non-irradiated organs intact.

Radical polymerization inside living cells

Polymerization reactions conducted inside cells must be compatible with the complex intracellular environment, which contains numerous molecules and functional groups that could potentially prevent or quench polymerization reactions. Here we report a strategy for directly synthesizing unnatural polymers in cells through free radical photopolymerization using a number of biocompatible acrylic and methacrylic monomers. This offers a platform to manipulate, track and control cellular behaviour by the in cellulo generation of macromolecules that have the ability to alter cellular motility, label cells by the generation of fluorescent polymers for long-term tracking studies, as well as generate a variety of nanostructures within cells. It is remarkable that free radical polymerization chemistry can take place within such complex cellular environments. This demonstration opens up a multitude of new possibilities for how chemists can modulate cellular function and behaviour and for understanding cellular behaviour in response to the generation of free radicals. A strategy for directly synthesizing unnatural polymers in cells through radical polymerization has now been developed. This approach provides a platform to manipulate, track and control cellular behaviour by the in cellulo generation of macromolecules and a variety of nanostructures.

Title: 
Evaluating differences in the active-site electronics of supported Au nanoparticle catalysts using Hammett and DFT studies

Supported metal catalysts, which are composed of metal nanoparticles dispersed on metal oxides or other high-surface-area materials, are ubiquitous in industrially catalysed reactions. Identifying and characterizing the catalytic active sites on these materials still remains a substantial challenge, even though it is required to guide rational design of practical heterogeneous catalysts. Metal–support interactions have an enormous impact on the chemistry of the catalytic active site and can determine the optimum support for a reaction; however, few direct probes of these interactions are available. Here we show how benzyl alcohol oxidation Hammett studies can be used to characterize differences in the catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles hosted on various metal-oxide supports. We combine reactivity analysis with density functional theory calculations to demonstrate that the slope of experimental Hammett plots is affected by electron donation from the underlying oxide support to the Au particles. Understanding how a supporting material can change the surface chemistry of the nanoparticle catalysts that it hosts is critical to tuning catalytic properties. Experimental Hammett studies and density functional theory calculations show that differences in reactivity can be attributed to differences in the electron density at metal active sites, which arises from differences in electron donation from the support.

Modification and de novo design of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases using specific assembly points within condensation domains

Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are giant enzyme machines that activate amino acids in an assembly line fashion. As NRPSs are not restricted to the incorporation of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, their efficient manipulation would enable microbial production of a diverse range of peptides; however, the structural requirements for reprogramming NRPSs to facilitate the production of new peptides are not clear. Here we describe a new fusion point inside the condensation domains of NRPSs that results in the development of the exchange unit condensation domain (XUC) concept, which enables the efficient production of peptides, even containing non-natural amino acids, in yields up to 280 mg l−1. This allows the generation of more specific NRPSs, reducing the number of unwanted peptide derivatives, but also the generation of peptide libraries. The XUC might therefore be suitable for the future optimization of peptide production and the identification of bioactive peptide derivatives for pharmaceutical and other applications. Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases have now been modified and de novo non-ribosomal peptide synthetases constructed using new assembly points within condensation domains. This approach enabled the production of new-to-nature peptides, including some carrying synthetic amino acids, as well as the generation of peptide libraries.

Title: 
Nickel-catalysed anti-Markovnikov hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes with unactivated arenes facilitated by non-covalent interactions

Anti-Markovnikov additions to alkenes have been a longstanding goal of catalysis, and anti-Markovnikov addition of arenes to alkenes would produce alkylarenes that are distinct from those formed by acid-catalysed processes. Existing hydroarylations are either directed or occur with low reactivity and low regioselectivity for the n-alkylarene. Herein, we report the first undirected hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes with unactivated arenes that occurs with high regioselectivity for the anti-Markovnikov product. The reaction occurs with a nickel catalyst ligated by a highly sterically hindered N-heterocyclic carbene. Catalytically relevant arene- and alkene-bound nickel complexes have been characterized, and the rate-limiting step was shown to be reductive elimination to form the C–C bond. Density functional theory calculations, combined with second-generation absolutely localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis, suggest that the difference in activity between catalysts containing large and small carbenes results more from stabilizing intramolecular non-covalent interactions in the secondary coordination sphere than from steric hindrance. The anti-Markovnikov hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes with unactivated arenes has been achieved with high selectivity by using nickel catalysts bearing large N-heterocyclic carbene ligands. Energy decomposition analysis indicates that the high activity of the catalysts with large carbene ligands arises from stabilizing non-covalent interactions rather than steric effects.

Reagentless biomolecular analysis using a molecular pendulum

The development of reagentless sensors that can detect molecular analytes in biological fluids could enable a broad range of applications in personalized health monitoring. However, only a limited set of molecular inputs can currently be detected using reagentless sensors. Here, we report a sensing mechanism that is compatible with the analysis of proteins that are important physiological markers of stress, allergy, cardiovascular health, inflammation and cancer. The sensing method is based on the motion of an inverted molecular pendulum that exhibits field-induced transport modulated by the presence of a bound analyte. We measure the sensor’s electric field-mediated transport using the electron-transfer kinetics of an attached reporter molecule. Using time-resolved electrochemical measurements that enable unidirectional motion of our sensor, the presence of an analyte bound to our sensor complex can be tracked continuously in real time. We show that this sensing approach is compatible with making measurements in blood, saliva, urine, tears and sweat and that the sensors can collect data in situ in living animals. A reagentless method for detecting analytes based on the motion of an inverted molecular pendulum has now been developed. The sensor is capable of detecting important physiological markers of stress, allergy, cardiovascular health, inflammation and cancer and works in blood, saliva, urine, tears and sweat. The sensor is also capable of collecting data in living animals.

Cellular uptake of large biomolecules enabled by cell-surface-reactive cell-penetrating peptide additives

Enabling the cellular delivery and cytosolic bioavailability of functional proteins constitutes a major challenge for the life sciences. Here we demonstrate that thiol-reactive arginine-rich peptide additives can enhance the cellular uptake of protein–CPP conjugates in a non-endocytic mode, even at low micromolar concentration. We show that such thiol- or HaloTag-reactive additives can result in covalently anchored CPPs on the cell surface, which are highly effective at co-delivering protein cargoes. Taking advantage of the thiol reactivity of our most effective CPP additive, we show that Cys-containing proteins can be readily delivered into the cytosol by simple co-addition of a slight excess of this CPP. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of our ‘CPP-additive technique’ in the delivery of functional enzymes, nanobodies and full-length immunoglobulin-G antibodies. This new cellular uptake protocol greatly simplifies both the accessibility and efficiency of protein and antibody delivery, with minimal chemical or genetic engineering. Robust delivery of proteins into cells is challenging, but it has now been shown that by conjugating arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides to the surface of cells, proteins containing a cell-penetrating peptide can be delivered efficiently into them. Using a thiol-reactive cell-penetrating peptide enables thiol-containing proteins to be delivered by simple co-incubation.

Tricyclic cell-penetrating peptides for efficient delivery of functional antibodies into cancer cells

The intracellular environment hosts a large number of cancer- and other disease-relevant human proteins. Targeting these with internalized antibodies would allow therapeutic modulation of hitherto undruggable pathways, such as those mediated by protein–protein interactions. However, one of the major obstacles in intracellular targeting is the entrapment of biomacromolecules in the endosome. Here we report an approach to delivering antibodies and antibody fragments into the cytosol and nucleus of cells using trimeric cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). Four trimers, based on linear and cyclic sequences of the archetypal CPP Tat, are significantly more potent than monomers and can be tuned to function by direct interaction with the plasma membrane or escape from vesicle-like bodies. These studies identify a tricyclic Tat construct that enables intracellular delivery of functional immunoglobulin-G antibodies and Fab fragments that bind intracellular targets in the cytosol and nuclei of live cells at effective concentrations as low as 1 μM. Reliable intracellular delivery of antibodies is one of the grand challenges in biomedical research, with the potential to address unmet clinical needs or to enable basic research. Now, it has been shown that tricyclic peptide complexes can transport functional antibodies into the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells to specifically target intracellular proteins.

Title: 
Nonribosomal biosynthesis of backbone-modified peptides

Biosynthetic modification of nonribosomal peptide backbones represents a potentially powerful strategy to modulate the structure and properties of an important class of therapeutics. Using a high-throughput assay for catalytic activity, we show here that an L-Phe-specific module of an archetypal nonribosomal peptide synthetase can be reprogrammed to accept and process the backbone-modified amino acid (S)-β-Phe with near-native specificity and efficiency. A co-crystal structure with a non-hydrolysable aminoacyl-AMP analogue reveals the origins of the 40,000-fold α/β-specificity switch, illuminating subtle but precise remodelling of the active site. When the engineered catalyst was paired with downstream module(s), (S)-β-Phe-containing peptides were produced at preparative scale in vitro (~1 mmol) and high titres in vivo (~100 mg l–1), highlighting the potential of biosynthetic pathway engineering for the construction of novel nonribosomal β-frameworks. Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) produce vital natural products but have proven recalcitrant to biosynthetic engineering. Now, a combination of yeast surface display and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) has been used to reprogram an L-Phe-incorporating module for β-Phe. The resulting module is highly selective and functions efficiently in NRPS pathways.

Rechargeable-battery chemistry based on lithium oxide growth through nitrate anion redox

Next-generation lithium-battery cathodes often involve the growth of lithium-rich phases, which enable specific capacities that are 2−3 times higher than insertion cathode materials, such as lithium cobalt oxide. Here, we investigated battery chemistry previously deemed irreversible in which lithium oxide, a lithium-rich phase, grows through the reduction of the nitrate anion in a lithium nitrate-based molten salt at 150 °C. Using a suite of independent characterization techniques, we demonstrated that a Ni nanoparticle catalyst enables the reversible growth and dissolution of micrometre-sized lithium oxide crystals through the effective catalysis of nitrate reduction and nitrite oxidation, which results in high cathode areal capacities (~12 mAh cm–2). These results enable a rechargeable battery system that has a full-cell theoretical specific energy of 1,579 Wh kg–1, in which a molten nitrate salt serves as both an active material and the electrolyte. Phase-forming conversion chemistry, like that observed in Li–S and Li–O2 batteries, shows great promise, but these systems suffer some drawbacks, such as practically low cathode areal capacities and electrolyte decomposition. Now, high-energy conversion battery chemistry—based on nitrate/nitrite redox where one of the products is soluble—has been enabled by using nanoparticulate Ni/NiO electrocatalysts.

Title: 
An alkyl-substituted aluminium anion with strong basicity and nucleophilicity

Aluminium anions with an unoccupied orbital are generally considered as highly difficult synthetic targets, as aluminium is the most electropositive element in the p block. Stabilizing effects from two nitrogen substituents and/or the coordination of a Lewis base were recently used to synthesize the first examples of anionic nucleophilic aluminium species. Here we show the synthesis and properties of a potassium salt of a non-stabilized dialkylaluminium anion that exhibits very strong basicity, which reflects the electropositive character of aluminium. An X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a monomeric structure and the shortest Al–K distance hitherto reported. The ultraviolet visible spectrum in combination with density functional theory calculations suggests an electronic structure characterized by a lone pair of electrons and an unoccupied p orbital on the aluminium centre. This species readily deprotonates benzene to form the corresponding (hydrido)(phenyl)aluminate. Reactions with other electrophiles corroborate the nucleophilicity of the aluminium centre. Owing to the electropositive character of aluminium it is difficult to prepare Al anions; the few that exist are supported by nitrogen ligands. Now, a dialkyl-alumanyl anion has been synthesized that features a polar Al–K bond. This anion reacts as a very strong base that deprotonates benzene, and undergoes nucleophilic substitution reactions.

Cyclometallated ruthenium catalyst enables late-stage directed arylation of pharmaceuticals

Biaryls are ubiquitous core structures in drugs, agrochemicals and organic materials that have profoundly improved many aspects of our society. Although traditional cross-couplings have made practical the synthesis of many biaryls, C–H arylation represents a more attractive and cost-effective strategy for building these structural motifs. Furthermore, the ability to install biaryl units in complex molecules via late-stage C–H arylation would allow access to valuable structural diversity, novel chemical space and intellectual property in only one step. However, known C–H arylation protocols are not suitable for substrates decorated with polar and delicate functionalities, which are commonly found in molecules that possess biological activity. Here we introduce a class of ruthenium catalysts that display a unique efficacy towards late-stage arylation of heavily functionalized substrates. The design and development of this class of catalysts was enabled by a mechanistic breakthrough on the Ru(ii)-catalysed C–H arylation of N–chelating substrates with aryl (pseudo)halides, which has remained poorly understood for nearly two decades. Nearly two decades after its discovery, the Ru(II)-catalysed C–H arylation of N-chelating aromatics with aryl halides was reinvestigated and a new key reaction intermediate was uncovered. A thorough mechanistic elucidation has now led to the development of a new class of catalysts with unique efficacy towards late-stage arylation of ‘real-world’ compounds.

A high-dimensional microfluidic approach for selection of aptamers with programmable binding affinities

Aptamers are being applied as affinity reagents in analytical applications owing to their high stability, compact size and amenability to chemical modification. Generating aptamers with different binding affinities is desirable, but systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), the standard for aptamer generation, is unable to quantitatively produce aptamers with desired binding affinities and requires multiple rounds of selection to eliminate false-positive hits. Here we introduce Pro-SELEX, an approach for the rapid discovery of aptamers with precisely defined binding affinities that combines efficient particle display, high-performance microfluidic sorting and high-content bioinformatics. Using the Pro-SELEX workflow, we were able to investigate the binding performance of individual aptamer candidates under different selective pressures in a single round of selection. Using human myeloperoxidase as a target, we demonstrate that aptamers with dissociation constants spanning a 20-fold range of affinities can be identified within one round of Pro-SELEX. Generating aptamers for use as affinity reagents in analytical applications is important, but SELEX, the standard method for aptamer generation, is unable to select for pre-defined binding affinities. Now, by combining efficient particle display, high-performance microfluidic sorting and high-content bioinformatics, the method ‘Pro-SELEX’ can afford the quantitative generation of aptamers with programmable binding affinities.

Versatile protein recognition by the encoded display of multiple chemical elements on a constant macrocyclic scaffold

In nature, specific antibodies can be generated as a result of an adaptive selection and expansion of lymphocytes with suitable protein binding properties. We attempted to mimic antibody–antigen recognition by displaying multiple chemical diversity elements on a defined macrocyclic scaffold. Encoding of the displayed combinations was achieved using distinctive DNA tags, resulting in a library size of 35,393,112. Specific binders could be isolated against a variety of proteins, including carbonic anhydrase IX, horseradish peroxidase, tankyrase 1, human serum albumin, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, calmodulin, prostate-specific antigen and tumour necrosis factor. Similar to antibodies, the encoded display of multiple chemical elements on a constant scaffold enabled practical applications, such as fluorescence microscopy procedures or the selective in vivo delivery of payloads to tumours. Furthermore, the versatile structure of the scaffold facilitated the generation of protein-specific chemical probes, as illustrated by photo-crosslinking. Encoded display of multiple chemical elements on a constant macrocyclic scaffold could mimick antibody–antigen recognition. A chemical library constructed using this approach enabled the identification of specific binders against a variety of protein targets, including difficult targets, such as TNF.

Dimeric and trimeric catenation of giant chiral [8 + 12] imine cubes driven by weak supramolecular interactions

Mechanically interlocked structures, such as catenanes and rotaxanes, are fascinating synthetic targets and some are used for molecular switches and machines. Today, the vast majority of catenated structures are built upon macrocycles and only a very few examples of three-dimensional shape-persistent organic cages forming such structures have been reported. However, the catenation in all these cases was based on a thermodynamically favoured π–π-stacking under certain reaction conditions. Here, we show that catenane formation can be induced by adding methoxy or thiomethyl groups to one of the precursors during the synthesis of chiral [8 + 12] imine cubes, giving dimeric and trimeric catenated organic cages. To elucidate the underlying driving forces, we reacted 11 differently 1,4-disubstituted terephthaldehydes with a chiral triamino tribenzotriquinacene under various conditions to study whether monomeric cages or catenated cage dimers are the preferred products. We find that catenation is mainly directed by weak interactions derived from the substituents rather than by π-stacking. Interlocked shape-persistent organic cages are rare structures and the majority are formed using π-stacking as the driving force. Now it is shown that weak dispersion interactions—which are modulated by changing the 1,4-substituents of the constituent dialdehyde linkers—can be used to form interlocked dimeric and trimeric catenated cages.

Rapid functionalization of multiple C–H bonds in unprotected alicyclic amines

The synthesis of valuable bioactive alicyclic amines containing variable substituents in multiple ring positions typically relies on multistep synthetic sequences that frequently require the introduction and subsequent removal of undesirable protecting groups. Although a vast number of studies have aimed to simplify access to such materials through the C–H bond functionalization of feedstock alicyclic amines, the simultaneous introduction of more than one substituent to unprotected amines has never been accomplished. Here we report an advance in C–H bond functionalization methodology that enables the introduction of up to three substituents in a single operation. Lithiated amines are first exposed to a ketone oxidant, generating transient imines that are subsequently converted to endocyclic 1-azaallyl anions, which can be processed further to furnish β-substituted, α,β-disubstituted, or α,β,α′-trisubstituted amines. This study highlights the unique utility of in situ-generated endocyclic 1-azaallyl anions, elusive intermediates in synthetic chemistry. The preparation of unprotected alicyclic amines containing variable substituents in multiple ring positions typically requires multistep synthetic sequences. Now, an advance in C–H bond functionalization methodology that enables the convenient preparation of elusive endocyclic 1-azaallyl anions allows the introduction of up to three substituents in a single operation.

A columnar liquid quasicrystal with a honeycomb structure that consists of triangular, square and trapezoidal cells

Quasicrystals are intriguing structures that have long-range positional correlations but no periodicity in real space, and typically with rotational symmetries that are ‘forbidden’ in conventional periodic crystals. Here, we present a two-dimensional columnar liquid quasicrystal with dodecagonal symmetry. Unlike previous dodecagonal quasicrystals based on random tiling, a honeycomb structure based on a strictly quasiperiodic tessellation of tiles is observed. The structure consists of dodecagonal clusters made up of triangular, square and trapezoidal cells that are optimal for local packing. To maximize the presence of such dodecagonal clusters, the system abandons periodicity but adopts a quasiperiodic structure that follows strict packing rules. The stability of random-tiling dodecagonal quasicrystals is often attributed to the entropy of disordering when strict tiling rules are broken, at the sacrifice of the long-range positional order. However, our results demonstrate that quasicrystal stability may rest on energy minimization alone, or with only minimal entropic intervention. Quasicrystals are intriguing structures that exhibit long-range positional correlations but no periodicity in real space. Now, T-shaped amphiphilic molecules featuring rigid cores have been found to self-assemble into a columnar liquid quasicrystal with dodecagonal symmetry. The honeycomb structure observed arises from a strictly quasiperiodic tessellation of square, triangular and trapezoidal tiles, rather than from random tiling.

Wittig reagents for chemoselective sulfenic acid ligation enables global site stoichiometry analysis and redox-controlled mitochondrial targeting

Triphenylphosphonium ylides, known as Wittig reagents, are one of the most commonly used tools in synthetic chemistry. Despite their considerable versatility, Wittig reagents have not yet been explored for their utility in biological applications. Here we introduce a chemoselective ligation reaction that harnesses the reactivity of Wittig reagents and the unique chemical properties of sulfenic acid, a pivotal post-translational cysteine modification in redox biology. The reaction, which generates a covalent bond between the ylide nucleophilic α-carbon and electrophilic γ-sulfur, is highly selective, rapid and affords robust labelling under a range of biocompatible reaction conditions, which includes in living cells. We highlight the broad utility of this conjugation method to enable site-specific proteome-wide stoichiometry analysis of S-sulfenylation and to visualize redox-dependent changes in mitochondrial cysteine oxidation and redox-triggered triphenylphosphonium generation for the controlled delivery of small molecules to mitochondria. Triphenylphosphonium ylides (Wittig reagents) that selectively react with sulfenic acids—a pivotal post-translational cysteine modification in redox biology—are developed. This bioconjugation method enables a site-specific proteome-wide stoichiometry analysis of S-sulfenylation, and visualization of redox-dependent changes in mitochondrial cysteine oxidation and the redox-triggered generation of triphenylphosphonium for the controlled delivery of small molecules to mitochondria.

Concise, scalable and enantioselective total synthesis of prostaglandins

Prostaglandins are among the most important natural isolates owing to their broad range of bioactivities and unique structures. However, current methods for the synthesis of prostaglandins suffer from low yields and lengthy steps. Here, we report a practicability-oriented synthetic strategy for the enantioselective and divergent synthesis of prostaglandins. In this approach, the multiply substituted five-membered rings in prostaglandins were constructed via the key enyne cycloisomerization with excellent selectivity (&gt;20:1 d.r., 98% e.e.). The crucial chiral centre on the scaffold of the prostaglandins was installed using the asymmetric hydrogenation method (up to 98% yield and 98% e.e.). From our versatile common intermediates, a series of prostaglandins and related drugs could be produced in two steps, and fluprostenol could be prepared on a 20-gram scale. Current methods for the synthesis of prostaglandins suffer from low yields and lengthy steps. Now, a strategy for their enantioselective synthesis has been developed with rhodium-catalysed enyne cycloisomerization as the key step. This concise route was scaled up, enabling the preparation of fluprostenol on a 20-gram scale.

Plasmonic visible–near infrared photothermal activation of olefin metathesis enabling photoresponsive materials

Light-induced catalysis and thermoplasmonics are promising fields creating many opportunities for innovative research. Recent advances in light-induced olefin metathesis have led to new applications in polymer and material science, but further improvements to reaction scope and efficiency are desired. Herein, we present the activation of latent ruthenium-based olefin metathesis catalysts via the photothermal response of plasmonic gold nanobipyramids. Simple synthetic control over gold nanobipyramid size results in tunable localized surface plasmon resonance bands enabling catalyst initiation with low-energy visible and infrared light. This approach was applied to the ROMP of dicyclopentadiene, affording plasmonic polymer composites with exceptional photoresponsive and mechanical properties. Moreover, this method of catalyst activation was proven to be remarkably more efficient than activation through conventional heating in all the metathesis processes tested. This study paves the way for providing a wide range of photoinduced olefin metathesis processes in particular and photoinduced latent organic reactions in general by direct photothermal activation of thermally latent catalysts. Current strategies for photoinduced olefin metathesis lack wavelength tunability. Now, plasmonic nanoparticles have been used to activate latent ruthenium catalysts, enabling light-induced olefin metathesis in the infrared range with several advantages when compared with conventional heating. Implementing this approach in ring-opening metathesis polymerization resulted in photoresponsive polymer–nanoparticle composites with enhanced mechanical properties.

Isolation of a triplet benzene dianion

Baird’s rule predicts that molecules with 4n π electrons should be aromatic in the triplet state, but the realization of simple ring systems with such an electronic ground state has been stymied by these molecules’ tendency to distort into structures bearing a large singlet–triplet gap. Here, we show that the elusive benzene diradical dianion can be stabilized through creation of a binucleating ligand that enforces a tightly constrained inverse sandwich structure and direct magnetic exchange coupling. Specifically, we report the compounds [K(18-crown-6)(THF)2]2[M2(BzN6-Mes)] (M = Y, Gd; BzN6-Mes = 1,3,5-tris[2′,6′-(N-mesityl)dimethanamino-4′-tert-butylphenyl]benzene), which feature a trigonal ligand that binds one trivalent metal ion on each face of a central benzene dianion. Antiferromagnetic exchange in the Gd3+ compound preferentially stabilizes the triplet state such that it becomes the molecular ground state. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations support aromaticity, in agreement with Baird’s rule. Molecules with 4n π electrons should display Baird aromaticity in the triplet state, but isolation of ring systems with this electronic ground state is stymied by structural distortion. Now, a benzene diradical dianion has been stabilized by being held rigid in a binucleating ligand as well as through magnetic exchange; single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and NICS calculations support its ground-state Baird aromaticity.

Tailored self-assembled photocatalytic nanofibres for visible-light-driven hydrogen production

The creation of efficient artificial systems that mimic natural photosynthesis represents a key current challenge. Here, we describe a high-performance recyclable photocatalytic core–shell nanofibre system that integrates a cobalt catalyst and a photosensitizer in close proximity for hydrogen production from water using visible light. The composition, microstructure and dimensions—and thereby the catalytic activity—of the nanofibres were controlled through living crystallization-driven self-assembly. In this seeded growth strategy, block copolymers with crystallizable core-forming blocks and functional coronal segments were coassembled into low-dispersity, one-dimensional architectures. Under optimized conditions, the nanofibres promote the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water with an overall quantum yield for solar energy conversion to hydrogen gas of ~4.0% (with a turnover number of &gt;7,000 over 5 h, a frequency of &gt;1,400 h−1 and a H2 production rate of &gt;0.327 μmol h−1 with 1.34 μg of catalytic polymer (that is, &gt;244,300 μmol h−1 g−1 of catalytic polymer)). Artificial systems capable of photocatalytic hydrogen production are not typically based on precisely controlled scaffolds. Now, statistical seeded crystallization of block copolymers—bearing either a pendant cobalt catalyst or a photosensitizer—from solution has been shown to yield recyclable, colloidally stable nanofibres that can be tailored to promote photocatalytic hydrogen production from water.

Building in vitro transcriptional regulatory networks by successively integrating multiple functional circuit modules

The regulation of cellular dynamics and responses to stimuli by genetic regulatory networks suggests how in vitro chemical reaction networks might analogously direct the dynamics of synthetic materials or chemistries. A key step in developing genetic regulatory network analogues capable of this type of sophisticated regulation is the integration of multiple coordinated functions within a single network. Here, we demonstrate how such functional integration can be achieved using in vitro transcriptional genelet circuits that emulate essential features of cellular genetic regulatory networks. By successively incorporating functional genelet modules into a bistable circuit, we construct an integrated regulatory network that dynamically changes its state in response to upstream stimuli and coordinates the timing of downstream signal expression. We use quantitative models to guide module integration and develop strategies to mitigate undesired interactions between network components that arise as the size of the network increases. This approach could enable the construction of in vitro networks capable of multifaceted chemical and material regulation. The regulation of cellular response to stimuli by genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) suggests how in vitro chemical reaction networks might be used to direct the dynamics of synthetic materials or chemical reactions. Now, multiple functional in vitro transcriptional circuit modules have been integrated to form composite regulatory networks capable of complex features analogous to those found in cellular GRNs.

Single-particle combinatorial multiplexed liposome fusion mediated by DNA

Combinatorial high-throughput methodologies are central for both screening and discovery in synthetic biochemistry and biomedical sciences. They are, however, often reliant on large-scale analyses and thus limited by a long running time and excessive materials cost. We here present a single-particle combinatorial multiplexed liposome fusion mediated by DNA for parallelized multistep and non-deterministic fusion of individual subattolitre nanocontainers. We observed directly the efficient (&gt;93%) and leakage free stochastic fusion sequences for arrays of surface-tethered target liposomes with six freely diffusing populations of cargo liposomes, each functionalized with individual lipidated single-stranded DNA and fluorescently barcoded by a distinct ratio of chromophores. The stochastic fusion resulted in a distinct permutation of fusion sequences for each autonomous nanocontainer. Real-time total internal reflection imaging allowed the direct observation of &gt;16,000 fusions and 566 distinct fusion sequences accurately classified using machine learning. The high-density arrays of surface-tethered target nanocontainers (~42,000 containers per mm2) offers entire combinatorial multiplex screens using only picograms of material. Combinatorial high-throughput methodologies can accelerate screening and discovery in biochemistry and biomedical sciences, but they often rely on large-scale analyses, making them time-consuming and expensive. Now, DNA-mediated fusion of single liposomes has been shown to enable the spatially resolved and parallel cargo delivery of subattolitre volumes in a stochastic order of succession.

Nanopore microscope identifies RNA isoforms with structural colours

Identifying RNA transcript isoforms requires intricate protocols that suffer from various enzymatic biases. Here we design three-dimensional molecular constructs that enable identification of transcript isoforms at the single-molecule level using solid-state nanopore microscopy. We refold target RNA into RNA identifiers with designed sets of complementary DNA strands. Each reshaped molecule carries a unique sequence of structural (pseudo)colours. Structural colours consist of DNA structures, protein labels, native RNA structures or a combination of all three. The sequence of structural colours of RNA identifiers enables simultaneous identification and relative quantification of multiple RNA targets without prior amplification. Our Amplification-free RNA TargEt Multiplex Isoform Sensing (ARTEMIS) method reveals structural arrangements in native transcripts in agreement with published variants. ARTEMIS discriminates circular and linear transcript isoforms in a one-step, enzyme-free reaction in a complex human transcriptome using single-molecule read-out. A method has been developed to identify RNA transcript isoforms at the single-molecule level using solid-state nanopore microscopy. In this method, target RNA is refolded into RNA identifiers with designed sets of complementary DNA strands. Each reshaped molecule carries a unique sequence of structural (pseudo)colours that enables identification and quantification using solid-state nanopore microscopy.

Time-resolved terahertz–Raman spectroscopy reveals that cations and anions distinctly modify intermolecular interactions of water

The solvation of ions changes the physical, chemical and thermodynamic properties of water, and the microscopic origin of this behaviour is believed to be ion-induced perturbation of water’s hydrogen-bonding network. Here we provide microscopic insights into this process by monitoring the dissipation of energy in salt solutions using time-resolved terahertz–Raman spectroscopy. We resonantly drive the low-frequency rotational dynamics of water molecules using intense terahertz pulses and probe the Raman response of their intermolecular translational motions. We find that the intermolecular rotational-to-translational energy transfer is enhanced by highly charged cations and is drastically reduced by highly charged anions, scaling with the ion surface charge density and ion concentration. Our molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the water–water hydrogen-bond strength between the first and second solvation shells of cations increases, while it decreases around anions. The opposite effects of cations and anions on the intermolecular interactions of water resemble the effects of ions on the stabilization and denaturation of proteins. Ions in salt solutions perturb the hydrogen bonding between the surrounding water molecules, altering the properties of water, but how ion polarity affects this is not fully understood. By monitoring the dissipation of terahertz energy in salt solutions, it has now been shown that intermolecular rotational-to-translational energy transfer is enhanced by highly charged cations and reduced by highly charged anions.

Title: 
A site-selective amination catalyst discriminates between nearly identical C–H bonds of unsymmetrical disubstituted alkenes

C–H activation reactions enable chemists to unveil new retrosynthetic disconnections and streamline conventional synthetic approaches. A long-standing challenge in C–H activation is the inability to distinguish electronically and sterically similar C–H bonds. Although numerous synergistic combinations of transition-metal complexes and chelating directing groups have been utilized to distinguish C–H bonds, undirected regioselective C–H functionalization strategies remain elusive. Here we report a regioselective C–H activation/amination reaction of various unsymmetrical dialkyl-substituted alkenes. The regioselectivity of C–H activation is correlated to the electronic properties of allylic C–H bonds indicated by the corresponding 1JCH coupling constants. A linear relationship between the difference in the 1JCH coupling constants of the two competing allylic C–H bonds (Δ1JCH) and the C–H activation barriers (ΔΔG‡) has also been determined. Site-selective functionalization of nearly identical C–H bonds has been a long-standing challenge. Now, a regioselective C–H amination has been achieved by [CpxIr(iii)] catalysis, which senses subtle electronic differences of allylic C–H bonds induced by remote electron-withdrawing groups. A linear correlation between Δ1JCH and ΔΔG‡ is found, leading to predictable regioselectivities.

Robust gold nanorods stabilized by bidentate N-heterocyclic-carbene–thiolate ligands

Although N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have demonstrated outstanding potential for use as surface anchors, synthetic challenges have limited their application to either large planar substrates or very small spherical nanoparticles. The development of a strategy to graft NHCs onto non-spherical nanomaterials, such as gold nanorods, would greatly expand their utility as surface ligands. Here, we use a bidentate thiolate–NHC–gold(i) complex that is easily grafted onto commercial cetyl trimethylammonium bromide-stabilized gold nanorods through ligand exchange. On mild reduction of the resulting surface-tethered NHC–gold(i) complexes, the gold atom attached to the NHC complex is added to the surface as an adatom, thereby precluding the need for reorganization of the underlying surface lattice upon NHC binding. The resulting thiolate–NHC-stabilized gold nanorods are stable towards excess glutathione for up to six days, and under conditions with large variations in pH, high and low temperatures, high salt concentrations, or in biological media and cell culture. We also demonstrate the utility of these nanorods for in vitro photothermal therapy. N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are valuable surface anchors, but their use has remained limited to either spherical or planar nanomaterials. Now, they have been grafted onto gold nanorods through a bidentate ligand featuring a thiolate and a NHC–gold complex. The resulting nanorods are robust towards a wide range of harsh conditions and show promise for photothermal therapy.

A molecular multi-gene classifier for disease diagnostics

Despite its early promise as a diagnostic and prognostic tool, gene expression profiling remains cost-prohibitive and challenging to implement in a clinical setting. Here, we introduce a molecular computation strategy for analysing the information contained in complex gene expression signatures without the need for costly instrumentation. Our workflow begins by training a computational classifier on labelled gene expression data. This in silico classifier is then realized at the molecular level to enable expression analysis and classification of previously uncharacterized samples. Classification occurs through a series of molecular interactions between RNA inputs and engineered DNA probes designed to differentially weigh each input according to its importance. We validate our technology with two applications: a classifier for early cancer diagnostics and a classifier for differentiating viral and bacterial respiratory infections based on host gene expression. Together, our results demonstrate a general and modular framework for low-cost gene expression analysis. Gene expression profiling remains cost-prohibitive and challenging to implement in a clinical setting. Now, a molecular computation strategy for classifying complex gene expression signatures has been developed. Classification occurs through a series of molecular interactions between RNA inputs and engineered DNA probes designed to implement a relevant linear classification model.

Photochemical single-step synthesis of β-amino acid derivatives from alkenes and (hetero)arenes

β-Amino acids are frequently found as important components in numerous biologically active molecules, drugs and natural products. In particular, they are broadly utilized in the construction of bioactive peptides and peptidomimetics, thanks to their increased metabolic stability. Despite the number of methodologies established for the preparation of β-amino acid derivatives, the majority of these methods require metal-mediated multistep manipulations of prefunctionalized substrates. Here we disclose a metal-free, energy-transfer enabled highly regioselective intermolecular aminocarboxylation reaction for the single-step installation of both amine and ester functionalities into alkenes or (hetero)arenes. A bifunctional oxime oxalate ester was developed to simultaneously generate C-centred ester and N-centred iminyl radicals. This mild method features a remarkably broad substrate scope (up to 140 examples) and excellent tolerance of sensitive functional groups, and substrates that range from the simplest ethylene to complex (hetero)arenes can participate in the reaction, thus offering a general and practical access to β-amino acid derivatives. The majority of methods to prepare β-amino acid derivatives require metal-mediated multistep manipulations of pre-functionalized substrates. Now, a metal-free, energy-transfer enabled, highly regioselective aminocarboxylation reaction has been developed, for the single-step installation of both amine and ester functionalities into alkenes or (hetero)arenes. An oxime oxalate ester is used as a bifunctional reagent, supplying C-centred ester and N-centred iminyl radicals.

Formation of the layered conductive magnet CrCl2(pyrazine)2 through redox-active coordination chemistry

The unique properties of graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides and other two-dimensional (2D) materials have boosted interest in layered coordination solids. In particular, 2D materials that behave as both conductors and magnets could find applications in quantum magnetoelectronics and spintronics. Here, we report the synthesis of CrCl2(pyrazine)2, an air-stable layered solid, by reaction of CrCl2 with pyrazine (pyz). This compound displays a ferrimagnetic order below ∼55 K, reflecting the presence of strong magnetic interactions. Electrical conductivity measurements demonstrate that CrCl2(pyz)2 reaches a conductivity of 32 mS cm–1 at room temperature, which operates through a 2D hopping-based transport mechanism. These properties are induced by the redox-activity of the pyrazine ligand, which leads to a smearing of the Cr 3d and pyrazine π states. We suggest that the combination of redox-active ligands and reducing paramagnetic metal ions represents a general approach towards tuneable 2D materials that consist of charge-neutral layers and exhibit both long-range magnetic order and high electronic conductivity. Layered coordination polymers are attractive for the preparation of advanced 2D materials but they are typically non-magnetic insulators. Now such a layered network, CrCl2(pyrazine)2, has been prepared that comprises a paramagnetic metal ion and a redox-active ligand. The material exhibits both magnetism — with a ferrimagnetic ground state — and high electrical conductivity.

Few-layer graphdiyne doped with sp-hybridized nitrogen atoms at acetylenic sites for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a fundamental reaction for energy storage and conversion. It has mainly relied on platinum-based electrocatalysts, but the chemical doping of carbon-based materials has proven to be a promising strategy for preparing metal-free alternatives. Nitrogen doping in particular provides a diverse range of nitrogen forms. Here, we introduce a new form of nitrogen doping moieties —sp-hybridized nitrogen (sp-N) atoms into chemically defined sites of ultrathin graphdiyne, through pericyclic replacement of the acetylene groups. The as-prepared sp-N-doped graphdiyne catalyst exhibits overall good ORR performance, in particular with regards to peak potential, half-wave potential and current density. Under alkaline conditions it was comparable to commercial Pt/C, and showed more rapid kinetics. And although its performances are a bit lower than those of Pt/C in acidic media they surpass those of other metal-free materials. Taken together, experimental data and density functional theory calculations suggest that the high catalytic activity originates from the sp-N dopant, which facilitates O2 adsorption and electron transfer on the surface of the catalyst. This incorporation of chemically defined sp-N atoms provides a new synthetic route to high-performance carbon-based and other metal-free catalysts. Heteroatom doping is a widely used modification method for carbon-based catalysts. Now, chemically defined sp-hybridized nitrogen atoms have been selectively introduced to the acetylene groups in ultrathin graphdiynes, resulting in good catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic media.

Catalytic transport of molecular cargo using diffusive binding along a polymer track

Transport at the molecular scale is a prerequisite for the development of future molecular factories. Here, we have designed oligoanionic molecular sliders on polycationic tracks that exploit Brownian motion and diffusive binding to transport cargo without using a chemical fuel. The presence of the polymer tracks increases the rate of bimolecular reactions between modified sliders by over two orders of magnitude. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the sliders not only diffuse, but also jump and hop surprisingly efficiently along polymer tracks. Inspired by acetyl-coenzyme A transporting and delivering acetyl groups in many essential biochemical processes, we developed a new and unconventional type of catalytic transport involving sliders (including coenzyme A) picking up, transporting and selectively delivering molecular cargo. Furthermore, we show that the concept of diffusive binding can also be utilized for the spatially controlled transport of chemical groups across gels. This work represents a new concept for designing functional nanosystems based on random Brownian motion. One-dimensional diffusive binding represents an important mechanism used by nature to facilitate many fundamental biochemical processes. Now, a completely synthetic system with similar capabilities has been constructed. The system was exploited to significantly speed up bimolecular reactions and to catalytically transport molecular cargo in solution and within physically separated compartments.

Self-assembly of polyoxometalate clusters into two-dimensional clusterphene structures featuring hexagonal pores

Two-dimensional (2D) structures have been shown to possess interesting and potentially useful properties. Because of their isotropic structure, however, clusters tend to assemble into 3D architectures. Here we report the assembly of polyoxometalate clusters into layered structures that feature uniform hexagonal pores and in-plane electron delocalization properties. Because these structures are 2D and visually reminiscent of graphene, they are referred to as ‘clusterphenes’. A series of multilayer and monolayer clusterphenes have been constructed with 13 types of polyoxometalate cluster. The resulting clusterphenes were shown to exhibit substantially improved stability and catalytic efficiency towards olefin epoxidation reactions, with a turnover frequency of 4.16 h−1, which is 76.5 times that of the unassembled clusters. The catalytic activity of the clusterphenes derives from the electron delocalization between identical clusters within the 2D layer, which efficiently reduces the activation energy of the catalytic reaction. Polyoxometalate clusters have been assembled into two-dimensional ‘clusterphene’ layers that are held together by coordination to lanthanide ions and electrostatic interactions with quaternary ammonium cations. The resulting materials resemble graphene sheets on account of their uniform hexagonal pores and are shown to catalyse epoxidation reactions due to their in-plane electron delocalization.

A biosynthetic pathway to aromatic amines that uses glycyl-tRNA as nitrogen donor

Aromatic amines in nature are typically installed with Glu or Gln as the nitrogen donor. Here we report a pathway that features glycyl-tRNA instead. During the biosynthesis of pyrroloiminoquinone-type natural products such as ammosamides, peptide-aminoacyl tRNA ligases append amino acids to the C-terminus of a ribosomally synthesized peptide. First, $${\mathrm{Amm}}{{{\mathrm{B}}}}_{{{\mathrm{C}}}}^{{{{\mathrm{Trp}}}}}$$ adds Trp in a Trp-tRNA-dependent reaction and the flavoprotein AmmC1 then carries out three hydroxylations of the indole ring of Trp. After oxidation to the corresponding ortho-hydroxy para-quinone, $${\mathrm{Amm}}{{{\mathrm{B}}}}_{{{\mathrm{D}}}}^{{{{\mathrm{Gly}}}}}$$ attaches Gly to the indole ring in a Gly-tRNA dependent fashion. Subsequent decarboxylation and hydrolysis results in an amino-substituted indole. Similar transformations are catalysed by orthologous enzymes from Bacillus halodurans. This pathway features three previously unknown biochemical processes using a ribosomally synthesized peptide as scaffold for non-ribosomal peptide extension and chemical modification to generate an amino acid-derived natural product. Biosynthesis of aromatic amines typically uses glutamic acid or glutamine as the nitrogen donor. Now, a biosynthetic pathway to aromatic amines has been reported that uses glycyl-tRNA as the nitrogen donor. The myosin-targeting ammosamide is made via a pathway that involves the post-translational modification of a tryptophan, which is added to the end of a peptide in a tryptophanyl-tRNA-dependent step.

Deaminative chlorination of aminoheterocycles

Selective modification of heteroatom-containing aromatic structures is in high demand as it permits rapid evaluation of molecular complexity in advanced intermediates. Inspired by the selectivity of deaminases in nature, herein we present a simple methodology that enables the NH2 groups in aminoheterocycles to be conceived as masked modification handles. With the aid of a simple pyrylium reagent and a cheap chloride source, C(sp2)‒NH2 can be converted into C(sp2)‒Cl bonds. The method is characterized by its wide functional group tolerance and substrate scope, allowing the modification of &gt;20 different classes of heteroaromatic motifs (five- and six-membered heterocycles), bearing numerous sensitive motifs. The facile conversion of NH2 into Cl in a late-stage fashion enables practitioners to apply Sandmeyer- and Vilsmeier-type transforms without the burden of explosive and unsafe diazonium salts, stoichiometric transition metals or highly oxidizing and unselective chlorinating agents. Strategies for the selective modification of heteroatom-containing aromatic compounds are in high demand. Using a simple pyrylium reagent and a cheap chloride source, a method has now been developed that can selectively replace NH2 groups attached to heteroaromatic rings with a chlorine atom to give heteroaryl chlorides.

Expanding the antibacterial selectivity of polyether ionophore antibiotics through diversity-focused semisynthesis

Polyether ionophores are complex natural products capable of transporting cations across biological membranes. Many polyether ionophores possess potent antimicrobial activity and a few selected compounds have the ability to target aggressive cancer cells. Nevertheless, ionophore function is believed to be associated with idiosyncratic cellular toxicity and, consequently, human clinical development has not been pursued. Here, we demonstrate that structurally novel polyether ionophores can be efficiently constructed by recycling components of highly abundant polyethers to afford analogues with enhanced antibacterial selectivity compared to a panel of natural polyether ionophores. We used classic degradation reactions of the natural polyethers lasalocid and monensin and combined the resulting fragments with building blocks provided by total synthesis, including halogen-functionalized tetronic acids as cation-binding groups. Our results suggest that structural optimization of polyether ionophores is possible and that this area represents a potential opportunity for future methodological innovation. Polyether ionophores are natural products that display antibacterial activity—but they also show activity against mammalian cells, which has limited their development as clinical antibiotics. Now, a semisynthesis principle of recycling substructures from highly abundant natural polyether ionophores has been used to prepare analogues with enhanced selectivity towards bacterial cells.

Theory-driven design of high-valence metal sites for water oxidation confirmed using in situ soft X-ray absorption

The efficiency with which renewable fuels and feedstocks are synthesized from electrical sources is limited at present by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in pH-neutral media. We took the view that generating transition-metal sites with high valence at low applied bias should improve the activity of neutral OER catalysts. Here, using density functional theory, we find that the formation energy of desired Ni4+ sites is systematically modulated by incorporating judicious combinations of Co, Fe and non-metal P. We therefore synthesized NiCoFeP oxyhydroxides and probed their oxidation kinetics with in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS). In situ sXAS studies of neutral-pH OER catalysts indicate ready promotion of Ni4+ under low overpotential conditions. The NiCoFeP catalyst outperforms IrO2 and retains its performance following 100 h of operation. We showcase NiCoFeP in a membrane-free CO2 electroreduction system that achieves a 1.99 V cell voltage at 10 mA cm–2, reducing CO2 into CO and oxidizing H2O to O2 with a 64% electricity-to-chemical-fuel efficiency. Water oxidation is key to the production of chemical fuels from electricity. Now, guided by theory, NiCoFeP oxyhydroxide catalysts have been developed that require an overpotential lower than that required by IrO2. In situ soft X-ray absorption studies of neutral-pH NiCoFeP catalysts indicate formation of Ni4+, which is favourable for water oxidation.

Biosynthesis-guided discovery reveals enteropeptins as alternative sactipeptides containing N-methylornithine

The combination of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics has revitalized natural product discovery. Using a bioinformatic search strategy, we recently identified ∼600 gene clusters in otherwise overlooked streptococci that code for ribosomal peptide natural products synthesized by radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes. These grouped into 16 subfamilies and pointed to an unexplored microbiome biosynthetic landscape. Here we report the structure, biosynthesis and function of one of these natural product groups, which we term enteropeptins, from the gut microbe Enterococcus cecorum. We show three reactions in the biosynthesis of enteropeptins that are each catalysed by a different family of metalloenzymes. Among these, we characterize the founding member of a widespread superfamily of Fe–S-containing methyltransferases, which, together with an Mn2+-dependent arginase, installs N-methylornithine in the peptide sequence. Biological assays with the mature product revealed bacteriostatic activity only against the producing strain, extending an emerging theme of fratricidal or self-inhibitory metabolites in microbiome firmicutes. Enteropeptins are peptide natural products produced by the gut microbe Enterococcus cecorum. Now, the structure, biosynthesis and function of enteropeptins have been determined. After ribosomal biosynthesis, enteropeptins are post-translationally modified in three reactions carried out by a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme, an Mn2+-dependent arginase, and an Fe–S-containing methyltransferase, respectively, to form the N-methylornithine-containing peptide natural products.

Optimization of the facet structure of transition-metal catalysts applied to the oxygen reduction reaction

Predicting the optimal structure for a catalytic material has been a long-standing goal, but typically an arbitrary active site on a uniform surface is modelled. Identification of the most-active facet structure for structure-sensitive chemistries, such as the oxygen reduction reaction, is lacking. Here we develop an approach to predict the optimal structure of a catalytic material by identifying the active site and identifying the density and spatial arrangement of such sites while minimizing the surface energy. We find that the theoretical peak performance predicted by linear scaling relations is unattainable because of the lack of suitable active sites on low-index planes, as well as geometric and stability constraints. A random array of vacancies results in a modest performance enhancement compared to ideal facets, whereas defect sites with a maximum density in disordered structures significantly increase the catalyst performance. We applied this methodology to the oxygen reduction reaction on defected Pt(111), Pt(100), Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces. While much effort has been devoted to understanding how nanoparticle morphology can be leveraged to improve catalytic activity, engineering their microstructure from first principles to this end has remained difficult. Now a methodology for designing the optimal structure of a solid catalyst with the aim of achieving the highest possible activity for surface-sensitive reactions has been developed.

Electronic landscape of the P-cluster of nitrogenase as revealed through many-electron quantum wavefunction simulations

The electronic structure of the nitrogenase metal cofactors is central to nitrogen fixation. However, the P-cluster and FeMo cofactor, each containing eight Fe atoms, have eluded detailed characterization of their electronic properties. We report on the low-energy electronic states of the P-cluster in three oxidation states through exhaustive many-electron wavefunction simulations enabled by new theoretical methods. The energy scales of orbital and spin excitations overlap, yielding a dense spectrum with features that we trace to the underlying atomic states and recouplings. The clusters exist in superpositions of spin configurations with non-classical spin correlations, complicating interpretation of magnetic spectroscopies, whereas the charges are mostly localized from reorganization of the cluster and its surroundings. On oxidation, the opening of the P-cluster substantially increases the density of states, which is intriguing given its proposed role in electron transfer. These results demonstrate that many-electron simulations stand to provide new insights into the electronic structure of the nitrogenase cofactors. The electronic structures of the metal cofactors of nitrogenase are key to biological nitrogen fixation; however, the [Fe8S7] P-cluster and FeMo cofactor have eluded detailed electronic characterization. Now, the electronic structure of the P-cluster of nitrogenase has been revealed at the many-electron level through exhaustive quantum wavefunction simulations.

Overcoming chemical equilibrium limitations using a thermodynamically reversible chemical reactor

All real processes, be they chemical, mechanical or electrical, are thermodynamically irreversible and therefore suffer from thermodynamic losses. Here, we report the design and operation of a chemical reactor capable of approaching thermodynamically reversible operation. The reactor was employed for hydrogen production via the water–gas shift reaction, an important route to ‘green’ hydrogen. The reactor avoids mixing reactant gases by transferring oxygen from the (oxidizing) water stream to the (reducing) carbon monoxide stream via a solid-state oxygen reservoir consisting of a perovskite phase (La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ). This reservoir is able to remain close to equilibrium with the reacting gas streams because of its variable degree of non-stoichiometry and thus develops a ‘chemical memory’ that we employ to approach reversibility. We demonstrate this memory using operando, spatially resolved, real-time, high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction on a working reactor. The design leads to a reactor unconstrained by overall chemical equilibrium limitations, which can produce essentially pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide as separate product streams. Conventional chemical reactors are subject to the equilibrium limitations imposed by the overall reaction. It has now been shown that this limitation can be overcome if reactants are fed separately to a reactor and a non-stoichiometric oxygen carrier is used to transfer both oxygen and key chemical information across a reaction cycle.

Capturing intrinsic site-dependent spectral signatures and lifetimes of isolated OH oscillators in extended water networks

The extremely broad infrared spectrum of water in the OH stretching region is a manifestation of how profoundly a water molecule is distorted when embedded in its extended hydrogen-bonding network. Many effects contribute to this breadth in solution at room temperature, which raises the question as to what the spectrum of a single OH oscillator would be in the absence of thermal fluctuations and coupling to nearby OH groups. We report the intrinsic spectral responses of isolated OH oscillators embedded in two cold (~20 K), hydrogen-bonded water cages adopted by the Cs+·(HDO)(D2O)19 and D3O+·(HDO)(D2O)19 clusters. Most OH oscillators yield single, isolated features that occur with linewidths that increase approximately linearly with their redshifts. Oscillators near 3,400 cm−1, however, occur with a second feature, which indicates that OH stretch excitation of these molecules drives low-frequency, phonon-type motions of the cage. The excited state lifetimes inferred from the broadening are considered in the context of fluctuations in the local electric fields that are available even at low temperature. The broad infrared spectrum of water in the OH stretching region shows how significantly a water molecule is distorted when within a hydrogen-bonding network; it also raises the question of what the spectrum of a single OH oscillator would be. Now, the spectral signatures of isolated OH oscillators embedded in cold water cages have been measured using vibrational spectroscopy.

Coordination cages as permanently porous ionic liquids

Porous materials are widely used in industry for applications that include chemical separations and gas scrubbing. These materials are typically porous solids, although the liquid state can be easier to manipulate in industrial settings. The idea of combining the size and shape selectivity of porous domains with the fluidity of liquids is a promising one and porous liquids composed of functionalized organic cages have recently attracted attention. Here we describe an ionic-liquid, porous, tetrahedral coordination cage. Complementing the gas binding observed in other porous liquids, this material also encapsulates non-gaseous guests—shape and size selectivity was observed for a series of isomeric alcohols. Three gaseous chlorofluorocarbon guests, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane and chlorotrifluoromethane, were also shown to be taken up by the liquid coordination cage with an affinity that increased with their size. We hope that these findings will lead to the synthesis of other porous liquids whose guest-uptake properties may be tailored to fulfil specific functions. Porous liquids promise to combine the advantages of the porosity of solids with those of the fluidity of liquids. Now, a permanently porous ionic-liquid coordination cage has been assembled that encapsulates isomers of butanol and propanol with some size and shape selectivity, as well as three gaseous chlorofluorocarbons with a size-dependent affinity.

Magnetic ordering through itinerant ferromagnetism in a metal–organic framework

Materials that combine magnetic order with other desirable physical attributes could find transformative applications in spintronics, quantum sensing, low-density magnets and gas separations. Among potential multifunctional magnetic materials, metal–organic frameworks, in particular, bear structures that offer intrinsic porosity, vast chemical and structural programmability, and the tunability of electronic properties. Nevertheless, magnetic order within metal–organic frameworks has generally been limited to low temperatures, owing largely to challenges in creating a strong magnetic exchange. Here we employ the phenomenon of itinerant ferromagnetism to realize magnetic ordering at TC = 225 K in a mixed-valence chromium(ii/iii) triazolate compound, which represents the highest ferromagnetic ordering temperature yet observed in a metal–organic framework. The itinerant ferromagnetism proceeds through a double-exchange mechanism, which results in a barrierless charge transport below the Curie temperature and a large negative magnetoresistance of 23% at 5 K. These observations suggest applications for double-exchange-based coordination solids in the emergent fields of magnetoelectrics and spintronics. The development of metal–organic magnets that combine tunable magnetic properties with other desirable physical properties remains challenging despite numerous potential applications. Now, a mixed-valent chromium–triazolate material has been prepared that exhibits itinerant ferromagnetism with a magnetic ordering temperature of 225 K, a high conductivity and large negative magnetoresistance (23%).

Title: 
Metathesis of Ge=Ge double bonds

The metathesis of carbon–carbon double bonds—the ‘reshuffling’ of their constituting carbene fragments—is a tremendously important preparative tool in industry and academia. Metathesis of heavier alkene homologues is restricted to occasional unproductive examples in phosphorus chemistry and cross-metathesis to mixed heavier alkynes. We now report the thermally induced, transition-metal-free metathesis of purpose-built unsymmetrically substituted digermenes. The A2Ge=GeAB starting materials are thus converted to symmetrically substituted derivatives of the A2Ge=GeA2 and ABGe=GeAB types. The use of tethered auxiliary donors (dimethylaniline groups) in substituents B ensures intramolecular donor–acceptor stabilization of the transient germylene fragments, the intermediacy of which is proven by trapping experiments. Density functional theory calculations shed light on the thermodynamic driving force of the metathesis and validate the crucial role of the tethered donor. With an analogously equipped bridged tetragermadiene precursor (A2Ge=GeB-X-BGe=GeA2), heavier acyclic diene metathesis polymerization occurs, in analogy to the widespread acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization in the carbon case, yielding a polydigermene. The metathesis of carbon–carbon double bonds is an important tool in organic synthesis and now a similar reshuffling has been carried out with heavier alkene analogues featuring unsymmetrically substituted Ge=Ge double bonds. This reaction enables the synthesis of symmetric molecular digermenes as well as a polymer based on Ge=Ge repeat units.

Catalytic enantioselective nucleophilic desymmetrization of phosphonate esters

Molecules that contain a stereogenic phosphorus atom are crucial to medicine, agrochemistry and catalysis. While methods are available for the selective construction of various chiral organophosphorus compounds, catalytic enantioselective approaches for their synthesis are far less common. Given the vastness of possible substituent combinations around a phosphorus atom, protocols for their preparation should also be divergent, providing facile access not only to one but to many classes of phosphorus compounds. Here we introduce a catalytic and enantioselective strategy for the preparation of an enantioenriched phosphorus(V) centre that can be diversified enantiospecifically to a wide range of biologically relevant phosphorus(V) compounds. The process, which involves an enantioselective nucleophilic substitution catalysed by a superbasic bifunctional iminophosphorane catalyst, can accommodate a wide range of carbon substituents at phosphorus. The resulting stable, yet versatile, synthetic intermediates can be combined with a multitude of medicinally relevant O-, N- and S-based nucleophiles. Catalytic enantioselective approaches to access chiral organophosphorus compounds are rare. A two-stage catalytic strategy for the synthesis of diverse enantioenriched P(V) compounds has now been developed: a bifunctional iminophosphorane superbase enables enantioselective nucleophilic desymmetrization, followed by downstream enantiospecific diversification of the resulting intermediate by substitution with medicinally relevant O-, N- and S-based nucleophiles.

Metal-free reduction of CO2 to formate using a photochemical organohydride-catalyst recycling strategy

Increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is a problem that must be urgently resolved if the rise in current global temperatures is to be slowed. Chemically reducing CO2 into compounds that are useful as energy sources and carbon-based materials could be helpful in this regard. However, for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to be operational on a global scale, the catalyst system must: use only renewable energy, be built from abundantly available elements and not require high-energy reactants. Although light is an attractive renewable energy source, most existing CO2RR methods use electricity and many of the catalysts used are based on rare heavy metals. Here we present a transition-metal-free catalyst system that uses an organohydride catalyst based on benzimidazoline for the CO2RR that can be regenerated using a carbazole photosensitizer and visible light. The system is capable of producing formate with a turnover number exceeding 8,000 and generates no other reduced products (such as H2 and CO). Photochemical reduction of CO2 is a significant challenge and many existing methods use catalysts containing rare metals. Now a metal-free version of this reaction—with high selectivity for formate generation over H2 or CO—has been achieved that features a combination of carbazole photosensitizer and organohydride catalyst.

Recyclable cyclic bio-based acrylic polymer via pairwise monomer enchainment by a trifunctional Lewis pair

The existing catalyst/initiator systems and methodologies used for the synthesis of polymers can access only a few cyclic polymers composed entirely of a single monomer type, and the synthesis of such authentic cyclic polar vinyl polymers (acrylics) devoid of any foreign motifs remains a challenge. Here we report that a tethered B-P-B trifunctional, intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair catalyst enables the synthesis of an authentic cyclic acrylic polymer, cyclic poly(γ-methyl-α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone) (c-PMMBL), from the bio-based monomer MMBL. Detailed studies have revealed an initiation and propagation mechanism through pairwise monomer enchainment enabled by the cooperative and synergistic initiator/catalyst sites of the trifunctional catalyst. We propose that macrocyclic intermediates and transition states comprising two catalyst molecules are involved in the catalyst-regulated ring expansion and eventual cyclization, forming authentic c-PMMBL rings and concurrently regenerating the catalyst. The cyclic topology of the c-PMMBL polymers imparts an ~50 °C higher onset decomposition temperature and a much narrower degradation window compared with their linear counterparts of similar molecular weight and dispersity, while maintaining high chemical recyclability. The synthesis of cyclic polymers remains challenging. Now a trifunctional B-P-B frustrated Lewis pair has been shown to enable easy access to cyclic acrylic polymers through a bimolecular mechanism. These cyclic polymers have enhanced thermodynamic properties compared with their linear counterparts, while maintaining high chemical recyclability.

Engineered modular biomaterial logic gates for environmentally triggered therapeutic delivery

The successful transport of drug- and cell-based therapeutics to diseased sites represents a major barrier in the development of clinical therapies. Targeted delivery can be mediated through degradable biomaterial vehicles that utilize disease biomarkers to trigger payload release. Here, we report a modular chemical framework for imparting hydrogels with precise degradative responsiveness by using multiple environmental cues to trigger reactions that operate user-programmable Boolean logic. By specifying the molecular architecture and connectivity of orthogonal stimuli-labile moieties within material cross-linkers, we show selective control over gel dissolution and therapeutic delivery. To illustrate the versatility of this methodology, we synthesized 17 distinct stimuli-responsive materials that collectively yielded all possible YES/OR/AND logic outputs from input combinations involving enzyme, reductant and light. Using these hydrogels we demonstrate the first sequential and environmentally stimulated release of multiple cell lines in well-defined combinations from a material. We expect these platforms will find utility in several diverse fields including drug delivery, diagnostics and regenerative medicine. Biomaterials that respond to precise combinations of environmental cues represent an important technology for tissue engineering and next-generation drug delivery systems. Now, a modular framework to programme material degradation following Boolean logic has been demonstrated by specifying the molecular architecture and connectivity of orthogonal stimuli-labile moieties within hydrogel cross-linkers.

Title: 
Stereoselective access to [5.5.0] and [4.4.1] bicyclic compounds through Pd-catalysed divergent higher-order cycloadditions

Medium-sized rings, including those embedded in bridged and fused bicyclic scaffolds, are common core structures of myriad bioactive molecules. Among various synthetic strategies towards their synthesis, intermolecular higher-order cycloaddition provides great potential to build complex medium-sized rings from simple building blocks. Unfortunately, such transformations are often plagued with competitive reaction pathways and low levels of site- and stereoselectivity. Herein, we report catalyst-controlled divergent access to three classes of medium-sized bicyclic compounds in high efficiency and stereoselectivity, by palladium-catalysed cycloadditions of tropones with γ-methylidene-δ-valerolactones. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations disclosed that the divergent reactions stem from the different reaction profiles of the diastereomeric intermediates. While one undergoes either O- or C-allylation to provide [5.5.0] or [4.4.1] bicyclic compounds, the unique conformation of the other diastereomer allows an unconventional alkene isomerization to deliver bridgehead alkene-containing bicyclo[4.4.1] compounds. The conversion of these products to diverse complex polycyclic scaffolds has also been demonstrated. Using readily accessible tropones and γ-methylidene-δ-valerolactones, the divergent synthesis of three classes of challenging [5.5.0] or [4.4.1] bicyclic systems has been achieved—with high efficiency and stereoselectivity—through Pd-catalysed higher-order cycloaddition. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations indicate that the divergent reactions arise from the different reactivity of two diastereomeric intermediates.

A human MUTYH variant linking colonic polyposis to redox degradation of the [4Fe4S]2+ cluster

The human DNA repair enzyme MUTYH excises mispaired adenine residues in oxidized DNA. Homozygous MUTYH mutations underlie the autosomal, recessive cancer syndrome MUTYH-associated polyposis. We report a MUTYH variant, p.C306W (c.918C&gt;G), with a tryptophan residue in place of native cysteine, that ligates the [4Fe4S] cluster in a patient with colonic polyposis and family history of early age colon cancer. In bacterial MutY, the [4Fe4S] cluster is redox active, allowing rapid localization to target lesions by long-range, DNA-mediated signalling. In the current study, using DNA electrochemistry, we determine that wild-type MUTYH is similarly redox-active, but MUTYH C306W undergoes rapid oxidative degradation of its cluster to [3Fe4S]+, with loss of redox signalling. In MUTYH C306W, oxidative cluster degradation leads to decreased DNA binding and enzyme function. This study confirms redox activity in eukaryotic DNA repair proteins and establishes MUTYH C306W as a pathogenic variant, highlighting the essential role of redox signalling by the [4Fe4S] cluster. The [4Fe4S]2+ cluster-containing DNA-repair enzyme MUTYH helps safeguard the integrity of Watson–Crick base pairing and the human genetic code. The MUTYH [4Fe4S]2+ cluster mediates DNA redox signalling and DNA lesion identification. Now, a MUTYH pathologic variant associated with catastrophic [4Fe4S]2+ cluster redox degradation, impairment of DNA signalling and human colonic tumorigenesis has been identified.

Title: 
Ribosomal synthesis and folding of peptide-helical aromatic foldamer hybrids

Translation, the mRNA-templated synthesis of peptides by the ribosome, can be manipulated to incorporate variants of the 20 cognate amino acids. Such approaches for expanding the range of chemical entities that can be produced by the ribosome may accelerate the discovery of molecules that can perform functions for which poorly folded, short peptidic sequences are ill suited. Here, we show that the ribosome tolerates some artificial helical aromatic oligomers, so-called foldamers. Using a flexible tRNA-acylation ribozyme—flexizyme—foldamers were attached to tRNA, and the resulting acylated tRNAs were delivered to the ribosome to initiate the synthesis of non-cyclic and cyclic foldamer–peptide hybrid molecules. Passing through the ribosome exit tunnel requires the foldamers to unfold. Yet foldamers encode sufficient folding information to influence the peptide structure once translation is completed. We also show that in cyclic hybrids, the foldamer portion can fold into a helix and force the peptide segment to adopt a constrained and stretched conformation. The extent to which peptide synthesis by the ribosome can tolerate the inclusion of non-peptidic components is not clear. Yet such hybrids would expand the range of ribosomally synthesized structures. Now it has been shown that tRNAs acylated by aromatic foldamers can initiate the ribosomal synthesis of non-cyclic and cyclic foldamer–peptide hybrid molecules. The oligo-aryl segments contain folding information that can control peptide conformation in the hybrids.

Mechanically axially chiral catenanes and noncanonical mechanically axially chiral rotaxanes

Chirality typically arises in molecules because of a rigidly chiral arrangement of covalently bonded atoms. Less generally appreciated is that chirality can arise when molecules are threaded through one another to create a mechanical bond. For example, when two macrocycles with chemically distinct faces are joined to form a catenane, the structure is chiral, although the rings themselves are not. However, enantiopure mechanically axially chiral catenanes in which the mechanical bond provides the sole source of stereochemistry have not been reported. Here we re-examine the symmetry properties of these molecules and in doing so identify a straightforward route to access them from simple chiral building blocks. Our analysis also led us to identify an analogous but previously unremarked upon rotaxane stereogenic unit, which also yielded to our co-conformational auxiliary approach. With methods to access mechanically axially chiral molecules in hand, their properties and applications can now be explored. Despite mechanically axially chiral (MAC) catenanes being recognized in 1961, their stereoselective synthesis had not been disclosed until now. Closer inspection of the MAC stereogenic unit has also led to the identification of an analogous, but unremarked upon, form of rotaxane stereochemistry and the conceptualization of a general approach to prepare MAC molecules stereoselectively.

Correlating ligand-to-metal charge transfer with voltage hysteresis in a Li-rich rock-salt compound exhibiting anionic redox

Anionic redox is a double-edged sword for Li-ion cathodes because it offers a transformational increase in energy density that is also negated by several detrimental drawbacks to its practical implementation. Among them, voltage hysteresis is the most troublesome because its origin is still unclear and under debate. Herein, we tackle this issue by designing a prototypical Li-rich cation-disordered rock-salt compound Li1.17Ti0.33Fe0.5O2 that shows anionic redox activity and exceptionally large voltage hysteresis while exhibiting a partially reversible Fe migration between octahedral and tetrahedral sites. Through combined in situ and ex situ spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate the existence of a non-equilibrium (adiabatic) redox pathway enlisting Fe3+/Fe4+ and O redox as opposed to the equilibrium (non-adiabatic) redox pathway involving sole O redox. We further show that the charge transfer from O(2p) lone pair states to Fe(3d) states involving sluggish structural distortion is responsible for voltage hysteresis. This study provides a general understanding of various voltage hysteresis signatures in the large family of Li-rich rock-salt compounds. The use of anionic redox chemistry in high-capacity Li-rich cathodes is being hampered by voltage hysteresis, the origin of which remains obscure. Now it has been shown that sluggish ligand-to-metal charge transfer kinetically traps an intermediate Fe4+ species and is responsible for voltage hysteresis in the prototypical Li-rich cation-disordered rock-salt Li1.17Ti0.33Fe0.5O2.

Direct conversion of white phosphorus to versatile phosphorus transfer reagents via oxidative onioation

The main feedstock for the value-added phosphorus chemicals used in industry and research is white phosphorus (P4), from which the key intermediate for forming P(III) compounds is PCl3. Owing to its high reactivity, syntheses based on PCl3 are often accompanied by product mixtures and laborious work-up procedures, so an alternative process to form a viable P(III) transfer reagent is desirable. Our concept of oxidative onioation, where white phosphorus is selectively converted into triflate salts of versatile P1 transfer reagents such as [P(LN)3][OTf]3 (LN is a cationic, N-based substituent; that is, 4-dimethylaminopyridinio), provides a convenient alternative for the implementation of P–O, P–N and P–C bonds while circumventing the use of PCl3. We use p-block element compounds of type RnE (for example, Ph3As or PhI) to access weak adducts between nitrogen Lewis bases LN and the corresponding dications [RnELN]2+. The proposed equilibrium between [RnELN]2+ + LN and [RnE(LN)2]2+ allows for the complete oxidative onioation of all six P–P bonds in P4 to yield highly reactive and versatile trications [P(LN)3]3+. White phosphorus (P4) is selectively transformed by oxidative onioation into salts of P1-transfer reagents that feature reactive P–N bonds. These P1 compounds can be used in P–N, P–O and P–C bond-forming reactions to form value-added phosphorus chemicals, representing a viable alternative to the most relevant, yet problematic, P(III) precursor, namely PCl3.

Enzyme-mediated nitric oxide production in vasoactive erythrocyte membrane-enclosed coacervate protocells

The design and construction of synthetic therapeutic protocells capable of establishing cognate chemical communication channels with living cells is an important challenge for synthetic biology and bio-engineering. Here we develop a step towards protocell-mediated nitric-oxide-induced vasodilation by constructing a new synthetic cell model based on bio-derived coacervate vesicles with high haemocompatibility and increased blood circulation times. The hybrid protocells are prepared by the spontaneous self-assembly of haemoglobin-containing erythrocyte membrane fragments on the surface of preformed polysaccharide–polynucleotide coacervate micro-droplets containing glucose oxidase. We use the sequestered enzymes to program a spatially coupled glucose oxidase/haemoglobin reaction cascade, which in the presence of glucose and hydroxyurea generates a protocell-mediated flux of nitric oxide that we exploit for in vitro and in vivo blood vessel vasodilation. Taken together, our results provide new opportunities for the development of endogenously organized cell-like entities (biocompatible micro-bots) geared specifically towards active interfacing with individual living cells and cell communities. The self-assembly of haemoglobin-containing erythrocyte membrane fragments onto the surface of preformed coacervates has been used to make hybrid synthetic cells that can initiate nitric-oxide-induced vasodilation. These synthetic cells encapsulate enzymes that generate a flux of nitric oxide, as well as exhibiting high haemocompatibility and increased blood circulation times.

Mechanically gated formation of donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts enabling mechanochemical multicolour soft lithography

Stress-sensitive molecules called mechanophores undergo productive chemical transformations in response to mechanical force. A variety of mechanochromic mechanophores, which change colour in response to stress, have been developed, but modulating the properties of the dyes generally requires the independent preparation of discrete derivatives. Here we introduce a mechanophore platform enabling mechanically gated multicolour chromogenic reactivity. The mechanophore is based on an activated furan precursor to donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) masked as a hetero-Diels–Alder adduct. Mechanochemical activation of the mechanophore unveils the DASA precursor, and subsequent reaction with a secondary amine generates an intensely coloured DASA. Critically, the properties of the DASA are controlled by the amine, and thus a single mechanophore can be differentiated post-activation to produce a wide range of functionally diverse DASAs. We highlight this system by establishing the concept of mechanochemical multicolour soft lithography whereby a complex multicolour composite image is printed into a mechanochemically active elastomer through an iterative process of localized compression followed by reaction with different amines. Mechanochemical generation of dyes with different photophysical properties generally requires the use of discrete mechanophore derivatives with unique chemical structures. Now it has been shown that diverse donor–acceptor Stenhouse adducts can be produced via a mechanically gated chromogenic reaction, enabling mechanochemical multicolour lithography.

Excitation energy transfer and vibronic coherence in intact phycobilisomes

The phycobilisome is an oligomeric chromoprotein complex that serves as the principal mid-visible light-harvesting system in cyanobacteria. Here we report the observation of excitation-energy-transfer pathways involving delocalized optical excitations of the bilin (linear tetrapyrrole) chromophores in intact phycobilisomes isolated from Fremyella diplosiphon. By using broadband multidimensional electronic spectroscopy with 6.7-fs laser pulses, we are able to follow the progress of excitation energy from the phycoerythrin disks at the ends of the phycobilisome’s rods to the C-phycocyanin disks along their length in &lt;600 fs. Oscillation maps show that coherent wavepacket motions prominently involving the hydrogen out-of-plane vibrations of the bilins mediate non-adiabatic relaxation of a manifold of vibronic exciton states. However, the charge-transfer character of the bilins in the allophycocyanin-containing segments localizes the excitations in the core of the phycobilisome, yielding a kinetic bottleneck that enables photoregulatory mechanisms to operate efficiently on the &gt;10-ps timescale. The principal mid-visible light-harvesting system in cyanobacteria is the phycobilisome. Now, using broadband multidimensional spectroscopy, delocalized vibronic excitations and sub-picosecond excitation transfer pathways have been observed in the rods of intact phycobilisomes. An observed kinetic bottleneck in the phycobilisome’s core arises from the intramolecular charge-transfer character of the bilin chromophores, enabling photoregulatory processes to operate on the &gt;10-ps timescale.

2-Oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes as saturated bioisosteres of the ortho-substituted phenyl ring

The ortho-substituted phenyl ring is a basic structural element in chemistry. It is found in more than three hundred drugs and agrochemicals. During the past decade, scientists have tried to replace the phenyl ring in bioactive compounds with saturated bioisosteres to obtain novel patentable structures. However, most of the research in this area has been devoted to the replacement of the para-substituted phenyl ring. Here we have developed saturated bioisosteres of the ortho-substituted phenyl ring with improved physicochemical properties: 2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes. Crystallographic analysis revealed that these structures and the ortho-substituted phenyl ring indeed have similar geometric properties. Replacement of the phenyl ring in marketed agrochemicals fluxapyroxad (BASF) and boscalid (BASF) with 2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes dramatically improved their water solubility, reduced lipophilicity and most importantly retained bioactivity. This work suggests an opportunity for chemists to replace the ortho-substituted phenyl ring in bioactive compounds with saturated bioisosteres in medicinal chemistry and agrochemistry. The ortho-substituted phenyl ring is a basic structural element in chemistry. Now, 2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have been developed as saturated bioisosteres of the ortho-substituted phenyl ring with improved physicochemical properties. Replacement of the phenyl ring with 2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes in marketed agrochemicals fluxapyroxad and boscalid improved water solubility, reduced lipophilicity and retained bioactivity.

Back-bonding between an electron-poor, high-oxidation-state metal and poor π-acceptor ligand in a uranium(v)–dinitrogen complex

A fundamental bonding model in coordination and organometallic chemistry is the synergic, donor–acceptor interaction between a metal and a neutral π-acceptor ligand, in which the ligand σ donates to the metal, which π back-bonds to the ligand. This interaction typically involves a metal with an electron-rich, mid-, low- or even negative oxidation state and a ligand with a π* orbital. Here, we report that treatment of a uranium–carbene complex with an organoazide produces a uranium(v)–bis(imido)–dinitrogen complex, stabilized by a lithium counterion. This complex, which was isolated in a crystalline form, involves an electron-poor, high-oxidation-state uranium(v) 5f1 ion that is π back-bonded to the poor π-acceptor ligand dinitrogen. We propose that this is made possible by a combination of cooperative heterobimetallic uranium–lithium effects and the presence of suitable ancillary ligands that render the uranium ion unusually electron rich. This electron-poor back-bonding could have implications for the field of dinitrogen activation. In coordination and organometallic chemistry, back-bonding between an electron-rich, typically mid- or low-oxidation-state d-block metal centre and a ligand with accepting π* orbitals is widespread. Now, such an interaction has been observed between unlikely partners—high-oxidation-state uranium(v) 5f1 ion and the poor π-acceptor ligand dinitrogen—in a U(v)–bis(imido)–N2 complex stabilized by a lithium counterion.

A chemoselective strategy for late-stage functionalization of complex small molecules with polypeptides and proteins

Conjugates between proteins and small molecules enable access to a vast chemical space that is not achievable with either type of molecule alone; however, the paucity of specific reactions capable of functionalizing proteins and natural products presents a formidable challenge for preparing conjugates. Here we report a strategy for conjugating electron-rich (hetero)arenes to polypeptides and proteins. Our bioconjugation technique exploits the electrophilic reactivity of an oxidized selenocysteine residue in polypeptides and proteins, and the electron-rich character of certain small molecules to provide bioconjugates in excellent yields under mild conditions. This conjugation chemistry enabled the synthesis of peptide–vancomycin conjugates without the prefunctionalization of vancomycin. These conjugates have an enhanced in vitro potency for resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Additionally, we show that a 6 kDa affibody protein and a 150 kDa immunoglobulin-G antibody could be modified without diminishing bioactivity. The preparation of conjugates between proteins and small molecules is often challenging and requires several synthetic steps to functionalize each component for conjugation. Now, a conjugation methodology that leverages an electrophilic Se–S bond of selenocysteine to create bioconjugates between polypeptides and complex small molecules has been described.

α-Synuclein aggregation nucleates through liquid–liquid phase separation

α-Synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation and amyloid formation is directly linked with Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis. However, the early events involved in this process remain unclear. Here, using the in vitro reconstitution and cellular model, we show that liquid–liquid phase separation of α-Syn precedes its aggregation. In particular, in vitro generated α-Syn liquid-like droplets eventually undergo a liquid-to-solid transition and form an amyloid hydrogel that contains oligomers and fibrillar species. Factors known to aggravate α-Syn aggregation, such as low pH, phosphomimetic substitution and familial Parkinson’s disease mutations, also promote α-Syn liquid–liquid phase separation and its subsequent maturation. We further demonstrate α-Syn liquid-droplet formation in cells. These cellular α-Syn droplets eventually transform into perinuclear aggresomes, the process regulated by microtubules. This work provides detailed insights into the phase-separation behaviour of natively unstructured α-Syn and its conversion to a disease-associated aggregated state, which is highly relevant in Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis. The mechanism of nucleation for α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation and amyloid formation in Parkinson’s disease is unclear. Now, α-Syn has been shown to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation and a liquid-to-solid-like transition leading to amyloid fibril formation. This raises the possibility that liquid–liquid phase separation is a key pathogenic mechanism behind α-Syn aggregation in Parkinson’s disease.

Ultrafast proton-coupled isomerization in the phototransformation of phytochrome

The biological function of phytochromes is triggered by an ultrafast photoisomerization of the tetrapyrrole chromophore biliverdin between two rings denoted C and D. The mechanism by which this process induces extended structural changes of the protein is unclear. Here we report ultrafast proton-coupled photoisomerization upon excitation of the parent state (Pfr) of bacteriophytochrome Agp2. Transient deprotonation of the chromophore’s pyrrole ring D or ring C into a hydrogen-bonded water cluster, revealed by a broad continuum infrared band, is triggered by electronic excitation, coherent oscillations and the sudden electric-field change in the excited state. Subsequently, a dominant fraction of the excited population relaxes back to the Pfr state, while ~35% follows the forward reaction to the photoproduct. A combination of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations and ultrafast visible and infrared spectroscopies demonstrates how proton-coupled dynamics in the excited state of Pfr leads to a restructured hydrogen-bond environment of early Lumi-F, which is interpreted as a trigger for downstream protein structural changes. Phytochromes regulate plant growth by sensing far-red light through the photoisomerization of their protein-bound chromophores. In the phytochrome Agp2, it has now been demonstrated that ultrafast proton-transfer occurs from the chromophore to a protein–water network before photoisomerization, inducing protein changes on the ultrafast timescale. These protein changes develop further on longer timescales, resulting in an activated protein conformation.

Weakly hydrated anions bind to polymers but not monomers in aqueous solutions

Weakly hydrated anions help to solubilize hydrophobic macromolecules in aqueous solutions, but small molecules comprising the same chemical constituents precipitate out when exposed to these ions. Here, this apparent contradiction is resolved by systematically investigating the interactions of NaSCN with polyethylene oxide oligomers and polymers of varying molecular weight. A combination of spectroscopic and computational results reveals that SCN− accumulates near the surface of polymers, but is excluded from monomers. This occurs because SCN− preferentially binds to the centre of macromolecular chains, where the local water hydrogen-bonding network is disrupted. These findings suggest a link between ion-specific effects and theories addressing how hydrophobic hydration is modulated by the size and shape of a hydrophobic entity. Weakly hydrated anions solubilize macromolecules but cause small molecules that are made from identical chemical constituents to precipitate out of aqueous solutions. Now, this phenomenon has been understood by demonstrating that the binding of anions to polymers is regulated by molecular curvature and interfacial water structure.

Broadband 2D IR spectroscopy reveals dominant asymmetric H5O2+ proton hydration structures in acid solutions

Given the critical role of the aqueous excess proton in redox chemistry, determining its structure and the mechanism of its transport in water are intense areas of experimental and theoretical research. The ultrafast dynamics of the proton’s hydration structure has made it extremely challenging to study experimentally. Using ultrafast broadband two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, we show that the vibrational spectrum of the aqueous proton is fully consistent with a protonated water complex broadly defined as a Zundel-like H5O2+ motif. Analysis of the inhomogeneously broadened proton stretch two-dimensional lineshape indicates an intrinsically asymmetric, low-barrier O–H+–O potential that exhibits surprisingly persistent distributions in both its asymmetry and O–O distance. This structural characterization has direct implications for the extent of delocalization exhibited by a proton’s excess charge and for the possible mechanisms of proton transport in water. Although ubiquitous throughout chemistry and biology, the structure and transport mechanism of the aqueous proton in solution remain elusive. Through advances in ultrafast broadband 2D IR spectroscopy, the structure of the aqueous proton is revealed to have a charge-delocalized H5O2+ Zundel-like core arrangement with surprisingly persistent structural heterogeneity.

Visible light enables catalytic formation of weak chemical bonds with molecular hydrogen

The synthesis of weak chemical bonds at or near thermodynamic potential is a fundamental challenge in chemistry, with applications ranging from catalysis to biology to energy science. Proton-coupled electron transfer using molecular hydrogen is an attractive strategy for synthesizing weak element–hydrogen bonds, but the intrinsic thermodynamics presents a challenge for reactivity. Here we describe the direct photocatalytic synthesis of extremely weak element–hydrogen bonds of metal amido and metal imido complexes, as well as organic compounds with bond dissociation free energies as low as 31 kcal mol−1. Key to this approach is the bifunctional behaviour of the chromophoric iridium hydride photocatalyst. Activation of molecular hydrogen occurs in the ground state and the resulting iridium hydride harvests visible light to enable spontaneous formation of weak chemical bonds near thermodynamic potential with no by-products. Photophysical and mechanistic studies corroborate radical-based reaction pathways and highlight the uniqueness of this photodriven approach in promoting new catalytic chemistry. The formation of weak chemical bonds at or near thermodynamic potential is a challenge in chemical synthesis and catalysis. A bifunctional iridium hydride catalyst has now been discovered that absorbs visible light and promotes proton-coupled electron transfer to a range of substrates—creating element–hydrogen bonds—using dihydrogen as the terminal reductant.

Ambient-light-induced intermolecular Coulombic decay in unbound pyridine monomers

Intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) is a process whereby photoexcited molecules relax by ionizing their neighbouring molecules. ICD is efficient when intermolecular interactions are active and consequently it is observed only in weakly bound systems, such as clusters and hydrogen-bonded systems. Here we report an efficient ICD between unbound molecules excited at ambient-light intensities. On the photoexcitation of gas-phase pyridine monomers, well below the ionization threshold and at low laser intensities, we detected the parent and heavier-than-parent cations. The isotropic emission of slow electrons revealed ICD as the underlying process. π–π* excitation in unbounded pyridine monomers triggered an associative interaction between them, which leads to an efficient three-centre ICD. The cation resulting from the molecular association of the three pyridine centres relaxed through fragmentation. This below-threshold ionization under ambient light has implications for the understanding of radiation damage and astrochemistry. Intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) is a process whereby a photoexcited molecule relaxes while ionizing a neighbouring molecule. ICD is efficient when intermolecular interactions are active and consequently it is usually observed in weakly bound systems. Now, an efficient ICD is shown to occur even between unbound pyridine molecules excited at ambient-light intensities.

Photodriven quantum teleportation of an electron spin state in a covalent donor–acceptor–radical system

Quantum teleportation transfers the quantum state of a system over an arbitrary distance from one location to another through the agency of quantum entanglement. Because quantum teleportation is essential to many aspects of quantum information science, it is important to establish this phenomenon in molecular systems whose structures and properties can be tailored by synthesis. Here, we demonstrate electron spin state teleportation in an ensemble of covalent organic donor–acceptor–stable radical (D–A–R•) molecules. Following preparation of a specific electron spin state on R• in a magnetic field using a microwave pulse, photoexcitation of A results in the formation of an entangled electron spin pair D•+–A•−. The spontaneous ultrafast chemical reaction D•+–A•−–R• → D•+–A–R− constitutes the Bell state measurement step necessary to carry out spin state teleportation. Quantum state tomography of the R• and D•+ spin states using pulse electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy shows that the spin state of R• is teleported to D•+ with high fidelity. Quantum teleportation moves the quantum state of a system between physical locations without losing its coherence, an essential criterion for emerging quantum information applications. Now, electron-spin-state teleportation in covalent organic electron donor–acceptor–stable radical molecules is demonstrated using entangled electron spins produced by photo-induced electron transfer.

Title: 
Side-impact collisions of Ar with NO

In the realm of molecular collision dynamics, stereochemistry refers to the dependence of the collision outcome on the mutual orientation of the colliding partners. This may involve directed end-on collisions along a molecular bond axis or encounters in which the partner approaches the bond of an oriented molecule from the side. Using both experiment and theory, we show here that in the simplest case of an inelastic collision between an atom and a nearly homonuclear diatom, in which the two atoms have almost the same mass, the scattering dynamics are very distinct for impacts on either side of the molecule. By recording the direction of the scattered particles after the collision, we demonstrate that the intensity of products scattered in the forward direction, near parallel to the initial motion, can be substantially controlled and even maximized by altering the side-on orientation of the quantum state selected NO molecules that collide with Ar atoms. In addition, our findings provide valuable information about the preferred collision mechanism and reveal interesting quantum interference effects. The relative orientation of molecules when they collide is of particular interest to chemists as it provides information on the preferred collision mechanism. Now, experiments in which NO molecules are oriented sideways to incoming Ar atoms show that the spatial manipulation of the collision partners provides a means to control the scattering outcome.

Title: 
Dinitrogen binding and activation at a molybdenum–iron–sulfur cluster

The Fe–S clusters of nitrogenases carry out the life-sustaining conversion of N2 to NH3. Although progress continues to be made in modelling the structural features of nitrogenase cofactors, no synthetic Fe–S cluster has been shown to form a well-defined coordination complex with N2. Here we report that embedding an [MoFe3S4] cluster in a protective ligand environment enables N2 binding at Fe. The bridging [MoFe3S4]2(μ-η1:η1-N2) complex thus prepared features a substantially weakened N–N bond despite the relatively high formal oxidation states of the metal centres. Substitution of one of the [MoFe3S4] cubanes with an electropositive Ti metalloradical induces additional charge transfer to the N2 ligand with generation of Fe–N multiple-bond character. Structural and spectroscopic analyses demonstrate that N2 activation is accompanied by shortened Fe–S distances and charge transfer from each Fe site, including those not directly bound to N2. These findings indicate that covalent interactions within the cluster play a critical role in N2 binding and activation. Although iron–sulfur cofactors are known to carry out biological nitrogen fixation, how these clusters bind dinitrogen remains poorly understood. Now, a dinitrogen complex of a synthetic iron–sulfur cluster has been characterized, and electronic cooperation in the cluster has been shown to result in strong N–N bond activation.

Stereoselective synthesis of a composite knot with nine crossings

The simultaneous synthesis of a molecular nine-crossing composite knot that contains three trefoil tangles of the same handedness and a $$9_7^3$$ link (a type of cyclic [3]catenane topologically constrained to always have at least three twists within the links) is reported. Both compounds contain high degrees of topological writhe (w = 9), a structural feature of supercoiled DNA. The entwined products are generated from the cyclization of a hexameric Fe(ii) circular helicate by ring-closing olefin metathesis, with the mixture of topological isomers formed as a result of different ligand connectivity patterns. The metal-coordinated composite knot was isolated by crystallization, the topology unambiguously proven by tandem mass spectrometry, with X-ray crystallography confirming that the 324-atom loop crosses itself nine times with matching handedness (all Δ or all Λ) at every metal centre within each molecule. Controlling the connectivity of the ligand end groups on circular metal helicate scaffolds provides an effective synthetic strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of composite knots and other complex molecular topologies. A composite knot with nine crossings of the same handedness has been prepared from a hexameric circular helicate in 41% yield in a two-step synthesis. An isomeric cyclic [3]catenane topologically constrained to always have at least three twists within the links is also formed. Both topologies have a high degree of writhe, analogous to that of supercoiled DNA.

Insights into the ribosome function from the structures of non-arrested ribosome–nascent chain complexes

During protein synthesis, the growing polypeptide threads through the ribosomal exit tunnel and modulates ribosomal activity by itself or by sensing various small molecules, such as metabolites or antibiotics, appearing in the tunnel. While arrested ribosome–nascent chain complexes (RNCCs) have been extensively studied structurally, the lack of a simple procedure for the large-scale preparation of peptidyl-tRNAs, intermediates in polypeptide synthesis that carry the growing chain, means that little attention has been given to RNCCs representing functionally active states of the ribosome. Here we report the facile synthesis of stably linked peptidyl-tRNAs through a chemoenzymatic approach based on native chemical ligation and use them to determine several structures of RNCCs in the functional pre-attack state of the peptidyl transferase centre. These structures reveal that C-terminal parts of the growing peptides adopt the same uniform β-strand conformation stabilized by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds with the universally conserved 23S rRNA nucleotides, and explain how the ribosome synthesizes growing peptides containing various sequences with comparable efficiencies. Synthesis of peptidyl-tRNAs is challenging because there are no enzymes that can directly attach the desired peptide to tRNA. Now it has been shown that a chemoenzymatic approach based on native chemical ligation can be used for the semi-synthesis of peptidyl-tRNAs for structural/biochemical studies of arrested and non-arrested ribosome complexes.

Title: 
Engineering an efficient and enantioselective enzyme for the Morita–Baylis–Hillman reaction

The combination of computational design and directed evolution could offer a general strategy to create enzymes with new functions. So far, this approach has delivered enzymes for a handful of model reactions. Here we show that new catalytic mechanisms can be engineered into proteins to accelerate more challenging chemical transformations. Evolutionary optimization of a primitive design afforded an efficient and enantioselective enzyme (BH32.14) for the Morita–Baylis–Hillman (MBH) reaction. BH32.14 is suitable for preparative-scale transformations, accepts a broad range of aldehyde and enone coupling partners and is able to promote selective monofunctionalizations of dialdehydes. Crystallographic, biochemical and computational studies reveal that BH32.14 operates via a sophisticated catalytic mechanism comprising a His23 nucleophile paired with a judiciously positioned Arg124. This catalytic arginine shuttles between conformational states to stabilize multiple oxyanion intermediates and serves as a genetically encoded surrogate of privileged bidentate hydrogen-bonding catalysts (for example, thioureas). This study demonstrates that elaborate catalytic devices can be built from scratch to promote demanding multi-step processes not observed in nature. Directed evolution of a primitive computationally designed enzyme has produced an efficient and enantioselective biocatalyst for the Morita–Baylis–Hillman reaction. The engineered enzyme uses a designed histidine nucleophile operating in synergy with a catalytic arginine that emerged during evolution and serves as a genetically encoded surrogate of privileged bidentate hydrogen-bonding catalysts.

Total synthesis of terpenes via palladium-catalysed cyclization strategy

Nature’s synthetic plans to construct molecules have been developed over millions of years of evolution and frequently prove to be among the most sophisticated. Mimicking nature’s route can be a direct and feasible way for synthetic organic chemists to construct complicated molecules. However, lacking nature’s ability to manipulate enzymes often prevents us from reproducing the same route. Modifying nature’s approaches can provide a simpler synthetic alternative to access complex structural target molecules. Here we report a strategy that simplifies the synthesis of terpenes by inverting the order of nature’s two-phase biosynthesis route. We first unite simple molecules into a polyfunctionalized linear polyenyne, with all the desired carbons and oxygens in the targeted places. This compound then undergoes polyenyne cycloisomerization, in the presence of all the functional groups, to give polyoxidized terpenes. The key reaction is a palladium-catalysed polyenyne cycloisomerization that not only tolerates the presence of all of the oxygen functionalities, but also is facilitated by them. Inverting the order of nature’s two-phase biosynthesis of terpenes offers a strategy by which the synthesis of these compounds can be simplified. The key reaction is a palladium-catalysed polyenyne cycloisomerization that not only tolerates the presence of all of the oxygen functionalities but also is facilitated by them.

Copper atom-pair catalyst anchored on alloy nanowires for selective and efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 could play an important role in addressing climate-change issues and global energy demands as part of a carbon-neutral energy cycle. Single-atom catalysts can display outstanding electrocatalytic performance; however, given their single-site nature they are usually only amenable to reactions that involve single molecules. For processes that involve multiple molecules, improved catalytic properties could be achieved through the development of atomically dispersed catalysts with higher complexities. Here we report a catalyst that features two adjacent copper atoms, which we call an ‘atom-pair catalyst’, that work together to carry out the critical bimolecular step in CO2 reduction. The atom-pair catalyst features stable Cu10–Cu1x+ pair structures, with Cu1x+ adsorbing H2O and the neighbouring Cu10 adsorbing CO2, which thereby promotes CO2 activation. This results in a Faradaic efficiency for CO generation above 92%, with the competing hydrogen evolution reaction almost completely suppressed. Experimental characterization and density functional theory revealed that the adsorption configuration reduces the activation energy, which generates high selectivity, activity and stability under relatively low potentials. Anchored single-atom catalysts have recently been shown to be very active for various processes, however, a catalyst that features two adjacent copper atoms—which we call an atom-pair catalyst—is now reported. The Cu10–Cu1x+ pair structures work together to carry out the critical bimolecular step in CO2 reduction.

Title: 
Photoredox catalysis with aryl sulfonium salts enables site-selective late-stage fluorination

Photoredox catalysis, especially in combination with transition metal catalysis, can produce redox states of transition metal catalysts to facilitate challenging bond formations that are not readily accessible in conventional redox catalysis. For arene functionalization, metallophotoredox catalysis has successfully made use of the same leaving groups as those valuable in conventional cross-coupling catalysis, such as bromide. Yet the redox potentials of common photoredox catalysts are not sufficient to reduce most aryl bromides, so synthetically useful aryl radicals are often not directly available. Therefore, the development of a distinct leaving group more appropriately matched in redox potential could enable new reactivity manifolds for metallophotoredox catalysis, especially if arylcopper(iii) complexes are accessible, from which the most challenging bond-forming reactions can occur. Here we show the conceptual advantages of aryl thianthrenium salts for metallophotoredox catalysis, and their utility in site-selective late-stage aromatic fluorination. Despite the potential of fluorinated compounds in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, the formation of C–F bonds remains challenging. It has now been shown that aryl sulfonium salts, which can be made by site-selective C–H functionalization, have advantageous photoredox reactivity compared to conventional (pseudo)halides and can be used for late-stage C–H fluorination.

Title: 
A terminal neptunium(V)–mono(oxo) complex

Neptunium was the first actinide element to be artificially synthesized, yet, compared with its more famous neighbours uranium and plutonium, is less conspicuously studied. Most neptunium chemistry involves the neptunyl di(oxo)-motif, and transuranic compounds with one metal–ligand multiple bond are rare, being found only in extended-structure oxide, fluoride or oxyhalide materials. These combinations stabilize the required high oxidation states, which are otherwise challenging to realize for transuranic ions. Here we report the synthesis, isolation and characterization of a stable molecular neptunium(V)–mono(oxo) triamidoamine complex. We describe a strong Np≡O triple bond with dominant 5f-orbital contributions and σu &gt; πu energy ordering, akin to terminal uranium-nitrides and di(oxo)-actinyls, but not the uranium–mono(oxo) triple bonds or other actinide multiple bonds reported so far. This work demonstrates that molecular high-oxidation-state transuranic complexes with a single metal–ligand bond can be stabilized and studied in isolation. Neptunium was the first actinide to be artificially synthesized, yet its chemistry has remained relatively unexplored. Most neptunium chemistry involves the neptunyl di(oxo) motif, and transuranic compounds with only one metal–ligand multiple bond are generally rare. Now, a stable complex of neptunium in the +5 oxidation state has been isolated that features a single terminal Np–O multiple bond.

Ultrafast dynamics of low-energy electron attachment via a non-valence correlation-bound state

The primary electron-attachment process in electron-driven chemistry represents one of the most fundamental chemical transformations with wide-ranging importance in science and technology. However, the mechanistic detail of the seemingly simple reaction of an electron and a neutral molecule to form an anion remains poorly understood, particularly at very low electron energies. Here, time-resolved photoelectron imaging was used to probe the electron-attachment process to a non-polar molecule using time-resolved methods. An initially populated diffuse non-valence state of the anion that is bound by correlation forces evolves coherently in ∼30 fs into a valence state of the anion. The extreme efficiency with which the correlation-bound state serves as a doorway state for low-energy electron attachment explains a number of electron-driven processes, such as anion formation in the interstellar medium and electron attachment to fullerenes. The capture of an electron by a molecule represents one of the most fundamental chemical transformations, but its mechanism at very low energies remains unclear. Now, it is shown that low-energy electron attachment to hexafluorobenzene is mediated by a non-valence correlation-bound state of the anion.

Abiotic reduction of ketones with silanes catalysed by carbonic anhydrase through an enzymatic zinc hydride

Enzymatic reactions through mononuclear metal hydrides are unknown in nature, despite the prevalence of such intermediates in the reactions of synthetic transition-metal catalysts. If metalloenzymes could react through abiotic intermediates like these, then the scope of enzyme-catalysed reactions would expand. Here we show that zinc-containing carbonic anhydrase enzymes catalyse hydride transfers from silanes to ketones with high enantioselectivity. We report mechanistic data providing strong evidence that the process involves a mononuclear zinc hydride. This work shows that abiotic silanes can act as reducing equivalents in an enzyme-catalysed process and that monomeric hydrides of electropositive metals, which are typically unstable in protic environments, can be catalytic intermediates in enzymatic processes. Overall, this work bridges a gap between the types of transformation in molecular catalysis and biocatalysis. Enzymatic reactions involving mononuclear metal hydrides are unknown in nature, despite the prevalence of such intermediates in synthetic transition-metal catalysed reactions. Now, it has been shown that zinc-containing carbonic anhydrase enzymes can catalyse hydride transfers from silanes to ketones with high enantioselectivity and there is evidence to support the intermediacy of a mononuclear zinc hydride.

Evidence for a vibrational phase-dependent isotope effect on the photochemistry of vision

Vibronic coupling is key to efficient energy flow in molecular systems and a critical component of most mechanisms invoking quantum effects in biological processes. Despite increasing evidence for coherent coupling of electronic states being mediated by vibrational motion, it is not clear how and to what degree properties associated with vibrational coherence such as phase and coupling of atomic motion can impact the efficiency of light-induced processes under natural, incoherent illumination. Here, we show that deuteration of the H11–C11=C12–H12 double-bond of the 11-cis retinal chromophore in the visual pigment rhodopsin significantly and unexpectedly alters the photoisomerization yield while inducing smaller changes in the ultrafast isomerization dynamics assignable to known isotope effects. Combination of these results with non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations reveals a vibrational phase-dependent isotope effect that we suggest is an intrinsic attribute of vibronically coherent photochemical processes. Isotope effects provide deep insight into mechanisms of chemical and biochemical processes. Now, it has been shown that the pattern of isotopic substitution of the isomerizing bond of the retinal chromophore in the visual pigment rhodopsin significantly alters the reaction quantum yield—revealing a vibrational phase-dependent isotope effect.

Structural resolution of a small organic molecule by serial X-ray free-electron laser and electron crystallography

Structure analysis of small crystals is important in areas ranging from synthetic organic chemistry to pharmaceutical and material sciences, as many compounds do not yield large crystals. Here we present the detailed characterization of the structure of an organic molecule, rhodamine-6G, determined at a resolution of 0.82 Å by an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). Direct comparison of this structure with that obtained by electron crystallography from the same sample batch of microcrystals shows that both methods can accurately distinguish the position of some of the hydrogen atoms, depending on the type of chemical bond in which they are involved. Variations in the distances measured by XFEL and electron diffraction reflect the expected differences in X-ray and electron scatterings. The reliability for atomic coordinates was found to be better with XFEL, but the electron beam showed a higher sensitivity to charges. The structural analysis of small crystals has remained challenging. Now, the structure of a small organic molecule, rhodamine-6G, has been resolved from microcrystals using an X-ray free-electron laser and electron diffraction. The former showed better reliability for atomic coordinates, whereas the latter was more sensitive to charges; both techniques accurately determined the position of hydrogen atoms.

Precision native polysaccharides from living polymerization of anhydrosugars

The composition, sequence, length and type of glycosidic linkage of polysaccharides profoundly affect their biological and physical properties. However, investigation of the structure–function relationship of polysaccharides is hampered by difficulties in accessing well-defined polysaccharides in sufficient quantities. Here we report a chemical approach to precision polysaccharides with native glycosidic linkages via living cationic ring-opening polymerization of 1,6-anhydrosugars. We synthesized well-defined polysaccharides with tunable molecular weight, low dispersity and excellent regio- and stereo-selectivity using a boron trifluoride etherate catalyst and glycosyl fluoride initiators. Computational studies revealed that the reaction propagated through the monomer α-addition to the oxocarbenium and was controlled by the reversible deactivation of the propagating oxocarbenium to form the glycosyl fluoride dormant species. Our method afforded a facile and scalable pathway to multiple biologically relevant precision polysaccharides, including d-glucan, d-mannan and an unusual l-glucan. We demonstrated that catalytic depolymerization of precision polysaccharides efficiently regenerated monomers, suggesting their potential utility as a class of chemically recyclable materials with tailored thermal and mechanical properties. The inability to access well-defined polysaccharides in sufficient quantities has hampered our understanding of their structure–function relationships. Now it has been shown that native precision polysaccharides can be readily prepared via living polymerization of 1,6-anhydrosugars. The obtained polymers display excellent chemical recyclability, suggesting their potential utility as a class of sustainable materials.

Title: 
Iterative synthesis of 1,3-polyboronic esters with high stereocontrol and application to the synthesis of bahamaolide A

Polyketide natural products often contain common repeat motifs, for example, propionate, acetate and deoxypropionate, and so can be synthesized by iterative processes. We report here a highly efficient iterative strategy for the synthesis of polyacetates based on boronic ester homologation that does not require functional group manipulation between iterations. This process involves sequential asymmetric diboration of a terminal alkene, forming a 1,2-bis(boronic ester), followed by regio- and stereoselective homologation of the primary boronic ester with a butenyl metallated carbenoid to generate a 1,3-bis(boronic ester). Each transformation independently controls the stereochemical configuration, making the process highly versatile, and the sequence can be iterated prior to stereospecific oxidation of the 1,3-polyboronic ester to yield the 1,3-polyol. This methodology has been applied to a 14-step synthesis of the oxopolyene macrolide bahamaolide A, and the versatility of the 1,3-polyboronic esters has been demonstrated in various stereospecific transformations, leading to polyalkenes, -alkynes, -ketones and -aromatics with full stereocontrol. Polyketide natural products often contain common repeat motifs that are synthesized using iterative processes. Now a masked 1,3-diol motif, generated by a two-step process based on boronic ester homologation, has enabled the efficient iterative synthesis of polyacetates, including bahamaolide A. In addition to oxidation, the 1,3-polyboronic esters were shown to undergo various stereospecific transformations.

Convergence of multiple synthetic paradigms in a universally programmable chemical synthesis machine

Although the automatic synthesis of molecules has been established, each reaction class uses bespoke hardware. This means that the connection of multi-step syntheses in a single machine to run many different protocols and reactions is not possible, as manual intervention is required. Here we show how the Chemputer synthesis robot can be programmed to perform many different reactions, including solid-phase peptide synthesis, iterative cross-coupling and accessing reactive, unstable diazirines in a single, unified system with high yields and purity. Developing universal and modular hardware that can be automated using one software system makes a wide variety of batch chemistry accessible. This is shown by our system, which performed around 8,500 operations while reusing only 22 distinct steps in 10 unique modules, with the code able to access 17 different reactions. We also demonstrate a complex convergent robotic synthesis of a peptide reacted with a diazirine—a process requiring 12 synthetic steps. Automated synthesis technologies are often highly specialized, focusing only on a narrow set of reaction classes. Now, solid-phase peptide synthesis, iterative Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling and diazirine chemistry have all been automated using the same universal platform architecture. A convergent 12-step synthesis demonstrates the utility of the reported Chemputer system.

Title: 
Use of α-trifluoromethyl carbanions for palladium-catalysed asymmetric cycloadditions

The development of new methodologies that enable chemo- and stereoselective construction of fluorinated substituents, such as the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, plays an essential role in the synthesis of new pharmaceutical agents. The exceptional ability of the CF3 moiety to prevent in vivo metabolism as well as improve other pharmacological properties has led to numerous innovative strategies for installing this unique functional group. One potential yet underdeveloped approach to access these trifluoromethylated products is direct substitution of α-trifluoromethyl carbanions. Although the electron-withdrawing nature of the CF3 group should facilitate deprotonation of adjacent hydrogens, the propensity of the resulting carbanions to undergo α-elimination of fluoride renders this process highly challenging. Herein, we describe a new strategy for stabilizing and utilizing transient α-trifluoromethyl carbanions that relies on a neighbouring cationic π-allyl palladium complex. These palladium-stabilized zwitterions participate in asymmetric [3 + 2] cycloadditions with a broad range of acceptors, generating valuable di- and trifluoromethylated cyclopentanes, pyrrolidines and tetrahydrofurans. Although methods exist for the construction of CF3-containing stereocentres, the utilization of α-trifluoromethyl carbanions remains challenging because of the propensity for fluoride elimination. A strategy has now been developed to stabilize these carbanions through a neighbouring cationic Pd complex and the corresponding Pd-stabilized zwitterions participate in asymmetric cycloadditions with a broad range of acceptors.

Structure-based inhibitors of tau aggregation

Aggregated tau protein is associated with over 20 neurological disorders, which include Alzheimer's disease. Previous work has shown that tau's sequence segments VQIINK and VQIVYK drive its aggregation, but inhibitors based on the structure of the VQIVYK segment only partially inhibit full-length tau aggregation and are ineffective at inhibiting seeding by full-length fibrils. Here we show that the VQIINK segment is the more powerful driver of tau aggregation. Two structures of this segment determined by the cryo-electron microscopy method micro-electron diffraction explain its dominant influence on tau aggregation. Of practical significance, the structures lead to the design of inhibitors that not only inhibit tau aggregation but also inhibit the ability of exogenous full-length tau fibrils to seed intracellular tau in HEK293 biosensor cells into amyloid. We also raise the possibility that the two VQIINK structures represent amyloid polymorphs of tau that may account for a subset of prion-like strains of tau. Tau aggregation is associated with Alzheimer's disease and dozens of related dementias. Now atomic structures of the aggregation-prone segment VQIINK in repeat 2 of tau have been reported. Inhibitors designed using these structures block seeding by full-length tau better than inhibitors that target the VQIVYK aggregation segment in repeat 3.

Cold photo-carving of halogen-bonded co-crystals of a dye and a volatile co-former using visible light

The formation of co-crystals by the assembly of molecules with complementary molecular recognition functionalities is a popular strategy to design or improve a range of solid-state properties, including those relevant for pharmaceuticals, photo- or thermoresponsive materials and organic electronics. Here, we report halogen-bonded co-crystals of a fluorinated azobenzene derivative with a volatile component—either dioxane or pyrazine—that can be cut, carved or engraved with low-power visible light. This cold photo-carving process is enabled by the co-crystallization of a light-absorbing azo dye with a volatile component, which gives rise to materials that can be selectively disassembled with micrometre precision using low-power, non-burning laser irradiation or a commercial confocal microscope. The ability to shape co-crystals in three dimensions using laser powers of 0.5–20 mW—substantially lower than those used for metals, ceramics or polymers—is rationalized by photo-carving that targets the disruption of weak supramolecular interactions, rather than the covalent bonds or ionic structures targeted by conventional laser beam or focused ion beam machining processes. Halogen-bonded co-crystals of a fluorinated azobenzene derivative and a volatile co-former can be cut, carved or engraved with micrometre-scale precision using low-power visible light. The proposed mechanism involves the local evaporation of the volatile component followed by recrystallization of the azobenzene co-former near the edge of the irradiation area.

Bismuth radical catalysis in the activation and coupling of redox-active electrophiles

Radical cross-coupling reactions represent a revolutionary tool to make C(sp3)–C and C(sp3)–heteroatom bonds by means of transition metals and photoredox or electrochemical approaches. However, the use of main-group elements to harness this type of reactivity has been little explored. Here we show how a low-valency bismuth complex is able to undergo one-electron oxidative addition with redox-active alkyl-radical precursors, mimicking the behaviour of first-row transition metals. This reactivity paradigm for bismuth gives rise to well-defined oxidative addition complexes, which could be fully characterized in solution and in the solid state. The resulting Bi(III)–C(sp3) intermediates display divergent reactivity patterns depending on the α-substituents of the alkyl fragment. Mechanistic investigations of this reactivity led to the development of a bismuth-catalysed C(sp3)–N cross-coupling reaction that operates under mild conditions and accommodates synthetically relevant NH-heterocycles as coupling partners. The use of main-group elements in radical cross-coupling reactions has been little explored. Now, a low-valency bismuth complex has been shown to emulate the behaviour of first-row transition metals and undergo single-electron-transfer oxidative addition to redox-active electrophiles, leading to the development of a bismuth-catalysed C–N coupling reaction between amines and carboxylic acids.

A far-red hybrid voltage indicator enabled by bioorthogonal engineering of rhodopsin on live neurons

Membrane potential is a key aspect of cellular signalling and is dynamically regulated by an array of ion-selective pumps and channels. Fluorescent voltage indicators enable non-invasive optical recording of the cellular membrane potential with high spatial resolution. Here, we report a palette of bright and sensitive hybrid voltage indicators (HVIs) with fluorescence intensities sensitive to changes in membrane potential via electrochromic Förster resonance energy transfer. Enzyme-mediated site-specific incorporation of a probe, followed by an inverse-electron-demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition, was used to create enhanced voltage-sensing rhodopsins with hybrid dye–protein architectures. The most sensitive indicator, HVI-Cy3, displays high voltage sensitivity (−39% ΔF/F0 per 100 mV) and millisecond response kinetics, enabling optical recording of action potentials at a sampling rate of 400 Hz over 10 min across a large neuronal population. The far-red indicator HVI-Cy5 could be paired with optogenetic actuators and green/red-emitting fluorescent indicators, allowing an all-optical investigation of neuronal electrophysiology. Voltage imaging is a powerful technique for studying electrical signalling in neurons. A palette of bright and sensitive voltage indicators has now been developed via enzyme-mediated ligation and Diels–Alder cycloaddition. Among these, a far-red indicator faithfully reports neuronal action potential dynamics with an excitation spectrum orthogonal to optogenetic actuators and green/red-emitting biosensors.

Title: 
Chemically stable polyarylether-based covalent organic frameworks

The development of crystalline porous materials with high chemical stability is of paramount importance for their practical application. Here, we report the synthesis of polyarylether-based covalent organic frameworks (PAE-COFs) with high crystallinity, porosity and chemical stability, including towards water, owing to the inert nature of their polyarylether-based building blocks. The PAE-COFs are synthesized through nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions between ortho-difluoro benzene and catechol building units, which form ether linkages. The resulting materials are shown to be stable against harsh chemical environments including boiling water, strong acids and bases, and oxidation and reduction conditions. Their stability surpasses the performance of other known crystalline porous materials such as zeolites, metal–organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks. We also demonstrate the post-synthetic functionalization of these materials with carboxyl or amino functional groups. The functionalized PAE-COFs combine porosity, high stability and recyclability. A preliminary application of these materials is demonstrated with the removal of antibiotics from water over a wide pH range. The development of porous, crystalline materials with high chemical stability is crucial for their practical uses. Now, polyarylether-based covalent organic frameworks (PAE-COFs) have been synthesized that show high crystallinity and porosity, as well as good stability against harsh chemical environments including boiling water and strong acids and bases.

Title: 
Catalytic promiscuity enabled by photoredox catalysis in nicotinamide-dependent oxidoreductases

Strategies that provide enzymes with the ability to catalyse non-natural reactions are of considerable synthetic value. Photoredox catalysis has proved adept at expanding the synthetic repertoire of existing catalytic platforms, yet, in the realm of biocatalysis it has primarily been used for cofactor regeneration. Here we show that photoredox catalysts can be used to enable new catalytic function in nicotinamide-dependent enzymes. Under visible-light irradiation, xanthene-based photocatalysts enable a double-bond reductase to catalyse an enantioselective deacetoxylation. Mechanistic experiments support the intermediacy of an α-acyl radical, formed after the elimination of acetate. Isotopic labelling experiments support nicotinamide as the source of the hydrogen atom. Preliminary calculations and mechanistic experiments suggest that binding to the protein attenuates the reduction potential of the starting material, an important feature for localizing radical formation to the enzyme active site. The generality of this approach is highlighted with the radical dehalogenation of α-bromoamides catalysed by ketoreductases with Eosin Y as a photocatalyst. Enzymes are powerful catalysts for chemical synthesis because they are capable of providing unparalleled levels of selectivity; however, in nature they only catalyse a limited collection of reactions. Now, it has been shown that non-natural reactions that proceed via free-radical intermediates can be catalysed with high selectivity by using an exogenous photoredox catalyst in conjunction with enzymes.

Title: 
Amino-acid-encoded biocatalytic self-assembly enables the formation of transient conducting nanostructures

Aqueous compatible supramolecular materials hold promise for applications in environmental remediation, energy harvesting and biomedicine. One remaining challenge is to actively select a target structure from a multitude of possible options, in response to chemical signals, while maintaining constant, physiological conditions. Here, we demonstrate the use of amino acids to actively decorate a self-assembling core molecule in situ, thereby controlling its amphiphilicity and consequent mode of assembly. The core molecule is the organic semiconductor naphthalene diimide, functionalized with D- and L- tyrosine methyl esters as competing reactive sites. In the presence of α-chymotrypsin and a selected encoding amino acid, kinetic competition between ester hydrolysis and amidation results in covalent or non-covalent amino acid incorporation, and variable supramolecular self-assembly pathways. Taking advantage of the semiconducting nature of the naphthalene diimide core, electronic wires could be formed and subsequently degraded, giving rise to temporally regulated electro-conductivity. Amino acids have now been used as chemical inputs to provide control over self-assembly in semiconducting structures. This approach enables temporal control over the formation of nanostructures and consequently control over their transient electronic conductivity.

Title: 
Three concomitant C–C dissociation pathways during the mechanical activation of an N-heterocyclic carbene precursor

Chemical reactions usually proceed through a radical, concerted or ionic mechanism; transformations in which all three mechanisms occur are rare. In polymer mechanochemistry, a mechanical force, transduced along polymer chains, is used to activate covalent bonds in mechanosensitive molecules (mechanophores). Cleavage of a C–C bond often follows a homolytic pathway, but some mechanophores have also been designed that react in a concerted or, more rarely, a heterolytic manner. Here, using 1H- and 19F-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with deuterium labelling, we show that the dissociation of a mechanophore built around an N-heterocyclic carbene precursor proceeds with the rupture of a C–C bond through concomitant heterolytic, concerted and homolytic pathways. The distribution of products probably arises from a post-transition-state bifurcation in the reaction pathway, and their relative proportion is dictated by the polarization of the scissile C–C bond. Chemical reactions usually proceed through either a radical, concerted or ionic mechanism; transformations in which all three mechanisms occur are rare. Now, the mechanical dissociation of an N-heterocyclic carbene precursor has been shown to proceed with the rupture of a C–C bond through concomitant heterolytic, concerted and homolytic pathways.

Title: 
The catalytic dwell in ATPases is not crucial for movement against applied torque

The ATPase-catalysed conversion of ATP to ADP is a fundamental process in biology. During the hydrolysis of ATP, the α3β3 domain undergoes conformational changes while the central stalk (γ/D) rotates unidirectionally. Experimental studies have suggested that different catalytic mechanisms operate depending on the type of ATPase, but the structural and energetic basis of these mechanisms remains unclear. In particular, it is not clear how the positions of the catalytic dwells influence the energy transduction. Here we show that the observed dwell positions, unidirectional rotation and movement against the applied torque are reflections of the free-energy surface of the systems. Instructively, we determine that the dwell positions do not substantially affect the stopping torque. Our results suggest that the three resting states and the pathways that connect them should not be treated equally. The current work demonstrates how the free-energy landscape determines the behaviour of different types of ATPases. Despite the fundamental role of ATPase in catalysing ATP hydrolysis, the structural and energetic aspects of this process are not fully understood. Coarse-grained computational models have now been used to calculate the free-energy surfaces of different types of ATPases. The catalytic dwell is shown not to be crucial for movement against applied torque.

A genetically encoded photosensitizer protein facilitates the rational design of a miniature photocatalytic CO2-reducing enzyme

Photosensitizers, which harness light energy to upgrade weak reductants to strong reductants, are pivotal components of the natural and artificial photosynthesis machineries. However, it has proved difficult to enhance and expand their functions through genetic engineering. Here we report a genetically encoded, 27 kDa photosensitizer protein (PSP), which facilitates the rational design of miniature photocatalytic CO2-reducing enzymes. Visible light drives PSP efficiently into a long-lived triplet excited state (PSP*), which reacts rapidly with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to generate a super-reducing radical (PSP•), which is strong enough to reduce many CO2-reducing catalysts. We determined the three-dimensional structure of PSP• at 1.8 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. Genetic engineering enabled the site-specific attachment of a nickel–terpyridine complex and the modular optimization of the photochemical properties of PSP, the chromophore/catalytic centre distance and the catalytic centre microenvironment, which culminated in a miniature photocatalytic CO2-reducing enzyme that has a CO2/CO conversion quantum efficiency of 2.6%. A 27 kDa photosensitizer protein (PSP) has now been developed and used to design a miniature photocatalytic CO2-reducing enzyme. Visible light drives the PSP efficiently to the long-lived triplet excited state (PSP*), and then to a super-reducing radical (PSP•), which is strong enough to reduce many CO2-reducing catalysts. The 3D structure of PSP• at 1.8 Å resolution was determined by X-ray crystallography.

Title: 
A cyclase that catalyses competing 2 + 2 and 4 + 2 cycloadditions

Cycloaddition reactions are among the most widely used reactions in chemical synthesis. Nature achieves these cyclization reactions with a variety of enzymes, including Diels–Alderases that catalyse concerted 4 + 2 cycloadditions, but biosynthetic enzymes with 2 + 2 cyclase activity have yet to be discovered. Here we report that PloI4, a β-barrel-fold protein homologous to the exo-selective 4 + 2 cyclase that functions in the biosynthesis of pyrroindomycins, catalyses competitive 2 + 2 and 4 + 2 cycloaddition reactions. PloI4 is believed to catalyse an endo-4 + 2 cycloaddition in the biosynthesis of pyrrolosporin A; however, when the substrate precursor of pyrroindomycins was treated with PloI4, an exo-2 + 2 adduct was produced in addition to the exo- and endo-4 + 2 adducts. Biochemical characterizations, computational analyses, (co)crystal structures and mutagenesis outcomes have allowed the catalytic versatility of PloI4 to be rationalized. Mechanistic studies involved the directed engineering of PloI4 to variants that produced the exo-4 + 2, endo-4 + 2 or exo-2 + 2 product preferentially. This work illustrates an enzymatic thermal 2 + 2 cycloaddition and provides evidence of a process through which an enzyme evolves along with its substrate for specialization and activity improvement. Cycloaddition reactions are among the most useful reactions in chemical synthesis, but biosynthetic enzymes with 2 + 2 cyclase activity have yet to be observed. Now it is shown that a β-barrel-fold protein catalyses competitive 2 + 2 and 4 + 2 cycloaddition reactions. This protein can be engineered to preferentially produce the exo-2 + 2, exo-4 + 2 or endo-4 + 2 product.

Title: 
Planar π-extended cycloparaphenylenes featuring an all-armchair edge topology

The [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs)—n para-linked phenylenes that form a closed-loop—have attracted substantial attention due to their unique cyclic structure and highly effective para-conjugation leading to a myriad of fascinating electronic and optoelectronic properties. However, their strained topology prevents the π-extension of CPPs to convert them either into armchair nanobelts or planarized CPP macrocycles. Here we successfully tackle this long-standing challenge and present the bottom-up synthesis and characterization of atomically precise in-plane π-extended [12]CPP on Au(111) by low-temperature scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy combined with density functional theory. The planar π-extended CPP is a nanographene with an all-armchair edge topology. The exclusive para-conjugation at the periphery yields delocalized electronic states and the planarization maximizes the overlap of p orbitals, which both reduce the bandgap compared to conventional CPPs. Calculations predict ring currents and global aromaticity in the doubly charged system. The intriguing planar ring topology and unique electronic properties make planar π-extended CPPs promising quantum materials. The strained topology of [n]paracyclophenylenes ([n]CPPs) typically prevents their π sysytem from being extended, but now the formation of a planar π-extended CPP has been achieved through a bottom-up on-surface synthesis approach. The planar π-extended [12]CPP produced by this method is a nanographene featuring an all-armchair edge, which leads to delocalized electronic states around the entire ring.

Title: 
Ruthenium-catalysed multicomponent synthesis of the 1,3-dienyl-6-oxy polyketide motif

Polyketide natural products are an important class of biologically active compounds. Although substantial progress has been made on the synthesis of repetitive polyketide motifs through the iterative application of a single reaction type, synthetic access to more diverse motifs that require more than one type of carbon–carbon bond connection remains a challenge. Here we describe a catalytic, multicomponent method for the synthesis of the privileged polyketide 1,3-dienyl-6-oxy motif. The method allows for the formation of two new carbon–carbon bonds and two stereodefined olefins. It generates products that contain up to three contiguous sp3 stereocentres with a high stereoselectivity in a single operation and can be used to generate chiral products. The successful development of this methodology relies on the remarkable efficiency of the ruthenium-catalysed alkene–alkyne coupling reaction between readily available vinyl boronic acids and alkynes to provide unsymmetrical 3-boryl-1,4-diene reagents. In the presence of carbonyl compounds, these reagents undergo highly diastereoselective allylations to afford the desired 1,3-dienyl-6-oxy motif and enable complex polyketide synthesis in a rapid and asymmetric fashion. A ruthenium-catalysed multicomponent reaction provides rapid and tunable access to 1,3-dienyl-6-oxy polyketide motifs. An initial alkene–alkyne coupling produces unsymmetrical 3-boryl-1,4-dienes. Allylation of aldehydes and ketones with these products is highly diastereoselective and results in the formation of two carbon–carbon bonds, two stereodefined olefins and up to three contiguous sp3 stereocentres.

Title: 
Hydrogenation catalyst generates cyclic peptide stereocentres in sequence

Molecular recognition plays a key role in enzyme-substrate specificity, the regulation of genes, and the treatment of diseases. Inspired by the power of molecular recognition in enzymatic processes, we sought to exploit its use in organic synthesis. Here we demonstrate how a synthetic rhodium-based catalyst can selectively bind a dehydroamino acid residue to initiate a sequential and stereoselective synthesis of cyclic peptides. Our combined experimental and theoretical study reveals the underpinnings of a cascade reduction that occurs with high stereocontrol and in one direction around a macrocyclic ring. As the catalyst can dissociate from the peptide, the C to N directionality of the hydrogenation reactions is controlled by catalyst–substrate recognition rather than a processive mechanism in which the catalyst remains bound to the macrocycle. This mechanistic insight provides a foundation for the use of cascade hydrogenations. A simple amino acid can be recognized by a synthetic catalyst in a process that initiates the sequential reduction of cyclic dehydropeptides. An experimental and theoretical study provides evidence for a unique mechanism that involves unidirectional reduction to set four stereocentres around a macrocyclic ring.

Title: 
Photoacoustic imaging of elevated glutathione in models of lung cancer for companion diagnostic applications

Companion diagnostics (CDx) are powerful tests that can provide physicians with crucial biomarker information that can improve treatment outcomes by matching therapies to patients. Here, we report a photoacoustic imaging-based CDx (PACDx) for the selective detection of elevated glutathione (GSH) in a lung cancer model. GSH is abundant in most cells, so we adopted a physical organic chemistry approach to precisely tune the reactivity to distinguish between normal and pathological states. To evaluate the efficacy of PACDx in vivo, we designed a blind study where photoacoustic imaging was used to identify mice bearing lung xenografts. We also employed PACDx in orthotopic lung cancer and liver metastasis models to image GSH. In addition, we designed a matching prodrug, PARx, that uses the same SNAr chemistry to release a chemotherapeutic with an integrated PA readout. Studies demonstrate that PARx can inhibit tumour growth without off-target toxicity in a lung cancer xenograft model. Imaging-based companion diagnostics can provide real-time information to match therapies to patients; however, glutathione is abundant in most cells, making it an unlikely candidate for companion diagnosis. Now, a chemical probe has been developed that can detect elevated glutathione concentrations via photoacoustic imaging. Using this probe enables normal and pathological states in a lung cancer model to be distinguished.

Identifying the components of the solid–electrolyte interphase in Li-ion batteries

The importance of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) for reversible operation of Li-ion batteries has been well established, but the understanding of its chemistry remains incomplete. The current consensus on the identity of the major organic SEI component is that it consists of lithium ethylene di-carbonate (LEDC), which is thought to have high Li-ion conductivity, but low electronic conductivity (to protect the Li/C electrode). Here, we report on the synthesis and structural and spectroscopic characterizations of authentic LEDC and lithium ethylene mono-carbonate (LEMC). Direct comparisons of the SEI grown on graphite anodes suggest that LEMC, instead of LEDC, is likely to be the major SEI component. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies on LEMC and lithium methyl carbonate (LMC) reveal unusual layered structures and Li+ coordination environments. LEMC has Li+ conductivities of &gt;1 × 10−6 S cm−1, while LEDC is almost an ionic insulator. The complex interconversions and equilibria of LMC, LEMC and LEDC in dimethyl sulfoxide solutions are also investigated. The solid–electrolyte-interphase layer is extremely important for reversible electrochemical cycling of Li-ion batteries. Now it has been observed that lithium ethylene mono-carbonate, instead of the previously reported lithium ethylene di-carbonate, is the major initial organic species in this layer and it has a high Li-ion conductivity.

Title: 
A dual transacylation mechanism for polyketide synthase chain release in enacyloxin antibiotic biosynthesis

Polyketide synthases assemble diverse natural products with numerous important applications. The thioester intermediates in polyketide assembly are covalently tethered to acyl carrier protein domains of the synthase. Several mechanisms for polyketide chain release are known, contributing to natural product structural diversification. Here, we report a dual transacylation mechanism for chain release from the enacyloxin polyketide synthase, which assembles an antibiotic with promising activity against Acinetobacter baumannii. A non-elongating ketosynthase domain transfers the polyketide chain from the final acyl carrier protein domain of the synthase to a separate carrier protein, and a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase condensation domain condenses it with (1S,3R,4S)-3,4-dihydroxycyclohexane carboxylic acid. Molecular dissection of this process reveals that non-elongating ketosynthase domain-mediated transacylation circumvents the inability of the condensation domain to recognize the acyl carrier protein domain. Several 3,4-dihydroxycyclohexane carboxylic acid analogues can be employed for chain release, suggesting a promising strategy for producing enacyloxin analogues. Enacyloxin IIa is an antibiotic, assembled by a modular polyketide synthase, with promising activity against the Gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii. Now, it has been shown that the enacyloxin IIa polyketide chain is released via transfer to a separately encoded carrier protein by a non-elongating ketosynthase domain, followed by condensation with 3,4-dihydroxycyclohexane carboxylic acid by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase condensation domain.

A proteome-wide atlas of lysine-reactive chemistry

Recent advances in chemical proteomics have begun to characterize the reactivity and ligandability of lysines on a global scale. Yet, only a limited diversity of aminophilic electrophiles have been evaluated for interactions with the lysine proteome. Here, we report an in-depth profiling of &gt;30 uncharted aminophilic chemotypes that greatly expands the content of ligandable lysines in human proteins. Aminophilic electrophiles showed disparate proteomic reactivities that range from selective interactions with a handful of lysines to, for a set of dicarboxaldehyde fragments, remarkably broad engagement of the covalent small-molecule–lysine interactions captured by the entire library. We used these latter ‘scout’ electrophiles to efficiently map ligandable lysines in primary human immune cells under stimulatory conditions. Finally, we show that aminophilic compounds perturb diverse biochemical functions through site-selective modification of lysines in proteins, including protein–RNA interactions implicated in innate immune responses. These findings support the broad potential of covalent chemistry for targeting functional lysines in the human proteome. A deep chemical proteomic investigation of diverse aminophilic electrophiles has identified ligandable lysines across a wide range of human proteins. The proteins cover different functional and structural classes, and the aminophilic electrophiles include compounds that disrupt protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions. This dataset provides a proteome-wide atlas of lysine-reactive chemistry.

E- and Z-trisubstituted macrocyclic alkenes for natural product synthesis and skeletal editing

Many therapeutic agents are macrocyclic trisubstituted alkenes but preparation of these structures is typically inefficient and non-selective. A possible solution would entail catalytic macrocyclic ring-closing metathesis, but these transformations require high catalyst loading, conformationally rigid precursors and are often low yielding and/or non-stereoselective. Here we introduce a ring-closing metathesis strategy for synthesis of trisubstituted macrocyclic olefins in either stereoisomeric form, regardless of the level of entropic assistance. The goal was achieved by addressing several unexpected difficulties, including complications arising from pre-ring-closing metathesis alkene isomerization. The power of the method is highlighted by two examples. The first is the near-complete reversal of substrate-controlled selectivity in the formation of a macrolactam related to an antifungal natural product. The other is a late-stage stereoselective generation of an E-trisubstituted alkene in a 24-membered ring, en route to the cytotoxic natural product dolabelide C. Many bioactive compounds are trisubstituted macrocyclic alkenes, but use of current methods often results in poor yields and low stereoselectivity. Now, a ring-closing metathesis strategy has been developed that enables these compounds to be prepared efficiently and in either stereoisomeric form: an approach that may prove useful in the late stages of total syntheses, for skeletal editing and in drug discovery.

Title: 
Emergence of low-symmetry foldamers from single monomers

Self-assembly is a powerful method to obtain large discrete functional molecular architectures. When using a single building block, self-assembly generally yields symmetrical objects in which all the subunits relate similarly to their neighbours. Here we report the discovery of a family of self-constructing cyclic macromolecules with stable folded conformations of low symmetry, which include some with a prime number (13, 17 and 23) of units, despite being formed from a single component. The formation of these objects amounts to the production of polymers with a perfectly uniform length. Design rules for the spontaneous emergence of such macromolecules include endowing monomers with a strong potential for non-covalent interactions that remain frustrated in competing entropically favoured yet conformationally restrained smaller cycles. The process can also be templated by a guest molecule that itself has an asymmetrical structure, which paves the way to molecular imprinting techniques at the level of single polymer chains. The majority of discrete structures obtained by self-assembly possess high symmetry, and thus low complexity: all subunits relate to their neighbours in a similar manner. Now, the spontaneous formation of complex low-symmetry assemblies produced from a single building block has been demonstrated using a systems chemistry approach. The single building block oligomerizes to form specific homomeric cyclic macromolecules that adopt a folded conformation.

Understanding metal synergy in heterodinuclear catalysts for the copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides

Carbon dioxide and epoxide copolymerization is an industrially relevant means to valorize waste and improve sustainability in polymer manufacturing. Given the value of the polymer products—polycarbonates or polyether carbonates—it could provide an economic stimulus to capture and storage technologies. The process efficiency depends upon the catalyst, and previously Zn(ii)Mg(ii) heterodinuclear catalysts showed good performances at low carbon dioxide pressures, attributed to synergic interactions between the metals. Now, a Mg(ii)Co(ii) catalyst is reported that exhibits significantly better activity (turnover frequency &gt; 12,000 h−1) and high selectivity (&gt;99% CO2 utilization and polycarbonate selectivity) for carbon dioxide and cyclohexene oxide copolymerization. Detailed kinetic investigations show a second-order rate law, independent of CO2 pressure from 1–40 bar, to produce polyols. Kinetic data also reveal that synergy arises from differentiated roles for the metals in the mechanism: epoxide coordination occurs at Mg(ii), with reduced transition state entropy, while the Co(ii) centre accelerates carbonate attack by lowering the transition state enthalpy. This rare insight into intermetallic synergy rationalizes the outstanding catalytic performance and provides a new feature to exploit in other homogeneous catalyses. The copolymerization of CO2 with epoxides is an attractive approach for valorizing waste products and improving sustainability in polymer manufacturing. Now, a heterodinuclear Mg(ii)Co(ii) complex has been shown to act as a highly active and selective catalyst for this reaction at low CO2 pressure. The synergy between the two metals was investigated using polymerization kinetics.

Ethylene/ethane separation in a stable hydrogen-bonded organic framework through a gating mechanism

Porous materials are very promising for the development of cost- and energy-efficient separation processes, such as for the purification of ethylene from ethylene/ethane mixture—an important but currently challenging industrial process. Here we report a microporous hydrogen-bonded organic framework that takes up ethylene with very good selectivity over ethane through a gating mechanism. The material consists of tetracyano-bicarbazole building blocks held together through intermolecular CN···H–C hydrogen bonding interactions, and forms as a threefold-interpenetrated framework with pores of suitable size for the selective capture of ethylene. The hydrogen-bonded organic framework exhibits a gating mechanism in which the threshold pressure required for guest uptake varies with the temperature. Ethylene/ethane separation is validated by breakthrough experiments with high purity of ethylene (99.1%) at 333 K. Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks are usually not robust, yet this material was stable under harsh conditions, including exposure to strong acidity, basicity and a variety of highly polar solvents. Porous materials are promising candidates for the cost- and energy-efficient separation of ethylene and ethane from gas mixtures: an important but challenging industrial process. Now, a hydrogen-bonded organic framework has been reported that is stable under harsh conditions and can take up ethylene at practical temperatures—with very high selectivity over ethane—through a gating mechanism.

Machine learning overcomes human bias in the discovery of self-assembling peptides

Peptide materials have a wide array of functions, from tissue engineering and surface coatings to catalysis and sensing. Tuning the sequence of amino acids that comprise the peptide modulates peptide functionality, but a small increase in sequence length leads to a dramatic increase in the number of peptide candidates. Traditionally, peptide design is guided by human expertise and intuition and typically yields fewer than ten peptides per study, but these approaches are not easily scalable and are susceptible to human bias. Here we introduce a machine learning workflow—AI-expert—that combines Monte Carlo tree search and random forest with molecular dynamics simulations to develop a fully autonomous computational search engine to discover peptide sequences with high potential for self-assembly. We demonstrate the efficacy of the AI-expert to efficiently search large spaces of tripeptides and pentapeptides. The predictability of AI-expert performs on par or better than our human experts and suggests several non-intuitive sequences with high self-assembly propensity, outlining its potential to overcome human bias and accelerate peptide discovery. Peptide design remains a challenge owing to the large library of amino acids. Rational design approaches, although successful, result in a peptide design bias. Now it has been shown that AI techniques can be used to overcome such bias and discover unusual peptides as efficiently as humans.

Adaptive response of a metal–organic framework through reversible disorder–disorder transitions

The ultrahigh porosity and varied functionalities of porous metal–organic frameworks make them excellent candidates for applications that range widely from gas storage and separation to catalysis and sensing. An interesting feature of some frameworks is the ability to open their pores to a specific guest, enabling highly selective separation. A prerequisite for this is bistability of the host structure, which enables the framework to breathe, that is, to switch between two stability minima in response to its environment. Here we describe a porous framework DUT-8(Ni)—which consists of nickel paddle wheel clusters and carboxylate linkers—that adopts a configurationally degenerate family of disordered states in the presence of specific guests. This disorder originates from the nonlinear linkers arranging the clusters in closed loops of different local symmetries that in turn propagate as complex tilings. Solvent exchange stimulates the formation of distinct disordered frameworks, as demonstrated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and diffraction techniques. Guest exchange was shown to stimulate repeatable switching transitions between distinct disorder states. Some flexible metal–organic frameworks are known to exhibit an adaptive behaviour as they convert between two stable forms in response to their environment. Now, a metal–organic framework based on nonlinear linkers has been shown to adopt a much more complex family of degenerate disordered configurations, which can be reversibly interconverted through guest exchange.

Distal conformational locks on ferrocene mechanophores guide reaction pathways for increased mechanochemical reactivity

Mechanophores can be used to produce strain-dependent covalent chemical responses in polymeric materials, including stress strengthening, stress sensing and network remodelling. In general, it is desirable for mechanophores to be inert in the absence of force but highly reactive under applied tension. Metallocenes possess potentially useful combinations of force-free stability and force-coupled reactivity, but the mechanistic basis of this reactivity remains largely unexplored. Here, we have used single-molecule force spectroscopy to show that the mechanical reactivities of a series of ferrocenophanes are not correlated with ring strain in the reactants, but with the extent of rotational alignment of their two cyclopentadienyl ligands. Distal attachments can be used to restrict the mechanism of ferrocene dissociation to proceed through ligand ‘peeling’, as opposed to the more conventional ’shearing’ mechanism of the parent ferrocene, leading the dissociation rate constant to increase by several orders of magnitude at forces of ~1 nN. It also leads to improved macroscopic, multi-responsive behaviour, including mechanochromism and force-induced cross-linking in ferrocenophane-containing polymers. Metallocenes are attractive mechanophores because they are stable in the absence of force, yet reactive under tension. Now, covalently bridging the two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands of ferrocenes embedded in a polymer has been shown to alter their mechanochemical reactivity, leading to a faster dissociation of the Fe–Cp bond, which occurs through a peeling mechanism rather than a shearing one.

Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation by synthetic catalysts in cancer cells

Catalytic anticancer metallodrugs active at low doses could minimize side-effects, introduce novel mechanisms of action that combat resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer-drug activity. Here we use highly stable chiral half-sandwich organometallic Os(II) arene sulfonyl diamine complexes, [Os(arene)(TsDPEN)] (TsDPEN, N-(p-toluenesulfonyl)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine), to achieve a highly enantioselective reduction of pyruvate, a key intermediate in metabolic pathways. Reduction is shown both in aqueous model systems and in human cancer cells, with non-toxic concentrations of sodium formate used as a hydride source. The catalytic mechanism generates selectivity towards ovarian cancer cells versus non-cancerous fibroblasts (both ovarian and lung), which are commonly used as models of healthy proliferating cells. The formate precursor N-formylmethionine was explored as an alternative to formate in PC3 prostate cancer cells, which are known to overexpress a deformylase enzyme. Transfer-hydrogenation catalysts that generate reductive stress in cancer cells offer a new approach to cancer therapy. Intracellular asymmetric transfer hydrogenation catalysis using Os(II) complexes has now been demonstrated and offers a new approach for selectively killing cancer cells. Enantiomers of Os(II) arene catalysts can penetrate cell membranes enabling the reduction of pyruvate to D- or L-lactate using formate as a hydride source, with high enantioselectivity.

Spatiotemporal and global profiling of DNA–protein interactions enables discovery of low-affinity transcription factors

Precise dissection of DNA–protein interactions is essential for elucidating the recognition basis, dynamics and gene regulation mechanism. However, global profiling of weak and dynamic DNA–protein interactions remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we establish the light-induced lysine (K) enabled crosslinking (LIKE-XL) strategy for spatiotemporal and global profiling of DNA–protein interactions. Harnessing unique abilities to capture weak and transient DNA–protein interactions, we demonstrate that LIKE-XL enables the discovery of low-affinity transcription-factor/DNA interactions via sequence-specific DNA baits, determining the binding sites for transcription factors that have been previously unknown. More importantly, we successfully decipher the dynamics of the transcription factor subproteome in response to drug treatment in a time-resolved manner, and find downstream target transcription factors from drug perturbations, providing insight into their dynamic transcriptional networks. The LIKE-XL strategy offers a complementary method to expand the DNA–protein profiling toolbox and map accurate DNA–protein interactomes that were previously inaccessible via non-covalent strategies, for better understanding of protein function in health and disease. Precise analysis of DNA–protein interactions can help to better understand various biological processes. Now, the ‘light-induced lysine (K) enabled crosslinking’ strategy (shortened to ‘LIKE-XL’) has been developed for spatiotemporal and global profiling of DNA–protein interactions, affording the discovery of low-affinity interactions between transcription factors and DNA using sequence-specific DNA baits.

Hydrogen atom collisions with a semiconductor efficiently promote electrons to the conduction band

The Born–Oppenheimer approximation is the keystone of modern computational chemistry and there is wide interest in understanding under what conditions it remains valid. Hydrogen atom scattering from insulator, semi-metal and metal surfaces has helped provide such information. The approximation is adequate for insulators and for metals it fails, but not severely. Here we present hydrogen atom scattering from a semiconductor surface: Ge(111)c(2 × 8). Experiments show bimodal energy-loss distributions revealing two channels. Molecular dynamics trajectories within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation reproduce one channel quantitatively. The second channel transfers much more energy and is absent in simulations. It grows with hydrogen atom incidence energy and exhibits an energy-loss onset equal to the Ge surface bandgap. This leads us to conclude that hydrogen atom collisions at the surface of a semiconductor are capable of promoting electrons from the valence to the conduction band with high efficiency. Our current understanding fails to explain these observations. Inelastic hydrogen atom scattering from surfaces provides a good benchmark for the validity of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation in surface chemistry. Now it has been shown that hydrogen atoms colliding with a semiconductor surface can efficiently excite electrons above the surface bandgap, representing a clear example of the failure of the approximation.

Arene radiofluorination enabled by photoredox-mediated halide interconversion

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful imaging technology that can visualize and measure metabolic processes in vivo and/or obtain unique information about drug candidates. The identification of new and improved molecular probes plays a critical role in PET, but its progress is somewhat limited due to the lack of efficient and simple labelling methods to modify biologically active small molecules and/or drugs. Current methods to radiofluorinate unactivated arenes are still relatively limited, especially in a simple and site-selective way. Here we disclose a method for constructing C–18F bonds through direct halide/18F conversion in electron-rich halo(hetero)arenes. [18F]F− is introduced into a broad spectrum of readily available aryl halide precursors in a site-selective manner under mild photoredox conditions. Notably, our direct 19F/18F exchange method enables rapid PET probe diversification through the preparation and evaluation of an [18F]-labelled O-methyl tyrosine library. This strategy also results in the high-yielding synthesis of the widely used PET agent l-[18F]FDOPA from a readily available l-FDOPA analogue. A photoredox-mediated SNAr reaction has now been developed for the direct radiofluorination of unactivated aryl halides. A series of arenes can be radiofluorinated in a site-selective manner from readily available aryl halide precursors under mild conditions. This strategy allows efficient 19F/18F isotopic exchange, enabling rapid PET probe diversification and clinical tracer preparation.

Co-precipitation behaviour of single atoms of rutherfordium in basic solutions

All superheavy elements (SHEs), with atomic numbers (Z) ≥104, have been artificially synthesized one atom at a time and their chemical properties are largely unknown. Because these heavy nuclei have short lifetimes as well as extremely low production rates, chemical experiments need to be carried out on single atoms and have mostly been limited to adsorption and extraction. We have now investigated the precipitation properties of the SHE Rf (Z = 104). A co-precipitation method with samarium hydroxide had previously established that the co-precipitation behaviour of a range of elements reflected these elements’ tendency to form hydroxide precipitates and/or ammine complex ions. Here we investigated co-precipitation of Rf in basic solutions containing NH3 or NaOH. Comparisons between the behaviour of Rf with that of Zr and Hf (lighter homologues of Rf) and actinide Th (a pseudo-homologue of Rf) showed that Rf does not coordinate strongly with NH3, but forms a hydroxide (co)precipitate that is expected to be Rf(OH)4. It is difficult to investigate the chemical properties of superheavy elements, which are only available an atom at a time and rapidly decay. A co-precipitation method with samarium has now been developed that suggests rutherfordium would form hydroxide precipitates—but not ammine ones—if it were possible to perform these experiments on macroscopic quantities.

Global aromaticity at the nanoscale

Aromaticity can be defined by the ability of a molecule to sustain a ring current when placed in a magnetic field. Hückel’s rule states that molecular rings with [4n + 2] π-electrons are aromatic, with an induced magnetization that opposes the external field inside the ring, whereas those with 4n π-electrons are antiaromatic, with the opposite magnetization. This rule reliably predicts the behaviour of small molecules, typically with fewer than 22 π-electrons (n = 5). It is not clear whether aromaticity has a size limit, or whether Hückel’s rule extends to much larger macrocycles. Here, we present evidence for global aromaticity in porphyrin nanorings with circuits of up to 162 π-electrons (n = 40); aromaticity is controlled by changing the constitution, oxidation state and conformation. Whenever a ring current is observed, its direction is correctly predicted by Hückel’s rule. The largest ring currents occur when the porphyrin units have fractional oxidation states. Does aromaticity have a size limit? Evidence is presented for global aromaticity in porphyrin nanorings with circuits of up to 162 π-electrons. The conformation of the nanoring can be altered by changing the template, which in turn controls the aromaticity. Whenever a ring current is observed, its direction is correctly predicted by Hückel’s rule.

Multilayer stacks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) show promise for applications in functional devices such as organic photovoltaics and field-effect transistors, but, although nanometre-sized PAHs—often referred to as nanographenes—have been well investigated as single-layer molecules, their multilayer counterparts remain rather unexplored. Here we show the assembly of a C64 nanographene derivative (comprising a planar core decorated with four meta-terphenyl–imide moieties at its periphery) into multilayer stacks with smaller PAHs ranging from naphthalene to ovalene and hexabenzocoronene. The functionalized C64 nanographene serves as a ditopic host that can accommodate a smaller PAH on either side of its planar core, in cavities delimited by its bulky imide substituents. Bilayers and trilayers (that is, complexes with 1:1 and 1:2 host:guest ratios, respectively) were observed in solution, and dimers of these complexes as well as multilayer compounds were isolated in the solid state. Quantum-chemical calculations indicate that dispersion forces are the main stabilizing factor for these complexes. Nanometre-sized polyaromatic hydrocarbons (nanographenes) have been largely explored as single-layer systems. Now a C64 nanographene comprising a planar core decorated with four terphenyl–imide moieties at its periphery has been shown to assemble with coronene to form bi- and trilayer host–guest complexes in solution, as well as tetra-, hexa- and multilayer stacks in the crystalline state.

Efficient and tunable one-dimensional charge transport in layered lanthanide metal–organic frameworks

The emergence of electrically conductive metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has led to applications in chemical sensing and electrical energy storage, among others. The most conductive MOFs are made from organic ligands and square-planar transition metal ions connected into two-dimensional (2D) sheets stacked on top of each other. Their electrical properties are thought to depend critically on the covalency of the metal–ligand bond, and less importance is given to out-of-plane charge transport. Here, we report a series of lanthanide-based MOFs that allow fine tuning of the sheet stacking. In these materials, the Ln3+ ions lie between the planes of the ligands, thus connecting organic layers into a 3D framework through lanthanide–oxygen chains. Here, efficient charge transport is found to occur primarily perpendicular to the 2D sheets. These results demonstrate that high conductivity in layered MOFs does not necessarily require a metal–ligand bond with highly covalent character, and that interactions between organic ligands alone can produce efficient charge transport pathways. High electrical conductivities in metal–organic frameworks—attractive for applications in sensing and energy storage—typically arise in layered MOFs from metal–ligand bonds with strong covalent character. Now, lanthanide-based MOFs have shown high out-of-plane conductivities originating instead from the π-stacking of organic ligands.

D3+ formation through photoionization of the molecular D2–D2 dimer

The H2–H2 molecular dimer is of fundamental importance in the study of chemical interactions because of its unique bonding properties and its ability to model more complex systems. The trihydrogen cation H3+ is also a key intermediate in a range of chemical processes in interstellar environments, such as the formation of various organic molecules and early stars. However, the unexpected high abundance of H3+ in molecular clouds remains challenging to explain. Here using near-infrared, femtosecond laser pulses and coincidence momentum imaging, we find that the dominant channel after photoionization of a deuterium molecular dimer (D2–D2) is the ejection of a deuterium atom within a few hundred femtoseconds, leading to the formation of D3+. The formation mechanism is supported and well-reproduced by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. This pathway of D3+ formation from ultracold D2–D2 gas may provide insights into the high abundance of H3+ in the interstellar medium. Trihydrogen cations are abundant in interstellar space and play a vital role in both star and organic molecule formation. Now it has been shown that D3+ cations can be directly produced through photoionization of molecular D2–D2 dimers.

Autonomous and directional flow of water and transport of particles across a subliming dynamic crystal surface

Chemical and morphological traits of natural substrates that can propel and transport fluids over their surfaces have long provided inspiration for the engineering of artificial materials that can harvest and collect water from aerial humidity. Here we report that the gradual widening of parallel microchannels on a surface of a slowly subliming hexachlorobenzene crystal can promote the autonomous and bidirectional transduction of condensed aerial water. Driven by topology changes on the surface of the crystal and water exchange with the gas phase, droplets of condensed water migrate over the crystal. These droplets are also able to transport silver particles and other particulate matter, such as dust. The velocity of the particles was shown to be dependent on both the sublimation rate of the crystal and the relative humidity of its environment. This example of a sublimation-powered water flow demonstrates that topological surface changes accompanying crystal phase transitions can be harnessed to transport liquid and solid matter over surfaces. Crystals of hexachlorobenzene have now been shown to support the autonomous motion of water and particulate matter over their surface. Parallel microchannels present at the surface of the crystal gradually widen by sublimation, propelling droplets of condensed ambient water that can also transport microscopic amounts of material such as silver microparticles.

Tracking the ultraviolet-induced photochemistry of thiophenone during and after ultrafast ring opening

Photoinduced isomerization reactions lie at the heart of many chemical processes in nature. The mechanisms of such reactions are determined by a delicate interplay of coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics occurring on the femtosecond scale, followed by the slower redistribution of energy into different vibrational degrees of freedom. Here we apply time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with a seeded extreme ultraviolet free-electron laser to trace the ultrafast ring opening of gas-phase thiophenone molecules following ultraviolet photoexcitation. When combined with ab initio electronic structure and molecular dynamics calculations of the excited- and ground-state molecules, the results provide insights into both the electronic and nuclear dynamics of this fundamental class of reactions. The initial ring opening and non-adiabatic coupling to the electronic ground state are shown to be driven by ballistic S–C bond extension and to be complete within 350 fs. Theory and experiment also enable visualization of the rich ground-state dynamics that involve the formation of, and interconversion between, ring-opened isomers and the cyclic structure, as well as fragmentation over much longer timescales. Photoinduced isomerization reactions, including ring-opening reactions, lie at the heart of many chemical processes in nature. The pathway and dynamics of the ring opening of a model heterocycle have now been investigated by femtosecond photoelectron spectroscopy combined with ab initio theory, enabling the visualization of rich dynamics in both the ground and excited electronic states.

The formation of all-cis-(multi)fluorinated piperidines by a dearomatization–hydrogenation process

Piperidines and fluorine substituents are both independently indispensable components in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Logically, the incorporation of fluorine atoms into piperidine scaffolds is therefore an area of tremendous potential. However, synthetic approaches towards the formation of these architectures are often impractical. The diastereoselective synthesis of substituted monofluorinated piperidines often requires substrates with pre-defined stereochemistry. That of multifluorinated piperidines is even more challenging, and often needs to be carried out in multistep syntheses. In this report, we describe a straightforward process for the one-pot rhodium-catalysed dearomatization–hydrogenation of fluoropyridine precursors. This strategy enables the formation of a plethora of substituted all-cis-(multi)fluorinated piperidines in a highly diastereoselective fashion through pyridine dearomatization followed by complete saturation of the resulting intermediates by hydrogenation. Fluorinated piperidines with defined axial/equatorial orientation of fluorine substituents were successfully applied in the preparation of commercial drugs analogues. Additionally, fluorinated PipPhos as well as fluorinated ionic liquids were obtained by this dearomatization–hydrogenation process. Despite their huge potential in medicinal chemistry, current approaches for the synthesis of fluorinated piperidines are often impractical. A straightforward process for the rhodium-catalysed dearomatization–hydrogenation of fluoropyridines has now been described. This strategy enables the highly diastereoselective formation of a variety of all-cis-(multi)fluorinated piperidines and the study of their conformational behaviour.

Cyclization of peptides with two chemical bridges affords large scaffold diversities

Successful screening campaigns depend on large and structurally diverse collections of compounds. In macrocycle screening, variation of the molecular scaffold is important for structural diversity, but so far it has been challenging to diversify this aspect in large combinatorial libraries. Here, we report the cyclization of peptides with two chemical bridges to provide rapid access to thousands of different macrocyclic scaffolds in libraries that are easy to synthesize, screen and decode. Application of this strategy to phage-encoded libraries allowed for the screening of an unprecedented structural diversity of macrocycles against plasma kallikrein, which is important in the swelling disorder hereditary angioedema. These libraries yielded inhibitors with remarkable binding properties (subnanomolar Ki, &gt;1,000-fold selectivity) despite the small molecular mass (~1,200 Da). An interlaced bridge format characteristic of this strategy provided high proteolytic stability (t1/2 in plasma of &gt;3 days), making double-bridged peptides potentially amenable to topical or oral delivery. Crosslinking within peptides containing two pairs of cysteines to form chemical bridges has now been shown to provide rapid access to thousands of different macrocyclic scaffolds in libraries that are easy to synthesize, screen and decode. Applying this strategy to phage-encoded libraries yielded binders with remarkable affinities despite the small molecular mass.

Tunable and recyclable polyesters from CO2 and butadiene

Carbon dioxide is inexpensive and abundant, and its prevalence as waste makes it attractive as a sustainable chemical feedstock. Although there are examples of copolymerizations of CO2 with high-energy monomers, the direct copolymerization of CO2 with olefins has not been reported. Here an alternative route to functionalizable, recyclable polyesters derived from CO2, butadiene and hydrogen via an intermediary lactone, 3-ethyl-6-vinyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, is described. Catalytic ring-opening polymerization of the lactone by 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene yields polyesters with molar masses up to 13.6 kg mol−1 and pendent vinyl side chains that can undergo post-polymerization functionalization. The polymer has a low ceiling temperature of 138 °C, allowing for facile chemical recycling, and is inherently biodegradable under aerobic aqueous conditions (OECD-301B protocol). These results show that a well-defined polyester can be derived from CO2, olefins and hydrogen, expanding access to new polymer feedstocks that were once considered unfeasible. The direct copolymerization of carbon dioxide and commodity olefins has been a long-standing challenge in polymer science. Now, an indirect approach has been developed in which hydrogenated disubstituted valerolactones derived from telomerization of CO2 and butadiene can undergo ring-opening polymerization, yielding chemically recyclable and degradable aliphatic polyesters with high CO2 content.

Pathogenic bacteria remodel central metabolic enzyme to build a cyclopropanol warhead

Bacteria of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group pose a global health threat, causing the infectious diseases melioidosis, a common cause of pneumonia and sepsis, and glanders, a contagious zoonosis. A trait of BP bacteria is a conserved gene cluster coding for the biosynthesis of polyketides (malleicyprols) with a reactive cyclopropanol unit that is critical for virulence. Enzymes building this warhead represent ideal targets for antivirulence strategies but the biochemical basis of cyclopropanol formation is unknown. Here we describe the formation of the malleicyprol warhead. We show that BurG, an unusual NAD+-dependent member of the ketol-acid reductoisomerase family, constructs the strained cyclopropanol ring. Biochemical assays and a suite of eight crystal structures of native and mutated BurG with bound analogues and inhibitors provide snapshots of each step of the complex reaction mechanism, involving a concealed oxidoreduction and a C–S bond cleavage. Our findings illustrate a remarkable case of neofunctionalisation, where a biocatalyst from central metabolism has been evolutionarily repurposed for warhead production in pathogens. Burkholderia pseudomallei is a species of bacteria that poses a global health threat and, more generally, bacteria of the Burkholderia pseudomallei group cause severe diseases that are recalcitrant to treatment with antibiotics. Now, it has been shown how these infamous pathogens repurpose the widespread enzyme BurG to produce a reactive cyclopropanol head group found in the virulence-promoting malleicyprol toxins. Interrupting the synthesis of the cyclopropanol warhead is a potential route for developing antivirulence treatments.

Fermi-phase-induced interference in the reaction between Cl and vibrationally excited CH3D

Mode selectivity is a well-established concept in chemical dynamics. A polyatomic molecule possesses multiple vibrational modes and the mechanical couplings between them can result in complicated anharmonic motions that defy a simple oscillatory description. A prototypical example of this is Fermi-coupled vibration, in which an energy-split eigenstate executes coherent nuclear motion that is comprised of the constituent normal modes with distinctive phases. Will this vibrational phase affect chemical reactivity? How can this phase effect be disentangled from more classical amplitude effects? Here, to address these questions, we study the reaction of Cl with a pair of Fermi states of CH3D(v1-I and v1-II). We find that the reactivity ratio of (v1-I)/(v1-II) in forming the CH2D(v = 0) + HCl(v) products deviates significantly from that permitted by the conventional reactivity-borrowing framework. Based on a proposed metric, this discrepancy can only be explained when the scattering interferences mediated by the CH3D vibrational phases are explicitly considered, which expands the concept of vibrational control of chemical reactivity into the quantum regime. Influencing the products of a reaction through controlling the state of the reactants is a notable goal for chemists. It has now been shown that the reactivity of a pair of Fermi-coupled vibrational states of CH3D(v1-I and v1-II) with a chlorine atom depends not only on the constituent basis modes, but also on the relative phase of the two modes in their wave-functions.

Organocatalytic asymmetric deoxygenation of sulfones to access chiral sulfinyl compounds

Over the past decades, many efficient methodologies have been developed that allow for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral sulfinyl compounds. However, the enantioselective deoxygenation of hexavalent sulfones for the formation of chiral sulfinyl compounds still remains one of the major challenges in the fields of asymmetric synthesis and organosulfur chemistry. Here we have demonstrated that a synergistic combination of organocatalysis and the incorporation of a cyano group into the sulfone generates a chiral sulfinic species as an active intermediate. A wide range of chiral sulfinates with high enantioselectivities could then be acquired using alcohols as nucleophiles, and the subsequent transformations allowed the collective preparation of a variety of chiral sulfinyl compounds. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the catalytic cycle involves a quinuclidine-assisted stepwise 1,2-cyano group transfer, base-assisted intermolecular substitution with alcohol and regeneration of the active catalyst. The enantioselectivity was determined by the cyano migration step. The direct conversion of sulfones to chiral sulfinyl compounds is one of the major challenges in the fields of asymmetric synthesis and organosulfur chemistry. Now, through incorporation of a cyano group into the sulfone, an organocatalytic asymmetric deoxygenation strategy has been developed that enables the synthesis of chiral sulfinyl compounds.

One-pot, room-temperature conversion of dinitrogen to ammonium chloride at a main-group element

The industrial reduction of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia is an energy-intensive process that consumes a considerable proportion of the global energy supply. As a consequence, species that can bind N2 and cleave its strong N–N bond under mild conditions have been sought for decades. Until recently, the only species known to support N2 fixation and functionalization were based on a handful of metals of the s and d blocks of the periodic table. Here we present one-pot binding, cleavage and reduction of N2 to ammonium by a main-group species. The reaction—a complex multiple reduction–protonation sequence—proceeds at room temperature in a single synthetic step through the use of solid-phase reductant and acid reagents. A simple acid quench of the mixture then provides ammonium, the protonated form of ammonia present in fertilizer. The elementary reaction steps in the process are elucidated, including the crucial N–N bond cleavage process, and all of the intermediates of the reaction are isolated. The vast majority of species capable of converting dinitrogen to ammonia rely on transition metals. Now, a boron compound has been shown to mediate the one-pot binding, cleavage and reduction of N2 to ammonium salts under mild conditions through a complex cascade mechanism involving multiple reduction–protonation sequences.

Catalytic living ring-opening metathesis polymerization with Grubbs’ second- and third-generation catalysts

In a conventional living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), an equal number of ruthenium complexes to the number of polymer chains synthesized are required. This can lead to high loadings of ruthenium complexes when aiming for shorter polymers. Here, a reversible chain-transfer agent was used to produce living ROMP polymers from norbornene derivatives using catalytic amounts of Grubbs’ ruthenium complexes. The polymers obtained by this method showed all of the characteristics of a living polymerization (that is, good molecular weight control, narrow molecular weight dispersities and the ability to form block copolymers). Monomers carrying functional moieties such as ferrocene, coumarin or a triisopropylsilyl-protected primary alcohol could also be catalytically polymerized in a living fashion. The method presented follows a degenerative chain-transfer process and is more economical and environmentally friendly compared with previous living ROMP procedures as it utilizes only catalytic amounts of costly and toxic ruthenium complexes. In a ruthenium-catalysed living ring-opening metathesis polymerization, one metal centre is required for each polymer chain, and this requires high catalyst loadings when aiming for short polymer chains. Now, it has been shown that a degenerative reversible chain-transfer process enables the synthesis of ring-opened metathesis polymers with controlled molecular weight, using only catalytic amounts of a ruthenium complex.

Dual-function enzyme catalysis for enantioselective carbon–nitrogen bond formation

Chiral amines can be made by insertion of a carbene into an N–H bond using two-catalyst systems that combine a transition metal-based carbene-transfer catalyst and a chiral proton-transfer catalyst to enforce stereocontrol. Haem proteins can effect carbene N–H insertion, but asymmetric protonation in an active site replete with proton sources is challenging. Here we describe engineered cytochrome P450 enzymes that catalyse carbene N–H insertion to prepare biologically relevant α-amino lactones with high activity and enantioselectivity (up to 32,100 total turnovers, &gt;99% yield and 98% e.e.). These enzymes serve as dual-function catalysts, inducing carbene transfer and promoting the subsequent proton transfer with excellent stereoselectivity in a single active site. Computational studies uncover the detailed mechanism of this new-to-nature enzymatic reaction and explain how active-site residues accelerate this transformation and provide stereocontrol. A haem protein that serves as a dual-function catalyst capable of inserting a carbene into a N–H bond to form α-amino lactones has been reported. The enzyme catalyses both carbene transfer and the subsequent proton transfer in a single active site. This transformation can proceed at the gram scale with high efficiency and enantioselective control.

Predator–prey interactions between droplets driven by non-reciprocal oil exchange

Chemotactic interactions are ubiquitous in nature and can lead to non-reciprocal and complex emergent behaviour in multibody systems. However, developing synthetic, inanimate embodiments of a chemomechanical framework to generate non-reciprocal interactions of tunable strength and directionality has been challenging. Here we show how chemotactic signalling between microscale oil droplets of different chemistries in micellar surfactant solutions can result in predator–prey-like non-reciprocal chasing interactions. The interactions and dynamic self-organization result from the net directional, micelle-mediated transport of oil between emulsion droplets of differing composition and are powered by the free energy of mixing. We systematically elucidated chemical design rules to tune the interactions between droplets by varying the oil and surfactant chemical structure and concentration. Through the integration of experiment and simulation, we also investigated the active behaviour and dynamic reorganization of multidroplet clusters. Our findings demonstrate how chemically minimal systems can be designed with controllable, non-reciprocal chemotactic interactions to generate emergent self-organization and collective behaviours reminiscent of biological systems. Interactions that generate directed movement in response to a chemical stimulus occur in nature but have been difficult to realize in synthetic systems. Now, it has been shown that asymmetric micelle-mediated exchange of haloalkanes can be used to create tunable chasing interactions between chemically distinct microdroplets. Collective interactions lead to the formation of droplet assemblies with emergent self-organization and collective behaviours.

Dynamic covalent chemistry enables formation of antimicrobial peptide quaternary assemblies in a completely abiotic manner

Naturally occurring peptides and proteins often use dynamic disulfide bonds to impart defined tertiary/quaternary structures for the formation of binding pockets with uniform size and function. Although peptide synthesis and modification are well established, controlling quaternary structure formation remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the facile incorporation of aryl aldehyde and acyl hydrazide functionalities into peptide oligomers via solid-phase copper-catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (SP-CuAAC) click reactions. When mixed, these complementary functional groups rapidly react in aqueous media at neutral pH to form peptide–peptide intermolecular macrocycles with highly tunable ring sizes. Moreover, sequence-specific figure-of-eight, dumbbell-shaped, zipper-like and multi-loop quaternary structures were formed selectively. Controlling the proportions of reacting peptides with mismatched numbers of complementary reactive groups results in the formation of higher-molecular-weight sequence-defined ladder polymers. This also amplified antimicrobial effectiveness in select cases. This strategy represents a general approach to the creation of complex abiotic peptide quaternary structures. Despite advances in peptide synthesis techniques, explicit control over the quaternary structure of synthetic peptides has remained elusive. Now, the dynamic covalent chemistry of hydrazide- and aldehyde-containing peptides has now been shown to enable the formation of unique quaternary structures with topological diversity. Using this method, oligomers were assembled into complex structures showing dramatic enhancements of antimicrobial effectiveness versus Staphylococcus Aureus.

Electrostatic co-assembly of nanoparticles with oppositely charged small molecules into static and dynamic superstructures

Coulombic interactions can be used to assemble charged nanoparticles into higher-order structures, but the process requires oppositely charged partners that are similarly sized. The ability to mediate the assembly of such charged nanoparticles using structurally simple small molecules would greatly facilitate the fabrication of nanostructured materials and harnessing their applications in catalysis, sensing and photonics. Here we show that small molecules with as few as three electric charges can effectively induce attractive interactions between oppositely charged nanoparticles in water. These interactions can guide the assembly of charged nanoparticles into colloidal crystals of a quality previously only thought to result from their co-crystallization with oppositely charged nanoparticles of a similar size. Transient nanoparticle assemblies can be generated using positively charged nanoparticles and multiply charged anions that are enzymatically hydrolysed into mono- and/or dianions. Our findings demonstrate an approach for the facile fabrication, manipulation and further investigation of static and dynamic nanostructured materials in aqueous environments. Coulombic interactions can be used to assemble charged nanoparticles into higher-order structures, but this process typically requires similarly sized oppositely charged partners. Now, small anions or cations with as few as three charges have been shown to induce attractive interactions between oppositely charged nanoparticles in water, guiding the assembly of colloidal crystals.

Amine hemilability enables boron to mechanistically resemble either hydride or proton

Tetracoordinate MIDA (N-methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates have found broad utility in chemical synthesis. Here, we describe mechanistic insights into the migratory aptitude of the MIDA boryl group in boron transfer processes, and show that the hemilability of the nitrogen atom on the MIDA ligand enables boron to mechanistically resemble either a hydride or a proton. The first case involves a 1,2-boryl shift, in which boron migrates as a nucleophile in its tetracoordinate form. The second case involves a neighbouring atom-promoted 1,4-boryl shift, in which boron migrates as an electrophile in its pseudo-tricoordinate form. Density functional theory studies and in situ NMR measurements all suggest that MIDA can act as a dynamic switch. These findings encouraged the development of novel migration processes involving boron that exploit the chameleonic behaviour of boron by acting as both a nucleophile and an electrophile, including the first report of a compound with a boronate functionality bound to carbon in the carboxylic acid oxidation state. Mechanistic studies of the hemilability of MIDA (N-methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates reveal the chameleonic behaviour of the BMIDA group. The superior migratory aptitude of BMIDA compared to hydride and the capacity to resemble a proton when nitrogen decoordinates from boron have now been exploited for the design of new boron transfer reactions.

A three-shell supramolecular complex enables the symmetry-mismatched chemo- and regioselective bis-functionalization of C60

Molecular Russian dolls (matryoshkas) have proven useful for testing the limits of preparative supramolecular chemistry but applications of these architectures to problems in other fields are elusive. Here we report a three-shell, matryoshka-like complex—in which C60 sits inside a cycloparaphenylene nanohoop, which in turn is encapsulated inside a self-assembled nanocapsule—that can be used to address a long-standing challenge in fullerene chemistry, namely the selective formation of a particular fullerene bis-adduct. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the ternary complex is sufficiently stable in solution for the two outer shells to affect the addition chemistry of the fullerene guest. When the complex is subjected to Bingel cyclopropanation conditions, the exclusive formation of a single trans-3 fullerene bis-adduct was observed in a reaction that typically yields more than a dozen products. The selectivity facilitated by this matryoshka-like approach appears to be a general phenomenon and could be useful for applications where regioisomerically pure C60 bis-adducts have been shown to have superior properties compared with isomer mixtures. A supramolecular three-shell matryoshka-like complex di rects the functionalization of the C60 inner shell to the selective formation of a single trans-3 fullerene bis-adduct. The selectivity with this matryoshka-like approach could be useful for applications where regioisomerically pure C60 bis-adducts have been shown to have superior properties compared with isomer mixtures.

Cell-permeable nanobodies for targeted immunolabelling and antigen manipulation in living cells

Functional antibody delivery in living cells would enable the labelling and manipulation of intracellular antigens, which constitutes a long-thought goal in cell biology and medicine. Here we present a modular strategy to create functional cell-permeable nanobodies capable of targeted labelling and manipulation of intracellular antigens in living cells. The cell-permeable nanobodies are formed by the site-specific attachment of intracellularly stable (or cleavable) cyclic arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides to camelid-derived single-chain VHH antibody fragments. We used this strategy for the non-endocytic delivery of two recombinant nanobodies into living cells, which enabled the relocalization of the polymerase clamp PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and tumour suppressor p53 to the nucleolus, and thereby allowed the detection of protein–protein interactions that involve these two proteins in living cells. Furthermore, cell-permeable nanobodies permitted the co-transport of therapeutically relevant proteins, such as Mecp2, into the cells. This technology constitutes a major step in the labelling, delivery and targeted manipulation of intracellular antigens. Ultimately, this approach opens the door towards immunostaining in living cells and the expansion of immunotherapies to intracellular antigen targets. Delivery of antibodies into living cells enables the labelling and manipulation of intracellular antigens; however, transporting antibodies into the cytosol in a functional state is difficult. Now, a modular strategy for creating cell-permeable nanobodies capable of targeting intracellular antigens has been developed. The cell-permeable nanobodies are formed by site-specific attachment of cyclic arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides to camelid-derived single-chain antibody fragments.

Biocatalytic site- and enantioselective oxidative dearomatization of phenols

The biocatalytic transformations used by chemists are often restricted to simple functional-group interconversions. In contrast, nature has developed complexity-generating biocatalytic reactions within natural product pathways. These sophisticated catalysts are rarely employed by chemists, because the substrate scope, selectivity and robustness of these catalysts are unknown. Our strategy to bridge the gap between the biosynthesis and synthetic chemistry communities leverages the diversity of catalysts available within natural product pathways. Here we show that, starting from a suite of biosynthetic enzymes, catalysts with complementary substrate scope as well as selectivity can be identified. This strategy has been applied to the oxidative dearomatization of phenols, a chemical transformation that rapidly builds molecular complexity from simple starting materials and cannot be accomplished with high selectivity using existing catalytic methods. Using enzymes from biosynthetic pathways, we have successfully developed a method to produce ortho-quinol products with controlled site- and stereoselectivity. Furthermore, we have capitalized on the scalability and robustness of this method in gram-scale reactions as well as multi-enzyme and chemoenzymatic cascades. Within natural product biosynthetic pathways, nature has evolved highly selective catalysts capable of complexity-generating reactions. Leveraging these tools, a suite of catalysts with complementary site- and stereoselectivity have been applied to the oxidative dearomatization of phenolic compounds, enabling one-pot transformations of phenols into various natural products.

Title: 
A two-directional vibrational probe reveals different electric field orientations in solution and an enzyme active site

The catalytic power of an electric field depends on its magnitude and orientation with respect to the reactive chemical species. Understanding and designing new catalysts for electrostatic catalysis thus requires methods to measure the electric field orientation and magnitude at the molecular scale. We demonstrate that electric field orientations can be extracted using a two-directional vibrational probe by exploiting the vibrational Stark effect of both the C=O and C–D stretches of a deuterated aldehyde. Combining spectroscopy with molecular dynamics and electronic structure partitioning methods, we demonstrate that, despite distinct polarities, solvents act similarly in their preference for electrostatically stabilizing large bond dipoles at the expense of destabilizing small ones. In contrast, we find that for an active-site aldehyde inhibitor of liver alcohol dehydrogenase, the electric field orientation deviates markedly from that found in solvents, which provides direct evidence for the fundamental difference between the electrostatic environment of solvents and that of a preorganized enzyme active site. Preorganized electric fields may be essential for the extraordinary catalytic power of enzymes. Now, it has been demonstrated how electric field strengths can be monitored along two directions using a vibrational Stark probe, enabling the observation of distinct electric field orientations in an enzyme active site compared with those in simple solvents.

Single-chromophore single-molecule photocatalyst for the production of dihydrogen using low-energy light

Single-chromophore single-molecule photocatalysts for the conversion and storage of solar energy into chemical bonds are rare, inefficient and do not use significant portions of the visible spectrum. Here we show a new, air-stable bimetallic scaffold that acts as a single-chromophore photocatalyst for hydrogen-gas generation and operates with irradiation wavelengths that span the ultraviolet to the red/near-infrared. Irradiation in acidic solutions that contain an electron donor results in the catalytic production of hydrogen with 170 ± 5 turnovers in 24 hours and an initial rate of 28 turnovers per hour. The catalysis proceeds through two stepwise excited-state redox events—atypical of the currently known homogeneous photocatalysis—and features the storage of multiple redox equivalents on a dirhodium catalyst enabled by low-energy light. Homogeneous photocatalysts for the conversion and storage of solar energy typically feature separate sensitizer–catalyst assemblies, whereas previous examples of single-chromophore single-molecule photocatalysts are inefficient and do not use significant portions of the visible spectrum. Now a dirhodium single-chromophore single-molecule catalyst has been developed that generates hydrogen using low-energy light through a previously unobserved mechanism.

Title: 
Regio- and enantioselective remote dioxygenation of internal alkenes

Methods for the enantioselective direct oxygenation of internal alkenes have provided chemists with versatile and powerful toolboxes for the synthesis of optically pure alcohols, one of the most privileged structural motifs. Regioselectivity, however, remains a formidable challenge in the functionalization of internal alkenes. Here we report a palladium-catalysed highly regio- and enantioselective remote 1,n-dioxygenation (n ≥ 4) of internal alkenes with engineered pyridine-oxazoline (Pyox) ligands. The reactions proceed efficiently and exhibit a broad substrate scope with excellent regio- and enantioselectivity, affording optically pure 1,n-diol acetates as the key synthons for important bioactive molecules. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations provide evidence that the regioselectivity is governed by the reactivity disparity of two allylic C–H bonds, where the oxypalladation is reversible and the first palladium migration step proves to be the regioselectivity-determining step, enabled by the modified phenyl-substituted Pyox ligands. Functionalization of unsymmetrical internal alkenes usually takes place with low regioselectivity, giving a mixture of isomers. Now, a highly regio- and enantioselective remote 1,n-dioxygenation of internal alkenes using a palladium catalyst has been developed for the synthesis of chiral 1,n-diols. Regioselectivity tuning was demonstrated by altering the rate-determining step, enabled by the phenyl-substituted Pyox ligand.

Imitation of β-lactam binding enables broad-spectrum metallo-β-lactamase inhibitors

Carbapenems are vital antibiotics, but their efficacy is increasingly compromised by metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs). Here we report the discovery and optimization of potent broad-spectrum MBL inhibitors. A high-throughput screen for NDM-1 inhibitors identified indole-2-carboxylates (InCs) as potential β-lactamase stable β-lactam mimics. Subsequent structure–activity relationship studies revealed InCs as a new class of potent MBL inhibitor, active against all MBL classes of major clinical relevance. Crystallographic studies revealed a binding mode of the InCs to MBLs that, in some regards, mimics that predicted for intact carbapenems, including with respect to maintenance of the Zn(II)-bound hydroxyl, and in other regards mimics binding observed in MBL–carbapenem product complexes. InCs restore carbapenem activity against multiple drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and have a low frequency of resistance. InCs also have a good in vivo safety profile, and when combined with meropenem show a strong in vivo efficacy in peritonitis and thigh mouse infection models. The efficacy of carbapenem antibiotics can be compromised by metallo-β-lactamases, but a high-throughput screen followed by optimization has now enabled the discovery of indole-2-carboxylates (InCs) as potent broad-spectrum metallo-β-lactamase inhibitors. The results highlight the potential of InC–carbapenem combinations for clinical use as well as mechanism-guided approaches to combatting globally disseminated antibiotic resistant mechanisms.

Title: 
Multi-responsive hydrogel structures from patterned droplet networks

Responsive hydrogels that undergo controlled shape changes in response to a range of stimuli are of interest for microscale soft robotic and biomedical devices. However, these applications require fabrication methods capable of preparing complex, heterogeneous materials. Here we report a new approach for making patterned, multi-material and multi-responsive hydrogels, on a micrometre to millimetre scale. Nanolitre aqueous pre-gel droplets were connected through lipid bilayers in predetermined architectures and photopolymerized to yield continuous hydrogel structures. By using this droplet network technology to pattern domains containing temperature-responsive or non-responsive hydrogels, structures that undergo reversible curling were produced. Through patterning of gold nanoparticle-containing domains into the hydrogels, light-activated shape change was achieved, while domains bearing magnetic particles allowed movement of the structures in a magnetic field. To highlight our technique, we generated a multi-responsive hydrogel that, at one temperature, could be moved through a constriction under a magnetic field and, at a second temperature, could grip and transport a cargo. Responsive hydrogels are of interest for a range of potential applications, including microscale soft robotic and biomedical devices. Now, a versatile fabrication approach has been developed to prepare patterned, multi-material and multi-responsive hydrogels. Pre-gel droplets are connected through lipid bilayers in predetermined architectures and photopolymerized to yield continuous hydrogel structures that respond to a variety of stimuli.

Title: 
Selectivity control in hydrogenation through adaptive catalysis using ruthenium nanoparticles on a CO2-responsive support

With the advent of renewable carbon resources, multifunctional catalysts are becoming essential to hydrogenate selectively biomass-derived substrates and intermediates. However, the development of adaptive catalytic systems, that is, with reversibly adjustable reactivity, able to cope with the intermittence of renewable resources remains a challenge. Here, we report the preparation of a catalytic system designed to respond adaptively to feed gas composition in hydrogenation reactions. Ruthenium nanoparticles immobilized on amine-functionalized polymer-grafted silica act as active and stable catalysts for the hydrogenation of biomass-derived furfural acetone and related substrates. Hydrogenation of the carbonyl group is selectively switched on or off if pure H2 or a H2/CO2 mixture is used, respectively. The formation of alkylammonium formate species by the catalytic reaction of CO2 and H2 at the amine-functionalized support has been identified as the most likely molecular trigger for the selectivity switch. As this reaction is fully reversible, the catalyst performance responds almost in real time to the feed gas composition. A multifunctional catalytic system composed of ruthenium nanoparticles immobilized on a silica surface decorated with an amine-functionalized polymer is used for the hydrogenation of biomass-derived furfural acetone and related substrates. The presence or absence of CO2 in the gas feed alters the selectivity of the hydrogenation—producing either a ketone or a saturated alcohol, respectively—in a fully reversible manner.

Title: 
Scalable and uniform 1D nanoparticles by synchronous polymerization, crystallization and self-assembly

The preparation of well-defined nanoparticles based on soft matter, using solution-processing techniques on a commercially viable scale, is a major challenge of widespread importance. Self-assembly of block copolymers in solvents that selectively solvate one of the segments provides a promising route to core-corona nanoparticles (micelles) with a wide range of potential uses. Nevertheless, significant limitations to this approach also exist. For example, the solution processing of block copolymers generally follows a separate synthesis step and is normally performed at high dilution. Moreover, non-spherical micelles—which are promising for many applications—are generally difficult to access, samples are polydisperse and precise dimensional control is not possible. Here we demonstrate the formation of platelet and cylindrical micelles at concentrations up to 25% solids via a one-pot approach—starting from monomers—that combines polymerization-induced and crystallization-driven self-assembly. We also show that performing the procedure in the presence of small seed micelles allows the scalable formation of low dispersity samples of cylindrical micelles of controlled length up to three micrometres. A scalable, one-pot, solution-based protocol for the controlled synthesis of uniform non-spherical block copolymer micelles is a desirable but challenging target. Now, a polymerization-induced crystallization-driven self-assembly process has been developed that offers facile access to 1D and platelet micelle morphologies and to near monodisperse cylinders of controlled length.

Title: 
Dipolar order in an amphidynamic crystalline metal–organic framework through reorienting linkers

Amphidynamic crystals, which possess crystallinity and support dynamic behaviours, are very well suited to the exploration of emergent phenomena that result from the coupling on the dynamic moieties. Here, dipolar rotors have been embedded in a crystalline metal–organic framework. The material consists of Zn(ii) nodes and two types of ditopic bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-based linkers—one that coordinates to the Zn clusters through two 1,4-aza moieties, and a difluoro-functionalized derivative (the dipolar rotor) that coordinates through linked 1,4-dicarboxylate groups instead. Upon cooling, these linkers collectively order as a result of correlated dipole–dipole interactions. Variable-temperature, frequency-dependent dielectric measurements revealed a transition temperature Tc = 100 K, when a rapidly rotating, dipole-disordered, paraelectric phase transformed into an ordered, antiferroelectric one in which the dipole moments of the rotating linkers largely cancelled each other. Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional rotary lattice showed a ground state with an Ising symmetry and the effects of dipole–lattice and dipole–dipole interactions. A metal–organic framework (MOF) has been prepared that features dynamic rotors embedded within its crystalline lattice. The dipolar F2-functionalized carboxylate linkers—rapidly rotating at room temperature—show correlated behaviour upon cooling, converting the paraelectric MOF into an ordered antiferroelectric one below 100 K.

Title: 
Photoinduced inverse vulcanization

The inverse vulcanization (IV) of elemental sulfur to generate sulfur-rich functional polymers has attracted much recent attention. However, the harsh reaction conditions required, even with metal catalysts, constrains the range of feasible crosslinkers. We report here a photoinduced IV that enables reaction at ambient temperatures, greatly broadening the scope for both substrates and products. These conditions enable volatile and gaseous alkenes and alkynes to be used in IV, leading to sustainable alternatives for environmentally harmful plastics that were hitherto inaccessible. Density functional theory calculations reveal different energy barriers for thermal, catalytic and photoinduced IV processes. This protocol circumvents the long curing times that are common in IV, generates no H2S by-products, and produces high-molecular-weight polymers (up to 460,000 g mol−1) with almost 100% atom economy. This photoinduced IV strategy advances both the fundamental chemistry of IV and its potential industrial application to generate materials from waste feedstocks. Inverse vulcanization (IV) generates sulfur-rich functional polymers from elemental sulfur and organic crosslinkers, but the harsh reaction conditions required limit the scope of suitable crosslinkers. Now, a photoinduced IV has been shown to proceed at ambient temperatures, enabling the use of volatile and gaseous alkenes and alkynes as crosslinkers and broadening the range of products.

Title: 
Characterization of a selenocysteine-ligated P450 compound I reveals direct link between electron donation and reactivity

Strong electron-donation from the axial thiolate ligand of cytochrome P450 has been proposed to increase the reactivity of compound I with respect to C–H bond activation. However, it has proven difficult to test this hypothesis, and a direct link between reactivity and electron donation has yet to be established. To make this connection, we have prepared a selenolate-ligated cytochrome P450 compound I intermediate. This isoelectronic perturbation allows for direct comparisons with the wild-type enzyme. Selenium incorporation was achieved using a cysteine auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain. The intermediate was prepared with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid and characterized by UV–visible, Mössbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Measurements revealed increased asymmetry around the ferryl moiety, consistent with increased electron donation from the axial selenolate ligand. In line with this observation, we find that the selenolate-ligated compound I cleaves C–H bonds more rapidly than the wild-type intermediate. The oxidative prowess of cytochrome P450s has been suggested to stem from the electron-donating axial ligand. Now, a selenocysteine-ligated P450 compound I has been trapped and characterized providing an avenue to examine this hypothesis. Measurements reveal that the selenolate-ligated compound I cleaves C–H bonds more rapidly than the wild-type equivalent.

Title: 
Stoichiometric two-dimensional non-van der Waals AgCrS2 with superionic behaviour at room temperature

Layered materials have attracted tremendous interest for accessing two-dimensional structures. Materials such as graphite or transition metal dichalcogenides, in which the layers are held together by van der Waals interactions, can be exfoliated through a variety of processes in a manner that retains the structure and composition of the monolayers, but this has proven difficult for solids with stronger interlayer interactions. Here, we demonstrate the exfoliation of AgCrS2, a member of the AMX2 family (where A is a monovalent metal, M is a trivalent metal and X is a chalcogen), through intercalation with tetraalkylammonium cations, chosen for their suitable redox potential. The as-exfoliated nanosheets consist of Ag layers sandwiched between two CrS2 layers, similar to their structure in the bulk. They show superionic behaviour at room temperature, with an ionic conductivity of 33.2 mS cm−1 at 298 K that originates from Ag+ ions rapidly hopping between neighbouring tetrahedral interstices; in the bulk, this behaviour is only observed above 673 K. Layered materials held together by weak interactions can be exfoliated into monolayers that retain the structure and composition of their bulk counterpart, but this has remained challenging to achieve for non-van der Waals materials. Now, AgCrS2 has been exfoliated into such [CrS2]Ag[CrS2] nanosheets through intercalation with tetraalkylammonium cations chosen for their suitable redox potential. The nanosheets show superionic behaviour at room temperature.

Title: 
Control of dynamic sp3-C stereochemistry

Stereogenic sp3-hybridized carbon centres are fundamental building blocks of chiral molecules. Unlike dynamic stereogenic motifs, such as sp3-nitrogen centres or atropisomeric biaryls, sp3-carbon centres are usually fixed, requiring intermolecular reactions to undergo configurational changes. Here we report the internal enantiomerization of fluxional carbon cages and the consequences of their adaptive configurations for the transmission of stereochemical information. The sp3-carbon stereochemistry of the rigid tricyclic cages is inverted through strain-assisted Cope rearrangements, emulating the low-barrier configurational dynamics typical for sp3-nitrogen inversion or conformational isomerism. This dynamic enantiomerization can be stopped, restarted or slowed by external reagents, while the configuration of the cage is controlled by neighbouring, fixed stereogenic centres. As part of a phosphoramidite–olefin ligand, the fluxional cage acts as a conduit to transmit stereochemical information from the ligand while also transferring its dynamic properties to chiral-at-metal coordination environments, influencing catalysis, ion pairing and ligand exchange energetics. Stereogenic sp3-hybridized carbon centres are the principal building blocks of chiral organic molecules. Usually, these centres are configurationally fixed. Now, low-energy pericyclic rearrangements have been used to create rigid cage molecules with fluxional sp3-stereochemistry, influencing chiral information transfer. The sp3-carbon stereochemistry of the cages is inverted through strain-assisted Cope rearrangements.

Selection of DNA-encoded chemical libraries against endogenous membrane proteins on live cells

Membrane proteins on the cell surface perform a myriad of biological functions; however, ligand discovery for membrane proteins is highly challenging, because a natural cellular environment is often necessary to maintain protein structure and function. DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DELs) have emerged as a powerful technology for ligand discovery, but they are mainly limited to purified proteins. Here we report a method that can specifically label membrane proteins with a DNA tag, and thereby enable target-specific DEL selections against endogenous membrane proteins on live cells without overexpression or any other genetic manipulation. We demonstrate the generality and performance of this method by screening a 30.42-million-compound DEL against the folate receptor, carbonic anhydrase 12 and the epidermal growth factor receptor on live cells, and identify and validate a series of novel ligands for these targets. Given the high therapeutic significance of membrane proteins and their intractability to traditional high-throughput screening approaches, this method has the potential to facilitate membrane-protein-based drug discovery by harnessing the power of DEL. A method to label membrane proteins with a DNA tag has been developed that enables the selection of DNA-encoded chemical libraries against endogenous membrane proteins on live cells. As a demonstration, a 30-million-compound DNA-encoded chemical library is screened against folate receptor, carbonic anhydrase 12 and epidermal growth factor receptor on live cells.

Title: 
Tyrosine sulfation modulates activity of tick-derived thrombin inhibitors

Madanin-1 and chimadanin are two small cysteine-free thrombin inhibitors that facilitate blood feeding in the tick Haemaphysalis longicornis. Here, we report a post-translational modification—tyrosine sulfation—of these two proteins that is critical for potent anti-thrombotic and anticoagulant activity. Inhibitors produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells displayed heterogeneous sulfation of two tyrosine residues within each of the proteins. One-pot ligation–desulfurization chemistry enabled access to homogeneous samples of all possible sulfated variants of the proteins. Tyrosine sulfation of madanin-1 and chimadanin proved crucial for thrombin inhibitory activity, with the doubly sulfated variants three orders of magnitude more potent than the unmodified inhibitors. The three-dimensional structure of madanin-1 in complex with thrombin revealed a unique mode of inhibition, with the sulfated tyrosine residues binding to the basic exosite II of the protease. The importance of tyrosine sulfation within this family of thrombin inhibitors, together with their unique binding mode, paves the way for the development of anti-thrombotic drug leads based on these privileged scaffolds. Tyrosine sulfation strongly enhances the inhibition of thrombin by the tick-derived anticoagulants madanin-1 and chimadanin. Protein chemical synthesis and structural studies have revealed a mode of inhibition that is unprecedented among cysteine-free anticoagulant proteins. This inhibition occurs through the recognition of the highly basic exosite II of thrombin.

Manganese-catalysed benzylic C(sp3)–H amination for late-stage functionalization

Reactions that directly install nitrogen into C–H bonds of complex molecules are significant because of their potential to change the chemical and biological properties of a given compound. Although selective intramolecular C–H amination reactions are known, achieving high levels of reactivity while maintaining excellent site selectivity and functional-group tolerance remains a challenge for intermolecular C–H amination. Here, we report a manganese perchlorophthalocyanine catalyst [MnIII(ClPc)] for intermolecular benzylic C–H amination of bioactive molecules and natural products that proceeds with unprecedented levels of reactivity and site selectivity. In the presence of a Brønsted or Lewis acid, the [MnIII(ClPc)]-catalysed C–H amination demonstrates unique tolerance for tertiary amine, pyridine and benzimidazole functionalities. Mechanistic studies suggest that C–H amination likely proceeds through an electrophilic metallonitrene intermediate via a stepwise pathway where C–H cleavage is the rate-determining step of the reaction. Collectively, these mechanistic features contrast with previous base–metal-catalysed C–H aminations and provide new opportunities for tunable selectivities. A manganese phthalocyanine has been shown to catalyse intermolecular C–H amination reactions—proceeding through an electrophilic metallonitrene intermediate—with high levels of reactivity and site selectivity. Demonstrating good tolerance for tertiary amine, pyridine and benzimidazole moieties, nitrogen functionality can be selectively installed at electron-rich, sterically exposed benzylic sites in bioactive molecules.

Prebiotic synthesis of α-amino acids and orotate from α-ketoacids potentiates transition to extant metabolic pathways

The Strecker reaction of aldehydes is the pre-eminent pathway to explain the prebiotic origins of α-amino acids. However, biology employs transamination of α-ketoacids to synthesize amino acids which are then transformed to nucleobases, implying an evolutionary switch—abiotically or biotically—of a prebiotic pathway involving the Strecker reaction into today’s biosynthetic pathways. Here we show that α-ketoacids react with cyanide and ammonia sources to form the corresponding α-amino acids through the Bucherer–Bergs pathway. An efficient prebiotic transformation of oxaloacetate to aspartate via N-carbamoyl aspartate enables the simultaneous formation of dihydroorotate, paralleling the biochemical synthesis of orotate as the precursor to pyrimidine nucleobases. Glyoxylate forms both glycine and orotate and reacts with malonate and urea to form aspartate and dihydroorotate. These results, along with the previously demonstrated protometabolic analogues of the Krebs cycle, suggest that there can be a natural emergence of congruent forerunners of biological pathways with the potential for seamless transition from prebiotic chemistry to modern metabolism. The apparent disconnect between prebiotic aldehyde-based Strecker synthesis of amino acids and the α-ketoacid-based metabolism of extant biochemistry necessitates an evolutionary switch between these disparate chemistries. Now it has been shown that Bucherer–Bergs reactions of α-ketoacids produce α-amino acids and dihydroorotate, paralleling the biochemical synthesis of orotate and suggesting a more congruent evolutionary pathway from cyanide-based chemistries.

Control over differentiation of a metastable supramolecular assembly in one and two dimensions

Molecular self-assembly under kinetic control is expected to yield nanostructures that are inaccessible through the spontaneous thermodynamic process. Moreover, time-dependent evolution, which is reminiscent of biomolecular systems, may occur under such out-of-equilibrium conditions, allowing the synthesis of supramolecular assemblies with enhanced complexities. Here we report on the capacity of a metastable porphyrin supramolecular assembly to differentiate into nanofibre and nanosheet structures. Mechanistic studies of the relationship between the molecular design and pathway complexity in the self-assembly unveiled the energy landscape that governs the unique kinetic behaviour. Based on this understanding, we could control the differentiation phenomena and achieve both one- and two-dimensional living supramolecular polymerization using an identical monomer. Furthermore, we found that the obtained nanostructures are electronically distinct, which illustrates the pathway-dependent material properties. Unlike in biomolecular systems, synthetic self-assembly is largely spontaneous, thus limiting the complexity and functionality of the materials one can create. Now, self-assembly under out-of-equilibrium conditions is demonstrated for a metastable supramolecular system. Differentiation of nanoparticles into nanofibres and nanosheets — with electronically distinct states — is achieved through kinetic control, illustrating pathway-dependent material properties.

Active repair of a dinuclear photocatalyst for visible-light-driven hydrogen production

The molecular apparatus behind biological photosynthesis retains its long-term functionality through enzymatic repair. However, bioinspired molecular devices designed for artificial photosynthesis, consisting of a photocentre, a bridging ligand and a catalytic centre, can become unstable and break down when their individual modules are structurally compromised, halting their overall functionality and operation. Here we report the active repair of such an artificial photosynthetic molecular device, leading to complete recovery of catalytic activity. We have identified the hydrogenation of the bridging ligand, which inhibits the light-driven electron transfer between the photocentre and catalytic centre, as the deactivation mechanism. As a means of repair, we used the light-driven generation of singlet oxygen, catalysed by the photocentre, to enable the oxidative dehydrogenation of the bridging unit, which leads to the restoration of photocatalytic hydrogen formation. Molecular catalysts for artificial photosynthesis can break down during operation and stop working, whereas biological photosynthesis uses an enzymatic repair strategy to maintain function. Now, the degradation pathway of a hydrogen-evolving RuPt photocatalyst has been identified, enabling the development of an active repair strategy involving the use of 1O2 to reoxidize the deactivated bridging ligand.

Asymmetric, visible light-mediated radical sulfinyl-Smiles rearrangement to access all-carbon quaternary stereocentres

The asymmetric construction of all-carbon quaternary centres within acyclic settings represents a long-standing challenge for synthetic chemists. Alongside polar and radical methods, rearrangement reactions represent an attractive platform, but still broadly applicable methods are in high demand. Here we report an asymmetric, radical sulfinyl-Smiles rearrangement to access acyclic amides that bear an α-all-carbon quaternary centre. Our strategy uses enantioenriched N-arylsulfinyl acrylamides as acceptors for a variety of radicals produced in situ under mild photoredox conditions. The sulfinamido group not only directs the 1,4-migration of the aryl moiety onto the α-carbon of the amide, which thus governs its absolute configuration, but also functions as a traceless chiral auxiliary. The amides obtained in this multicomponent process are prevalent in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and bioactive natural products, and can be transformed into valuable chiral α,α-disubstituted acids, oxindoles as well as into β,β-disubstituted amines, highlighting the synthetic potential of this transformation. The assembly of a single configuration of an all-carbon quaternary centre within acyclic systems remains a challenge for synthetic chemists. Now, it has been shown that α-all-carbon quaternary centres can be installed in acyclic amides, with excellent levels of absolute stereocontrol, through a radical sulfinyl Truce–Smiles rearrangement.

Shear-induced assembly of a transient yet highly stretchable hydrogel based on pseudopolyrotaxanes

Dissipative self-assembly is common in biological systems, where it serves to maintain a far-from-equilibrium functional state through fuel consumption. Synthetic dissipative systems have been prepared that can mimic some of the properties of biological systems, but they often show poor mechanical performance. Here, we report a shear-induced transient hydrogel that is highly stretchable. The system is constructed by adding Cu(ii) into the aqueous solution of a pseudopolyrotaxane, which is itself formed by threading molecular tubes on polyethylene glycol chains. Vigorous shaking transforms the solution into a gel, which gradually relaxes back to the sol state over time. This cycle can be repeated at least five times. A mechanism is proposed that relies on a shear-induced transition from intrachain to interchain coordination and subsequent thermal relaxation. The far-from-equilibrium hydrogel is highly stretchable, which is probably due to ‘frictional’ sliding of the molecular tubes on the polyethylene glycol chains. On shaking, the hydrogel undergoes fast self-healing. Synthetic dissipative systems, formed by out-of-equilibrium self-assembly processes, can mimic some of the properties of biological systems, but often show poor mechanical performance. Now, a shear-induced transient hydrogel has been prepared that is also highly stretchable. The system is based on coordination interactions between Cu(ii) centres and the pendant carboxylate groups of a pseudopolyrotaxane.

Constructing covalent organic nanoarchitectures molecule by molecule via scanning probe manipulation

Constructing low-dimensional covalent assemblies with tailored size and connectivity is challenging yet often key for applications in molecular electronics where optical and electronic properties of the quantum materials are highly structure dependent. We present a versatile approach for building such structures block by block on bilayer sodium chloride (NaCl) films on Cu(111) with the tip of an atomic force microscope, while tracking the structural changes with single-bond resolution. Covalent homo-dimers in cis and trans configurations and homo-/hetero-trimers were selectively synthesized by a sequence of dehalogenation, translational manipulation and intermolecular coupling of halogenated precursors. Further demonstrations of structural build-up include complex bonding motifs, like carbon–iodine–carbon bonds and fused carbon pentagons. This work paves the way for synthesizing elusive covalent nanoarchitectures, studying structural modifications and revealing pathways of intermolecular reactions. Tailoring the size and connectivity of organic nanostructures is challenging but is often key in molecular electronics for tuning the properties of the quantum materials. Now an approach has been developed for building low-dimensional covalent architectures block by block on a surface by highly selective tip-induced intermolecular reactions.

Title: 
A monodisperse transmembrane α-helical peptide barrel

The fabrication of monodisperse transmembrane barrels formed from short synthetic peptides has not been demonstrated previously. This is in part because of the complexity of the interactions between peptides and lipids within the hydrophobic environment of a membrane. Here we report the formation of a transmembrane pore through the self-assembly of 35 amino acid α-helical peptides. The design of the peptides is based on the C-terminal D4 domain of the Escherichia coli polysaccharide transporter Wza. By using single-channel current recording, we define discrete assembly intermediates and show that the pore is most probably a helix barrel that contains eight D4 peptides arranged in parallel. We also show that the peptide pore is functional and capable of conducting ions and binding blockers. Such α-helix barrels engineered from peptides could find applications in nanopore technologies such as single-molecule sensing and nucleic-acid sequencing. The assembly of transmembrane barrels formed from short synthetic peptides has not been previously demonstrated. Now, a transmembrane pore has been fabricated via the self-assembly of peptides. The 35-amino-acid α-helical peptides are based on the C-terminal D4 domain of the Escherichia coli polysaccharide transporter Wza.

De novo design of a hyperstable non-natural protein–ligand complex with sub-Å accuracy

Protein catalysis requires the atomic-level orchestration of side chains, substrates and cofactors, and yet the ability to design a small-molecule-binding protein entirely from first principles with a precisely predetermined structure has not been demonstrated. Here we report the design of a novel protein, PS1, that binds a highly electron-deficient non-natural porphyrin at temperatures up to 100 °C. The high-resolution structure of holo-PS1 is in sub-Å agreement with the design. The structure of apo-PS1 retains the remote core packing of the holoprotein, with a flexible binding region that is predisposed to ligand binding with the desired geometry. Our results illustrate the unification of core packing and binding-site definition as a central principle of ligand-binding protein design. The first demonstration of a protein designed entirely from first principles that binds a small-molecule cofactor in a precisely predetermined orientation has now been described. The design method utilizes a remote protein core that both anchors and predisposes a flexible binding site for the desired cofactor-binding geometry.

Supercharging enables organized assembly of synthetic biomolecules

Symmetrical protein oligomers are ubiquitous in biological systems and perform key structural and regulatory functions. However, there are few methods for constructing such oligomers. Here we have engineered completely synthetic, symmetrical oligomers by combining pairs of oppositely supercharged variants of a normally monomeric model protein through a strategy we term ‘supercharged protein assembly’ (SuPrA). We show that supercharged variants of green fluorescent protein can assemble into a variety of architectures including a well-defined symmetrical 16-mer structure that we solved using cryo-electron microscopy at 3.47 Å resolution. The 16-mer is composed of two stacked rings of octamers, in which the octamers contain supercharged proteins of alternating charges, and interactions within and between the rings are mediated by a variety of specific electrostatic contacts. The ready assembly of this structure suggests that combining oppositely supercharged pairs of protein variants may provide broad opportunities for generating novel architectures via otherwise unprogrammed interactions. Symmetrical protein oligomers perform key structural and catalytic functions in nature, but engineering such oligomers synthetically is challenging. Now, oppositely supercharged synthetic variants of normally monomeric proteins have been shown to assemble via specific, introduced electrostatic contacts into symmetrical, highly well-defined oligomers.

Observation of trapped-hole diffusion on the surfaces of CdS nanorods

In CdS nanocrystals, photoexcited holes rapidly become trapped at the particle surface. The dynamics of these trapped holes have profound consequences for the photophysics and photochemistry of these materials. Using a combination of transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical modelling, we demonstrate that trapped holes in CdS nanorods are mobile and execute a random walk at room temperature. In CdS nanorods of non-uniform width, we observe the recombination of spatially separated electrons and trapped holes, which exhibits a t−1/2 power-law decay at long times. A one-dimensional diffusion–annihilation model describes the time-dependence of the recombination over four orders of magnitude in time, from one nanosecond to ten microseconds, with a single adjustable parameter. We propose that diffusive trapped-hole motion is a general phenomenon in CdS nanocrystals, but one that is normally obscured in structures in which the wavefunctions of the electron and trapped hole spatially overlap. This phenomenon has important implications for the oxidation photochemistry of CdS nanocrystals. Photoexcited holes in CdS nanocrystals rapidly trap to the surface and although they are integral to nanocrystal photophysics and photochemistry, their dynamics have remained elusive. Time-resolved spectroscopy and theoretical modelling have now revealed that trapped holes in CdS nanorods are mobile and undergo a random walk on the nanocrystal surface.

Controlled partial interpenetration in metal–organic frameworks

Interpenetration, the entwining of multiple lattices, is a common phenomenon in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Typically, in interpenetrated MOFs the sub-lattices are fully occupied. Here we report a family of MOFs in which one sub-lattice is fully occupied and the occupancy level of the other can be controlled during synthesis to produce frameworks with variable levels of partial interpenetration. We also report an ‘autocatenation’ process, a transformation of non-interpenetrated lattices into doubly interpenetrated frameworks via progressively higher degrees of interpenetration that involves no external reagents. Autocatenation maintains crystallinity and can be triggered either thermally or by shear forces. The ligand used to construct these MOFs is chiral, and both racemic and enantiopure partially interpenetrated frameworks can be accessed. X-ray diffraction, nonlinear optical microscopy and theoretical calculations offer insights into the structures and dynamic behaviour of these materials and the growth mechanisms of interpenetrated MOFs. Interpenetration of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is a common phenomenon, in which a structure consists of two or more identical, entangled sub-lattices. Now, MOFs with variable, fractional degrees of occupancy of one of two sub-lattices have been prepared. The extent of interpenetration can be controlled either during synthesis or by autocatenation, a framework rearrangement process.

Phosphorylation, oligomerization and self-assembly in water under potential prebiotic conditions

Prebiotic phosphorylation of (pre)biological substrates under aqueous conditions is a critical step in the origins of life. Previous investigations have had limited success and/or require unique environments that are incompatible with subsequent generation of the corresponding oligomers or higher-order structures. Here, we demonstrate that diamidophosphate (DAP)—a plausible prebiotic agent produced from trimetaphosphate—efficiently (amido)phosphorylates a wide variety of (pre)biological building blocks (nucleosides/tides, amino acids and lipid precursors) under aqueous (solution/paste) conditions, without the need for a condensing agent. Significantly, higher-order structures (oligonucleotides, peptides and liposomes) are formed under the same phosphorylation reaction conditions. This plausible prebiotic phosphorylation process under similar reaction conditions could enable the systems chemistry of the three classes of (pre)biologically relevant molecules and their oligomers, in a single-pot aqueous environment. Phosphorylation of (pre)biological molecules in water has been a long-sought goal in prebiotic chemistry. Now, it has been demonstrated that diamidophosphate phosphorylates nucleosides, amino acids and glycerol/fatty acids in aqueous medium, while simultaneously leading to higher-order structures such as oligonucleotides, peptides and liposomes in the same reaction mixture.

Imaging single-molecule reaction intermediates stabilized by surface dissipation and entropy

Chemical transformations at the interface between solid/liquid or solid/gaseous phases of matter lie at the heart of key industrial-scale manufacturing processes. A comprehensive study of the molecular energetics and conformational dynamics that underlie these transformations is often limited to ensemble-averaging analytical techniques. Here we report the detailed investigation of a surface-catalysed cross-coupling and sequential cyclization cascade of 1,2-bis(2-ethynyl phenyl)ethyne on Ag(100). Using non-contact atomic force microscopy, we imaged the single-bond-resolved chemical structure of transient metastable intermediates. Theoretical simulations indicate that the kinetic stabilization of experimentally observable intermediates is determined not only by the potential-energy landscape, but also by selective energy dissipation to the substrate and entropic changes associated with key transformations along the reaction pathway. The microscopic insights gained here pave the way for the rational design and control of complex organic reactions at the surface of heterogeneous catalysts. The single-bond-resolved chemical structures of transient intermediates in a complex bimolecular reaction cascade were imaged by noncontact atomic force microscopy. Theoretical simulations reveal that the kinetic stabilization of experimentally observable intermediates is governed by selective energy dissipation to the substrate and entropic changes along the reaction pathway.

Title: 
A supramolecular helix that disregards chirality

The functions of complex crystalline systems derived from supramolecular biological and non-biological assemblies typically emerge from homochiral programmed primary structures via first principles involving secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. In contrast, heterochiral and racemic compounds yield disordered crystals, amorphous solids or liquids. Here, we report the self-assembly of perylene bisimide derivatives in a supramolecular helix that in turn self-organizes in columnar hexagonal crystalline domains regardless of the enantiomeric purity of the perylene bisimide. We show that both homochiral and racemic perylene bisimide compounds, including a mixture of 21 diastereomers that cannot be deracemized at the molecular level, self-organize to form single-handed helical assemblies with identical single-crystal-like order. We propose that this high crystalline order is generated via a cogwheel mechanism that disregards the chirality of the self-assembling building blocks. We anticipate that this mechanism will facilitate access to previously inaccessible complex crystalline systems from racemic and homochiral building blocks. The structural order of supramolecular assemblies typically depends on the enantiomeric purity of their building blocks. Now, a perylene bisimide (PBI) derivative has been described that assembles into a single-handed supramolecular helix, which in turn packs into domains with an identical crystalline order irrespective of the PBI's chirality. A cogwheel mechanism is proposed.

Title: 
Directing-group-free catalytic dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes

In the absence of directing auxiliaries, the catalytic addition of carbogenic groups to unactivated alkenes with control of regioselectivity remains an ongoing challenge in organic chemistry. Here we describe a directing-group-free, nickel-catalysed strategy that couples a broad array of unactivated and activated olefins with aryl-substituted triflates and organometallic nucleophiles to afford diarylation adducts in either regioisomeric form, in up to 93% yield and &gt;98% site selectivity. By switching the reagents involved, the present strategy may be extended to other classes of dicarbofunctionalization reactions. Mechanistic and computational investigations offer insights into the origin of the observed regiochemical outcome and the utility of the method is highlighted through the concise syntheses of biologically active molecules. The catalyst control principles reported are expected to advance efforts towards the development of general site-selective alkene functionalizations, removing the requirement for neighbouring activating groups. Without directing auxiliaries, the addition of carbogenic groups to unactivated alkenes is typically inefficient and suffers from poor regioselectivity. Now, a directing-group-free, nickel catalyst-controlled strategy has been developed, enabling the site-selective dicarbofunctionalization of a broad array of activated and unactivated alkenes.

Feshbach resonances in the exit channel of the F + CH3OH → HF + CH3O reaction observed using transition-state spectroscopy

The transition state governs how chemical bonds form and cleave during a chemical reaction and its direct characterization is a long-standing challenge in physical chemistry. Transition state spectroscopy experiments based on negative-ion photodetachment provide a direct probe of the vibrational structure and metastable resonances that are characteristic of the reactive surface. Dynamical resonances are extremely sensitive to the topography of the reactive surface and provide an exceptional point of comparison with theory. Here we study the seven-atom F + CH3OH → HF + CH3O reaction using slow photoelectron velocity-map imaging spectroscopy of cryocooled CH3OHF− anions. These measurements reveal spectral features associated with a manifold of vibrational Feshbach resonances and bound states supported by the post-transition state potential well. Quantum dynamical calculations yield excellent agreement with the experimental results, allow the assignment of spectral structure and demonstrate that the key dynamics of complex bimolecular reactions can be captured with a relatively simple theoretical framework. The transition state governs how bonds form and cleave during a reaction — its direct characterization is a long-standing challenge. Now, the F + CH3OH → HF + CH3O reactive surface has been studied using photoelectron velocity-map imaging spectroscopy of cryo-cooled anions, revealing vibrational Feshbach resonances and bound states supported by the post-transition-state potential well. The experiments agree well with quantum dynamical calculations.

Title: 
Fusing tetrapyrroles to graphene edges by surface-assisted covalent coupling

Surface-assisted covalent linking of precursor molecules enables the fabrication of low-dimensional nanostructures, which include graphene nanoribbons. One approach to building functional multicomponent systems involves the lateral anchoring of organic heteromolecules to graphene. Here we demonstrate the dehydrogenative coupling of single porphines to graphene edges on the same metal substrate as used for graphene synthesis. The covalent linkages are visualized by scanning probe techniques with submolecular resolution, which directly reveals bonding motifs and electronic features. Distinct configurations are identified that can be steered towards entities predominantly fused to graphene edges through two pyrrole rings by thermal annealing. Furthermore, we succeeded in the concomitant metallation of the macrocycle with substrate atoms and the axial ligation of adducts. Such processes combined with graphene–nanostructure synthesis has the potential to create complex materials systems with tunable functionalities. Lateral anchoring of heteromolecules to graphene paves the way for the creation of hybrid materials with tunable properties. Now, following a surface-assisted dehydrogenative coupling reaction, the edges of graphene on silver have been functionalized with porphines. This enables the assembly of well-defined multifunctional graphene-based nanostructures.

Improved performance and stability of perovskite solar cells by crystal crosslinking with alkylphosphonic acid ω-ammonium chlorides

In the past few years, organic–inorganic halide perovskites have rapidly emerged as promising materials for photovoltaic applications, but simultaneously achieving high performance and long-term stability has proved challenging. Here, we show a one-step solution-processing strategy using phosphonic acid ammonium additives that results in efficient perovskite solar cells with enhanced stability. We modify the surface of methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite by spin-coating its precursor solution in the presence of butylphosphonic acid 4-ammonium chloride. Morphological, structural and elemental analyses show that the phosphonic acid ammonium additive acts as a crosslink between neighbouring grains in the perovskite structure, through strong hydrogen bonding of the –PO(OH)2 and –NH3+ terminal groups to the perovskite surface. The additives facilitate the incorporation of the perovskite within a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, as well as the growth of a uniform perovskite layer at the surface, enhancing the material's photovoltaic performance from 8.8 to 16.7% as well as its resistance to moisture. Perovskite materials show great promise for solar cell devices, owing in particular to their high power conversion efficiency. Now, the addition of butylphosphonic acid 4-ammonium cations during a one-step process has been shown to improve both the efficiency and moisture stability of perovskite photovoltaics, through the formation of hydrogen-bonding crosslinks between neighbouring grains.

Title: 
Cooperative polymerization of α-helices induced by macromolecular architecture

Catalysis observed in enzymatic processes and protein polymerizations often relies on the use of supramolecular interactions and the organization of functional elements in order to gain control over the spatial and temporal elements of fundamental cellular processes. Harnessing these cooperative interactions to catalyse reactions in synthetic systems, however, remains challenging due to the difficulty in creating structurally controlled macromolecules. Here, we report a polypeptide-based macromolecule with spatially organized α-helices that can catalyse its own formation. The system consists of a linear polymeric scaffold containing a high density of initiating groups from which polypeptides are grown, forming a brush polymer. The folding of polypeptide side chains into α-helices dramatically enhances the polymerization rate due to cooperative interactions of macrodipoles between neighbouring α-helices. The parameters that affect the rate are elucidated by a two-stage kinetic model using principles from nucleation-controlled protein polymerizations; the key difference being the irreversible nature of this polymerization. The secondary and tertiary structure of a protein has profound implications on function and catalysis. Now, both the secondary and tertiary structures of a synthetic polymer have been utilized to catalyse the polymerization of N-carboxyanhydrides. Both the folding of the resulting polypeptides into α-helices and their macromolecular organization dramatically enhance the polymerization rate.

Neutral zero-valent s-block complexes with strong multiple bonding

The metals of the s block of the periodic table are well known to be exceptional electron donors, and the vast majority of their molecular complexes therefore contain these metals in their fully oxidized form. Low-valent main-group compounds have recently become desirable synthetic targets owing to their interesting reactivities, sometimes on a par with those of transition-metal complexes. In this work, we used stabilizing cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene ligands to isolate and characterize the first neutral compounds that contain a zero-valent s-block metal, beryllium. These brightly coloured complexes display very short beryllium–carbon bond lengths and linear beryllium coordination geometries, indicative of strong multiple Be–C bonding. Structural, spectroscopic and theoretical results show that the complexes adopt a closed-shell singlet configuration with a Be(0) metal centre. The surprising stability of the molecule can be ascribed to an unusually strong three-centre two-electron π bond across the C–Be–C unit. Two neutral compounds containing a zero-valent s-block metal, beryllium, have now been isolated and fully characterized. Structural characterization, supported by calculations, show that these brightly coloured complexes adopt a closed-shell singlet configuration with a Be(0) metal centre and an unusually strong three-centre two-electron π-bond across the C–Be–C unit.

Enantioselective, intermolecular benzylic C–H amination catalysed by an engineered iron-haem enzyme

C–H bonds are ubiquitous structural units of organic molecules. Although these bonds are generally considered to be chemically inert, the recent emergence of methods for C–H functionalization promises to transform the way synthetic chemistry is performed. The intermolecular amination of C–H bonds represents a particularly desirable and challenging transformation for which no efficient, highly selective, and renewable catalysts exist. Here we report the directed evolution of an iron-containing enzymatic catalyst—based on a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase—for the highly enantioselective intermolecular amination of benzylic C–H bonds. The biocatalyst is capable of up to 1,300 turnovers, exhibits excellent enantioselectivities, and provides access to valuable benzylic amines. Iron complexes are generally poor catalysts for C–H amination: in this catalyst, the enzyme's protein framework confers activity on an otherwise unreactive iron-haem cofactor. The intermolecular amination of C–H bonds is an enabling transformation for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing molecules; however, developing catalysts for this class of reactions is very challenging. Now, an iron-based enzyme for this reaction has been engineered, demonstrating that a protein can confer a difficult new function upon an otherwise unreactive base metal.

Title: 
Chemical tagging and customizing of cellular chromatin states using ultrafast trans-splicing inteins

Post-translational modification of the histone proteins in chromatin plays a central role in the epigenetic control of DNA-templated processes in eukaryotic cells. Developing methods that enable the structure of histones to be manipulated is, therefore, essential to understand the biochemical mechanisms that underlie genomic regulation. Here we present a synthetic biology method to engineer histones that bear site-specific modifications on cellular chromatin using protein trans-splicing (PTS). We genetically fused the N-terminal fragment of ultrafast split intein to the C terminus of histone H2B, which, on reaction with a complementary synthetic C intein, generated labelled histone. Using this approach, we incorporated various non-native chemical modifications into chromatin in vivo with temporal control. Furthermore, the time and concentration dependence of PTS performed in nucleo enabled us to examine differences in the accessibility of the euchromatin and heterochromatin regions of the epigenome. Finally, we used PTS to semisynthesize a native histone modification, H2BK120 ubiquitination, in isolated nuclei and showed that this can trigger downstream epigenetic crosstalk of H3K79 methylation. A method for engineering site-specific modifications of histone proteins within cellular chromatin has been developed using protein trans-splicing. This approach enabled a native histone modification, H2BK120 ubiquitination, to be incorporated in isolated nuclei, which was shown to trigger a downstream epigenetic effect.

Title: 
Prebiotic phosphorylation of 2-thiouridine provides either nucleotides or DNA building blocks via photoreduction

Breakthroughs in the study of the origin of life have demonstrated how some of the building blocks essential to biology could have been formed under various primordial scenarios, and could therefore have contributed to the chemical evolution of life. Missing building blocks are then sometimes inferred to be products of primitive biosynthesis, which can stretch the limits of plausibility. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of 2′-deoxy-2-thiouridine, and subsequently 2′-deoxyadenosine and 2-deoxyribose, under prebiotic conditions. 2′-Deoxy-2-thiouridine is produced by photoreduction of 2,2′-anhydro-2-thiouridine, which is in turn formed by phosphorylation of 2-thiouridine—an intermediate of prebiotic RNA synthesis. 2′-Deoxy-2-thiouridine is an effective deoxyribosylating agent and may have functioned as such in either abiotic or proto-enzyme-catalysed pathways to DNA, as demonstrated by its conversion to 2′-deoxyadenosine by reaction with adenine, and 2-deoxyribose by hydrolysis. An alternative prebiotic phosphorylation of 2-thiouridine leads to the formation of its 5′-phosphate, showing that hypotheses in which 2-thiouridine was a key component of early RNA sequences are within the bounds of synthetic credibility. RNA is usually considered to be the first genetic polymer, with DNA a product of a biochemical pathway that arose after the origin of life. Now, studies into the prebiotic phosphorylation of an RNA nucleoside reveal pathways for the synthesis of DNA building blocks, providing experimental support for a prebiotic link between RNA and DNA.

Title: 
Ephemeral collision complexes mediate chemically termolecular transformations that affect system chemistry

Termolecular association reactions involve ephemeral collision complexes—formed from the collision of two molecules—that collide with a third and chemically inert ‘bath gas’ molecule that simply transfers energy to/from the complex. These collision complexes are generally not thought to react chemically on collision with a third molecule in the gas-phase systems of combustion and planetary atmospheres. Such ‘chemically termolecular’ reactions, in which all three molecules are involved in bond making and/or breaking, were hypothesized long ago in studies establishing radical chain branching mechanisms, but were later concluded to be unimportant. Here, with data from ab initio master equation and kinetic-transport simulations, we reveal that reactions of H + O2 collision complexes with other radicals constitute major kinetic pathways under common combustion situations. These reactions are also found to influence flame propagation speeds, a common measure of global reactivity. Analogous chemically termolecular reactions mediated by ephemeral collision complexes are probably of significance in various combustion and planetary environments. Chemically termolecular reactions — arising from the collision of ephemeral collision complexes with other chemically reactive species — have been neglected in current gas-phase chemical mechanisms of combustion and planetary atmospheres. First-principles calculations reveal that such chemically termolecular reactions constitute major pathways affecting macroscopic observables.

Controlling anisotropic properties by manipulating the orientation of chiral small molecules

Chiral π-conjugated molecules bring new functionality to technological applications and represent an exciting, rapidly expanding area of research. Their functional properties, such as the absorption and emission of circularly polarized light or the transport of spin-polarized electrons, are highly anisotropic. As a result, the orientation of chiral molecules critically determines the functionality and efficiency of chiral devices. Here we present a strategy to control the orientation of a small chiral molecule (2,2′-dicyano[6]helicene) by the use of organic and inorganic templating layers. Such templating layers can either force 2,2′-dicyano[6]helicene to adopt a face-on orientation and self-assemble into upright supramolecular columns oriented with their helical axis perpendicular to the substrate, or an edge-on orientation with parallel-lying supramolecular columns. Through such control, we show that low- and high-energy chiroptical responses can be independently ‘turned on’ or ‘turned off’. The templating methodologies described here provide a simple way to engineer orientational control and, by association, anisotropic functional properties of chiral molecular systems for a range of emerging technologies. The properties of chiral conjugated molecules, such as the absorption and/or emission of circularly polarized light or electron transport, are highly anisotropic. Now it has been shown that templating layers can control the orientation and anisotropic properties of small chiral molecules in bulk thin films useful for a range of emerging technologies.

Atomically precise organomimetic cluster nanomolecules assembled via perfluoroaryl-thiol SNAr chemistry

The majority of biomolecules are intrinsically atomically precise, an important characteristic that enables rational engineering of their recognition and binding properties. However, imparting a similar precision to hybrid nanoparticles has been challenging because of the inherent limitations of existing chemical methods and building blocks. Here we report a new approach to form atomically precise and highly tunable hybrid nanomolecules with well-defined three-dimensionality. Perfunctionalization of atomically precise clusters with pentafluoroaryl-terminated linkers produces size-tunable rigid cluster nanomolecules. These species are amenable to facile modification with a variety of thiol-containing molecules and macromolecules. Assembly proceeds at room temperature within hours under mild conditions, and the resulting nanomolecules exhibit high stabilities because of their full covalency. We further demonstrate how these nanomolecules grafted with saccharides can exhibit dramatically improved binding affinity towards a protein. Ultimately, the developed strategy allows the rapid generation of precise molecular assemblies to investigate multivalent interactions. The operational simplicity of modifying the surfaces of thiol-capped gold nanoparticles has been a hallmark of their success in materials chemistry, despite having limited control over the surface composition. Now, SNAr chemistry on activated perfluoroaromatics has been shown to mimic this simplicity and allow for the synthesis of atomically precise nanomolecules.

Controlled growth of high-density CdS and CdSe nanorod arrays on selective facets of two-dimensional semiconductor nanoplates

The rational synthesis of hierarchical three-dimensional nanostructures with specific compositions, morphologies and functionalities is important for applications in a variety of fields ranging from energy conversion and electronics to biotechnology. Here, we report a seeded growth approach for the controlled epitaxial growth of three types of hierarchical one-dimensional (1D)/two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures, where nanorod arrays of II–VI semiconductor CdS or CdSe are grown on the selective facets of hexagonal-shaped nanoplates, either on the two basal facets of the nanoplate, or on one basal facet, or on the two basal facets and six side facets. The seed engineering of 2D hexagonal-shaped nanoplates is the key factor for growth of the three resulting types of 1D/2D nanostructures. The wurtzite- and zinc-blende-type polymorphs of semiconductors are used to determine the facet-selective epitaxial growth of 1D nanorod arrays, resulting in the formation of different hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures. Controlling the morphology and composition of hybrid nanostructures is desirable for applications, but it has proven challenging to precisely combine different nucleation sites and growth modes. Now, three types of hierarchical 1D/2D nanostructures have been prepared by selectively growing semiconductor nanorod arrays (CdS or CdSe) on the different facets of hexagonal nanoplates.

Title: 
By-design enantioselective self-amplification based on non-covalent product–catalyst interactions

The synthesis of enantiomerically pure compounds is of great importance in pharmaceuticals, fragrances and biological applications, and functions as a key to many processes in nature. Asymmetric catalysis using enantiomerically pure catalysts represents an efficient synthetic method to achieve this goal. The enantiomeric excess of the reaction product correlates with the enantiomeric purity of the catalysts, except for nonlinear behaviour, therefore the use of stereochemically flexible catalysts seems to complicate the control of stereoselectivity. Self-amplifying catalytic reactions are attractive, but a general rational design is highly challenging. Here we show that product interaction with chiral recognition sites attached to structurally flexible phoshoramidite-type catalysts can sense the chirality and induce enantioselectivity in the catalyst. Structural flexibility along with sensing of the chirality of the product molecules results in a rapid increase of enantioselectivity of the dynamic catalysts (Δe.e. of up to 76%) and a shift out of equilibrium. In contrast to stereodynamic catalysts controlled with cleavable chiral auxiliaries, the enantioselectivity does not decrease. Methods for preparing enantiomerically enriched products are often dependent on the structure of a catalyst. Here, it is shown that a self-amplifying catalyst is able to ‘sense’ the chirality of the catalytic product and induce enantioselectivity. Flexible ligand and product interaction sites are key to the increasing enantioselectivity over the course of the reaction.

A synthetic redox biofilm made from metalloprotein–prion domain chimera nanowires

Engineering bioelectronic components and set-ups that mimic natural systems is extremely challenging. Here we report the design of a protein-only redox film inspired by the architecture of bacterial electroactive biofilms. The nanowire scaffold is formed using a chimeric protein that results from the attachment of a prion domain to a rubredoxin (Rd) that acts as an electron carrier. The prion domain self-assembles into stable fibres and provides a suitable arrangement of redox metal centres in Rd to permit electron transport. This results in highly organized films, able to transport electrons over several micrometres through a network of bionanowires. We demonstrate that our bionanowires can be used as electron-transfer mediators to build a bioelectrode for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction by laccase. This approach opens opportunities for the engineering of protein-only electron mediators (with tunable redox potentials and optimized interactions with enzymes) and applications in the field of protein-only bioelectrodes. A protein-only redox film inspired by the architecture of bacterial electroactive biofilms has been developed. The film is formed using a rubredoxin–prion domain chimeric protein. The prion domains self-assemble into fibres that are decorated with rubredoxin. This results in highly organized films, able to transport electrons over several microns, and wire enzymes to electrodes.

Visible-light excitation of iminium ions enables the enantioselective catalytic β-alkylation of enals

Chiral iminium ions—generated upon condensation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and amine catalysts—are used extensively by chemists to make chiral molecules in enantioenriched form. In contrast, their potential to absorb light and promote stereocontrolled photochemical processes remains unexplored. This is despite the fact that visible-light absorption by iminium ions is a naturally occurring event that triggers the mechanism of vision in higher organisms. Herein we demonstrate that the direct excitation of chiral iminium ions can unlock unconventional reaction pathways, enabling enantioselective catalytic photochemical β-alkylations of enals that cannot be realized via thermal activation. The chemistry uses readily available alkyl silanes, which are recalcitrant to classical conjugate additions, and occurs under illumination by visible-light-emitting diodes. Crucial to success was the design of a chiral amine catalyst with well-tailored electronic properties that can generate a photo-active iminium ion while providing the source of stereochemical induction. This strategy is expected to offer new opportunities for reaction design in the field of enantioselective catalytic photochemistry. Chiral iminium ions generated from an amine catalyst and enals are key organocatalytic intermediates in thermal asymmetric processes. Now, visible-light excitation of these iminium ions can turn these compounds into strong oxidants to enable enantioselective photochemical β-alkylations of enals with silanes, which are unachievable via conventional ground state pathways.

Coulomb explosion during the early stages of the reaction of alkali metals with water

Alkali metals can react explosively with water and it is textbook knowledge that this vigorous behaviour results from heat release, steam formation and ignition of the hydrogen gas that is produced. Here we suggest that the initial process enabling the alkali metal explosion in water is, however, of a completely different nature. High-speed camera imaging of liquid drops of a sodium/potassium alloy in water reveals submillisecond formation of metal spikes that protrude from the surface of the drop. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that on immersion in water there is an almost immediate release of electrons from the metal surface. The system thus quickly reaches the Rayleigh instability limit, which leads to a ‘coulomb explosion’ of the alkali metal drop. Consequently, a new metal surface in contact with water is formed, which explains why the reaction does not become self-quenched by its products, but can rather lead to explosive behaviour. The explosion of alkali metals in water is a typical high-school chemistry experiment, but its mechanism is not fully understood. Using high-speed cameras and molecular simulations it is now shown that a key early step in this reaction is the migration of electrons from the alkali metal into water, leading to a charging of the metal's surface and subsequent Coulomb explosion.

Non-oxidative intercalation and exfoliation of graphite by Brønsted acids

Graphite intercalation compounds are formed by inserting guest molecules or ions between sp2-bonded carbon layers. These compounds are interesting as synthetic metals and as precursors to graphene. For many decades it has been thought that graphite intercalation must involve host–guest charge transfer, resulting in partial oxidation, reduction or covalent modification of the graphene sheets. Here, we revisit this concept and show that graphite can be reversibly intercalated by non-oxidizing Brønsted acids (phosphoric, sulfuric, dichloroacetic and alkylsulfonic acids). The products are mixtures of graphite and first-stage intercalation compounds. X-ray photoelectron and vibrational spectra indicate that the graphene layers are not oxidized or reduced in the intercalation process. These observations are supported by density functional theory calculations, which indicate a dipolar interaction between the guest molecules and the polarizable graphene sheets. The intercalated graphites readily exfoliate in dimethylformamide to give suspensions of crystalline single- and few-layer graphene sheets. Intercalation in graphite is generally driven by partial oxidation or reduction of the graphene sheets. Now, it has been shown that graphite microcrystals can be intercalated by Brønsted acids by heating a liquid suspension to dryness. The intercalated acid molecules interact weakly with the carbon sheets but assist in their exfoliation to single- and few-layer graphene.

UV-light-driven prebiotic synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters

Iron–sulfur clusters are ancient cofactors that play a fundamental role in metabolism and may have impacted the prebiotic chemistry that led to life. However, it is unclear whether iron–sulfur clusters could have been synthesized on prebiotic Earth. Dissolved iron on early Earth was predominantly in the reduced ferrous state, but ferrous ions alone cannot form polynuclear iron–sulfur clusters. Similarly, free sulfide may not have been readily available. Here we show that UV light drives the synthesis of [2Fe–2S] and [4Fe–4S] clusters through the photooxidation of ferrous ions and the photolysis of organic thiols. Iron–sulfur clusters coordinate to and are stabilized by a wide range of cysteine-containing peptides and the assembly of iron–sulfur cluster-peptide complexes can take place within model protocells in a process that parallels extant pathways. Our experiments suggest that iron–sulfur clusters may have formed easily on early Earth, facilitating the emergence of an iron–sulfur-cluster-dependent metabolism. Current mineral-based theories do not fully address how enzymes emerged from prebiotic catalysts. Now, iron–sulfur clusters can be synthesized by UV-light-mediated photolysis of organic thiols and photooxidation of ferrous ions. Iron–sulfur peptides may have formed easily on early Earth, facilitating the emergence of iron–sulfur-cluster-dependent metabolism.

Through-space transfer of chiral information mediated by a plasmonic nanomaterial

The ability to detect chirality gives stereochemically attuned nanosensors the potential to revolutionize the study of biomolecular processes. Such devices may structurally characterize the mechanisms of protein–ligand binding, the intermediates of amyloidogenic diseases and the effects of phosphorylation and glycosylation. We demonstrate that single nanoparticle plasmonic reporters, or nanotags, can enable a stereochemical response to be transmitted from a chiral analyte to an achiral benzotriazole dye molecule in the vicinity of a plasmon resonance from an achiral metallic nanostructure. The transfer of chirality was verified by the measurement of mirror image surface enhanced resonance Raman optical activity spectra for the two enantiomers of both ribose and tryptophan. Computational modelling confirms these observations and reveals the novel chirality transfer mechanism responsible. This is the first report of colloidal metal nanoparticles in the form of single plasmonic substrates displaying an intrinsic chiral sensitivity once attached to a chiral molecule. Surface-enhanced resonant Raman optical activity (SERROA) reveals the through-space transfer of chirality from biomolecules to achiral benzotriazole dye-conjugated nanotags. The chiroptical responses generated by the stereoisomers of ribose and tryptophan establish this as the basis for a stereoselective nanosensor platform.

A two-coordinate boron cation featuring C–B+–C bonding

Two-coordinate boron cations (R2B+), referred to as borinium ions, are chemical species in which the boron bears only four valence electrons, and that are isoelectronic with hypothetical carbon dications (R2C2+). Although lone-pair-donating substituents such as amino groups have enabled the isolation of several borinium ions, diarylated and dialkylated borinium derivatives remain entirely unexplored. Here, we present the synthesis, structure and reactivity of the dimesitylborinium ion, which displays unexpectedly high thermal stability. X-ray crystallography and 11B NMR spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory calculations, reveal that the borinium ion adopts a linear two-coordinate structure in both the solid state and in solution. The boron centre is stabilized by pπ bonding from the mesityl groups and is free from coordination by the counterion or solvent molecules. This diarylborinium ion possesses exceptional Lewis acidity, accepting a pair of electrons from CO2 to cause an unusual deoxygenation reaction. Borinium ions are two-coordinate boron cations that contain only four valence electrons on boron, and are difficult to isolate without electron donation from adjacent heteroatoms. Now, diarylborinium salts with no lone-pair donation from heteroatoms have been isolated, characterized and found to participate in an unusual reaction with CO2.

Rhodanine hydrolysis leads to potent thioenolate mediated metallo-β-lactamase inhibition

The use of β-lactam antibiotics is compromised by resistance, which is provided by β-lactamases belonging to both metallo (MBL)- and serine (SBL)-β-lactamase subfamilies. The rhodanines are one of very few compound classes that inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), SBLs and, as recently reported, MBLs. Here, we describe crystallographic analyses of the mechanism of inhibition of the clinically relevant VIM-2 MBL by a rhodanine, which reveal that the rhodanine ring undergoes hydrolysis to give a thioenolate. The thioenolate is found to bind via di-zinc chelation, mimicking the binding of intermediates in β-lactam hydrolysis. Crystallization of VIM-2 in the presence of the intact rhodanine led to observation of a ternary complex of MBL, a thioenolate fragment and rhodanine. The crystallographic observations are supported by kinetic and biophysical studies, including 19F NMR analyses, which reveal the rhodanine-derived thioenolate to be a potent broad-spectrum MBL inhibitor and a lead structure for the development of new types of clinically useful MBL inhibitors. The use of β-lactam antibiotics is severely threatened by metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), which contribute to the development of resistance. Now, crystallographic and solution studies reveal that recently reported MBL inhibition with a rhodanine can be attributed to fragmentation and complex formation with the resulting thioenolate.

Catalytic living ring-opening metathesis polymerization

In living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), a transition-metal–carbene complex polymerizes ring-strained olefins with very good control of the molecular weight of the resulting polymers. Because one molecule of the initiator is required for each polymer chain, however, this type of polymerization is expensive for widespread use. We have now designed a chain-transfer agent (CTA) capable of reducing the required amount of metal complex while still maintaining full control over the living polymerization process. This new method introduces a degenerative transfer process to ROMP. We demonstrate that substituted cyclohexene rings are good CTAs, and thereby preserve the ‘living’ character of the polymerization using catalytic quantities of the metal complex. The resulting polymers show characteristics of a living polymerization, namely narrow molecular-weight distribution, controlled molecular weights and block copolymer formation. This new technique provides access to well-defined polymers for industrial, biomedical and academic use at a fraction of the current costs and significantly reduced levels of residual ruthenium catalyst. Ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) offers good control over dispersity, but the requirement of one initiator per chain can be expensive and problematic for purification. Now, a reversible cyclohexenyl-containing chain-transfer agent is described, thus allowing a catalytic living ROMP process to produce narrow dispersity polymers and block copolymers.

Phase-separating peptides for direct cytosolic delivery and redox-activated release of macromolecular therapeutics

Biomacromolecules are highly promising therapeutic modalities to treat various diseases. However, they suffer from poor cellular membrane permeability, limiting their access to intracellular targets. Strategies to overcome this challenge often employ nanoscale carriers that can get trapped in endosomal compartments. Here we report conjugated peptides that form pH- and redox-responsive coacervate microdroplets by liquid–liquid phase separation that readily cross the cell membrane. A wide range of macromolecules can be quickly recruited within the microdroplets, including small peptides, enzymes as large as 430 kDa and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The therapeutic-loaded coacervates bypass classical endocytic pathways to enter the cytosol, where they undergo glutathione-mediated release of payload, the bioactivity of which is retained in the cell, while mRNAs exhibit a high transfection efficiency. These peptide coacervates represent a promising platform for the intracellular delivery of a large palette of macromolecular therapeutics that have potential for treating various pathologies (for example, cancers and metabolic diseases) or as carriers for mRNA-based vaccines. Coacervate microdroplets formed from pH- and redox-responsive peptides and self-assembled by liquid–liquid phase separation have been shown to quickly recruit macromolecular therapeutics—such as peptides, large proteins and mRNAs—and directly enter the cytosol of cells via a non-endocytic pathway. The subsequent release of therapeutic cargo is mediated by endogenic glutathione.

Direct α-C–H bond functionalization of unprotected cyclic amines

Cyclic amines are ubiquitous core structures of bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical drugs. Although the site-selective abstraction of C–H bonds is an attractive strategy for preparing valuable functionalized amines from their readily available parent heterocycles, this approach has largely been limited to substrates that require protection of the amine nitrogen atom. In addition, most methods rely on transition metals and are incompatible with the presence of amine N–H bonds. Here we introduce a protecting-group-free approach for the α-functionalization of cyclic secondary amines. An operationally simple one-pot procedure generates products via a process that involves intermolecular hydride transfer to generate an imine intermediate that is subsequently captured by a nucleophile, such as an alkyl or aryl lithium compound. Reactions are regioselective and stereospecific and enable the rapid preparation of bioactive amines, as exemplified by the facile synthesis of anabasine and (–)-solenopsin A. Cyclic amines bearing α-substituents are valuable building blocks for drug discovery and natural product synthesis. Introduction of α-substituents via site-selective replacement of C–H bonds is highly attractive but typically limited to protected amine substrates. Now, an operationally simple hydride-transfer-based approach enables the introduction of α-substituents on unprotected amines.

A supramolecular ruthenium macrocycle with high catalytic activity for water oxidation that mechanistically mimics photosystem II

Mimicking the ingenuity of nature and exploiting the billions of years over which natural selection has developed numerous effective biochemical conversions is one of the most successful strategies in a chemist's toolbox. However, an inability to replicate the elegance and efficiency of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (OEC-PSII) in its oxidation of water into O2 is a significant bottleneck in the development of a closed-loop sustainable energy cycle. Here, we present an artificial metallosupramolecular macrocycle that gathers three Ru(bda) centres (bda = 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-dicarboxylic acid) that catalyses water oxidation. The macrocyclic architecture accelerates the rate of water oxidation via a water nucleophilic attack mechanism, similar to the mechanism exhibited by OEC-PSII, and reaches remarkable catalytic turnover frequencies &gt;100 s–1. Photo-driven water oxidation yields outstanding activity, even in the nM concentration regime, with a turnover number of &gt;1,255 and turnover frequency of &gt;13.1 s–1. Designing improved catalysts is predicated on understanding how they work. Now, by positioning three ruthenium centres in a macrocyclic framework, a remarkable acceleration of catalytic water oxidation has been achieved. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the catalyst operates through the ‘water nucleophilic attack’ pathway—similar to the natural oxygen-evolving cluster of photosystem II.

Title: 
Emergence of a catalytic tetrad during evolution of a highly active artificial aldolase

Designing catalysts that achieve the rates and selectivities of natural enzymes is a long-standing goal in protein chemistry. Here, we show that an ultrahigh-throughput droplet-based microfluidic screening platform can be used to improve a previously optimized artificial aldolase by an additional factor of 30 to give a &gt;109 rate enhancement that rivals the efficiency of class I aldolases. The resulting enzyme catalyses a reversible aldol reaction with high stereoselectivity and tolerates a broad range of substrates. Biochemical and structural studies show that catalysis depends on a Lys-Tyr-Asn-Tyr tetrad that emerged adjacent to a computationally designed hydrophobic pocket during directed evolution. This constellation of residues is poised to activate the substrate by Schiff base formation, promote mechanistically important proton transfers and stabilize multiple transition states along a complex reaction coordinate. The emergence of such a sophisticated catalytic centre shows that there is nothing magical about the catalytic activities or mechanisms of naturally occurring enzymes, or the evolutionary process that gave rise to them. An artificial aldolase has been optimized using an ultrahigh-throughput microfluidic screening assay. The evolved enzyme exhibits excellent stereoselectivity and broad substrate scope. Structural studies suggest that a Lys-Tyr-Asn-Tyr catalytic tetrad, which emerged during directed evolution, is responsible for the &gt;109 rate enhancement achieved by this catalyst.

Title: 
Caesium in high oxidation states and as a p-block element

The periodicity of the elements and the non-reactivity of the inner-shell electrons are two related principles of chemistry, rooted in the atomic shell structure. Within compounds, Group I elements, for example, invariably assume the +1 oxidation state, and their chemical properties differ completely from those of the p-block elements. These general rules govern our understanding of chemical structures and reactions. Here, first-principles calculations show that, under pressure, caesium atoms can share their 5p electrons to become formally oxidized beyond the +1 state. In the presence of fluorine and under pressure, the formation of CsFn (n&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1) compounds containing neutral or ionic molecules is predicted. Their geometry and bonding resemble that of isoelectronic XeFn molecules, showing a caesium atom that behaves chemically like a p-block element under these conditions. The calculated stability of the CsFn compounds shows that the inner-shell electrons can become the main components of chemical bonds. Caesium has so far not been found in oxidation states higher than +1, but quantum chemical calculations have now shown that, under high pressures, 5p inner shell electrons of caesium can participate in — and become the main components of — bonds. Caesium is predicted to form stable CsFn molecules that resemble isoelectronic XeFn.

The dipolar endofullerene HF@C60

The cavity inside fullerenes provides a unique environment for the study of isolated atoms and molecules. We report the encapsulation of hydrogen fluoride inside C60 using molecular surgery to give the endohedral fullerene HF@C60. The key synthetic step is the closure of the open fullerene cage with the escape of HF minimized. The encapsulated HF molecule moves freely inside the cage and exhibits quantization of its translational and rotational degrees of freedom, as revealed by inelastic neutron scattering and infrared spectroscopy. The rotational and vibrational constants of the encapsulated HF molecules were found to be redshifted relative to free HF. The NMR spectra display a large 1H–19F J coupling typical of an isolated species. The dipole moment of HF@C60 was estimated from the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant at cryogenic temperatures and showed that the cage shields around 75% of the HF dipole. Hydrogen fluoride has been encapsulated in C60-fullerene using molecular surgery. The quantum rotor system has been studied by NMR and infrared spectroscopy as well as neutron scattering. The fullerene cage causes a small red-shift in the HF rotational and vibrational constants, and shields around 75% of its dipole.

In situ mapping of the energy flow through the entire photosynthetic apparatus

Absorption of sunlight is the first step in photosynthesis, which provides energy for the vast majority of organisms on Earth. The primary processes of photosynthesis have been studied extensively in isolated light-harvesting complexes and reaction centres, however, to understand fully the way in which organisms capture light it is crucial to also reveal the functional relationships between the individual complexes. Here we report the use of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to track directly the excitation-energy flow through the entire photosynthetic system of green sulfur bacteria. We unravel the functional organization of individual complexes in the photosynthetic unit and show that, whereas energy is transferred within subunits on a timescale of subpicoseconds to a few picoseconds, across the complexes the energy flows at a timescale of tens of picoseconds. Thus, we demonstrate that the bottleneck of energy transfer is between the constituents. Effective light capture in photosynthetic organisms depends on the efficiency of all energy-transfer steps in the photosynthetic unit. Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy has now been used on intact cells in situ to reveal and characterize the functional connectivity between individual complexes in the photosynthetic apparatus of green sulfur bacteria.

Title: 
Iron sensitizer converts light to electrons with 92% yield

Solar energy conversion in photovoltaics or photocatalysis involves light harvesting, or sensitization, of a semiconductor or catalyst as a first step. Rare elements are frequently used for this purpose, but they are obviously not ideal for large-scale implementation. Great efforts have been made to replace the widely used ruthenium with more abundant analogues like iron, but without much success due to the very short-lived excited states of the resulting iron complexes. Here, we describe the development of an iron–nitrogen–heterocyclic-carbene sensitizer with an excited-state lifetime that is nearly a thousand-fold longer than that of traditional iron polypyridyl complexes. By the use of electron paramagnetic resonance, transient absorption spectroscopy, transient terahertz spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations, we show that the iron complex generates photoelectrons in the conduction band of titanium dioxide with a quantum yield of 92% from the 3MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) state. These results open up possibilities to develop solar energy-converting materials based on abundant elements. Using iron instead of the scarce ruthenium in light-harvesting complexes is challenging because iron complexes generally have short-lived excited states. Now an iron complex has been developed that has a long-lived excited state, which can lead to photo-induced electron injection into nanoporous TiO2 with a yield of 92%.

Title: 
Enantioselective aldol reactions with masked fluoroacetates

Despite the growing importance of organofluorines as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, the stereoselective introduction of fluorine into many prominent classes of natural products and chemotherapeutic agents is difficult. One long-standing unsolved challenge is the enantioselective aldol reaction of fluoroacetate to enable access to fluorinated analogues of medicinally relevant acetate-derived compounds, such as polyketides and statins. Herein we present fluoromalonic acid halfthioesters as biomimetic surrogates of fluoroacetate and demonstrate their use in highly stereoselective aldol reactions that proceed under mild organocatalytic conditions. We also show that the methodology can be extended to formal aldol reactions with fluoroacetaldehyde and consecutive aldol reactions. The synthetic utility of the fluorinated aldol products is illustrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated derivative of the top-selling drug atorvastatin. The results show the prospects of the method for the enantioselective introduction of fluoroacetate to access a wide variety of highly functionalized fluorinated compounds. Enantioselective aldol reactions with fluoroacetate would enable access to numerous fluorinated analogues of therapeutically important compounds but have been a long-standing unsolved challenge. Now, bioinspired fluoromalonic acid half thioesters (F-MAHTs) have been devised and allow for highly stereoselective reactions with aldehydes under mild organocatalytic conditions.

Title: 
A reductive aminase from Aspergillus oryzae

Reductive amination is one of the most important methods for the synthesis of chiral amines. Here we report the discovery of an NADP(H)-dependent reductive aminase from Aspergillus oryzae (AspRedAm, Uniprot code Q2TW47) that can catalyse the reductive coupling of a broad set of carbonyl compounds with a variety of primary and secondary amines with up to &gt;98% conversion and with up to &gt;98% enantiomeric excess. In cases where both carbonyl and amine show high reactivity, it is possible to employ a 1:1 ratio of the substrates, forming amine products with up to 94% conversion. Steady-state kinetic studies establish that the enzyme is capable of catalysing imine formation as well as reduction. Crystal structures of AspRedAm in complex with NADP(H) and also with both NADP(H) and the pharmaceutical ingredient (R)-rasagiline are reported. We also demonstrate preparative scale reductive aminations with wild-type and Q240A variant biocatalysts displaying total turnover numbers of up to 32,000 and space time yields up to 3.73 g l−1 d−1. An enzyme (AspRedAm) capable of coupling carbonyls with a variety of amines in a reductive amination has now been discovered. Kinetic studies revealed that the enzyme catalysed both the imine formation step, as well as the reduction step. Structure and mutagenesis studies have highlighted essential catalytic residues and preparative scale examples have demonstrated total turnover numbers of up to 32,000.

Title: 
Single-crystal-to-single-crystal intercalation of a low-bandgap superatomic crystal

The controlled introduction of impurities into the crystal lattice of solid-state compounds is a cornerstone of materials science. Intercalation, the insertion of guest atoms, ions or molecules between the atomic layers of a host structure, can produce novel electronic, magnetic and optical properties in many materials. Here we describe an intercalation compound in which the host [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3, formed from the binary assembly of atomically precise molecular clusters, is a superatomic analogue of traditional layered atomic compounds. We find that tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) can be inserted into the superstructure through a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. Using electronic absorption spectroscopy, electrical transport measurements and electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that the intercalation is driven by the exchange of charge between the host [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3 and the intercalant TCNE. These results show that intercalation is a powerful approach to manipulate the material properties of superatomic crystals. Intercalation — a cornerstone of materials science with wide-ranging applications — has now been demonstrated in a superatomic crystal. A redox-active tetracyanoethylene guest was inserted into the lattice of a material consisting of alternate layers of {Co6Te8} clusters and C60 fullerenes, leading to a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation that significantly modulates the material's optical and electrical transport properties.

Prebiotic synthesis of phosphoenol pyruvate by α-phosphorylation-controlled triose glycolysis

Phosphoenol pyruvate is the highest-energy phosphate found in living organisms and is one of the most versatile molecules in metabolism. Consequently, it is an essential intermediate in a wide variety of biochemical pathways, including carbon fixation, the shikimate pathway, substrate-level phosphorylation, gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Triose glycolysis (generation of ATP from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate via phosphoenol pyruvate) is among the most central and highly conserved pathways in metabolism. Here, we demonstrate the efficient and robust synthesis of phosphoenol pyruvate from prebiotic nucleotide precursors, glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde. Furthermore, phosphoenol pyruvate is derived within an α-phosphorylation controlled reaction network that gives access to glyceric acid 2-phosphate, glyceric acid 3-phosphate, phosphoserine and pyruvate. Our results demonstrate that the key components of a core metabolic pathway central to energy transduction and amino acid, sugar, nucleotide and lipid biosyntheses can be reconstituted in high yield under mild, prebiotically plausible conditions. Chemical reconstitution of the triose glycolysis pathway is controlled by α-phosphorylation and provides a generational link between prebiotic ribonucleotide synthesis, triose glycolysis and serine metabolism. Now, research suggests that unification of nucleotide synthesis and triose metabolism may have been a fundamentally important step towards the origins of life.

Visualization and selective chemical targeting of RNA G-quadruplex structures in the cytoplasm of human cells

Following extensive evidence for the formation of four-stranded DNA G-quadruplex structures in vitro, DNA G-quadruplexes have been observed within human cells. Although chemically distinct, RNA can also fold in vitro into G-quadruplex structures that are highly stable because of the 2′-hydroxyl group. However, RNA G-quadruplexes have not yet been reported in cells. Here, we demonstrate the visualization of RNA G-quadruplex structures within the cytoplasm of human cells using a G-quadruplex structure-specific antibody. We also demonstrate that small molecules that bind to G-quadruplexes in vitro can trap endogenous RNA G-quadruplexes when applied to cells. Furthermore, a small molecule that exhibits a preference for RNA G-quadruplexes rather than DNA G-quadruplexes in biophysical experiments also shows the same selectivity within a cellular context. Our findings provide substantive evidence for RNA G-quadruplex formation in the human transcriptome, and corroborate the selectivity and application of stabilizing ligands that target G-quadruplexes within a cellular context. The presence of RNA G-quadruplex structures in human cells using a structure-specific antibody is demonstrated. Using small molecules, the selective stabilization of cytoplasmic RNA G-quadruplexes versus nuclear DNA G-quadruplexes is demonstrated. These findings validate the existence of RNA G-quadruplexes and their specific targeting by small molecules within a cellular context.

Highly branched and loop-rich gels via formation of metal–organic cages linked by polymers

Gels formed via metal–ligand coordination typically have very low branch functionality, f, as they consist of ∼2–3 polymer chains linked to single metal ions that serve as junctions. Thus, these materials are very soft and unable to withstand network defects such as dangling ends and loops. We report here a new class of gels assembled from polymeric ligands and metal–organic cages (MOCs) as junctions. The resulting ‘polyMOC’ gels are precisely tunable and may feature increased branch functionality. We show two examples of such polyMOCs: a gel with a low f based on a M2L4 paddlewheel cluster junction and a compositionally isomeric one of higher f based on a M12L24 cage. The latter features large shear moduli, but also a very large number of elastically inactive loop defects that we subsequently exchanged for functional ligands, with no impact on the gel's shear modulus. Such a ligand substitution is not possible in gels of low f, including the M2L4-based polyMOC. Gels formed by metal–ligand coordination typically consist of single metal ions linked together by polymer chains. Now, metal–organic cages have been used as junctions instead. A gel was prepared that features a large number of polymer chains at each junction, including loops that further serve to functionalize the material.

A spontaneously blinking fluorophore based on intramolecular spirocyclization for live-cell super-resolution imaging

Single-molecule localization microscopy is used to construct super-resolution images, but generally requires prior intense laser irradiation and in some cases additives, such as thiols, to induce on–off switching of fluorophores. These requirements limit the potential applications of this methodology. Here, we report a first-in-class spontaneously blinking fluorophore based on an intramolecular spirocyclization reaction. Optimization of the intramolecular nucleophile and rhodamine-based fluorophore (electrophile) provide a suitable lifetime for the fluorescent open form, and equilibrium between the open form and the non-fluorescent closed form. We show that this spontaneously blinking fluorophore is suitable for single-molecule localization microscopy imaging deep inside cells and for tracking the motion of structures in living cells. We further demonstrate the advantages of this fluorophore over existing methodologies by applying it to nuclear pore structures located far above the coverslip with a spinning-disk confocal microscope and for repetitive time-lapse super-resolution imaging of microtubules in live cells for up to 1 h. A self-blinking fluorophore suitable for super-resolution imaging has been developed. The blinking arises from a reversible intramolecular spirocyclization in a rhodamine-based fluorophore that switches between a fluorescent open form and a non-fluorescent closed form. The advantages over existing methodologies are demonstrated using single-molecule localization microscopy imaging inside cells.

Title: 
Post-translational modification of ribosomally synthesized peptides by a radical SAM epimerase in Bacillus subtilis

Ribosomally synthesized peptides are built out of L-amino acids, whereas D-amino acids are generally the hallmark of non-ribosomal synthetic processes. Here we show that the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis is able to produce a novel type of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide that contains D-amino acids, and which we propose to call epipeptides. We demonstrate that a two [4Fe–4S]-cluster radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzyme converts L-amino acids into their D-counterparts by catalysing Cα-hydrogen-atom abstraction and using a critical cysteine residue as the hydrogen-atom donor. Unexpectedly, these D-amino acid residues proved to be essential for the activity of a peptide that induces the expression of LiaRS, a major component of the bacterial cell envelope stress-response system. Present in B. subtilis and in several members of the human microbiome, these epipeptides and radical SAM epimerases broaden the landscape of peptidyl structures accessible to living organisms. Radical SAM enzymes are versatile enzymes catalysing chemically challenging reactions. Now, a radical SAM enzyme that post-translationally modifies ribosomally synthesized peptides to contain D-amino acids has been discovered in Bacillus subtilis, and its mechanism has been deciphered. These peptides, called epipeptides, efficiently inhibit bacterial growth.

Living supramolecular polymerization realized through a biomimetic approach

Various conventional reactions in polymer chemistry have been translated to the supramolecular domain, yet it has remained challenging to devise living supramolecular polymerization. To achieve this, self-organization occurring far from thermodynamic equilibrium—ubiquitously observed in nature—must take place. Prion infection is one example that can be observed in biological systems. Here, we present an ‘artificial infection’ process in which porphyrin-based monomers assemble into nanoparticles, and are then converted into nanofibres in the presence of an aliquot of the nanofibre, which acts as a ‘pathogen’. We have investigated the assembly phenomenon using isodesmic and cooperative models and found that it occurs through a delicate interplay of these two aggregation pathways. Using this understanding of the mechanism taking place, we have designed a living supramolecular polymerization of the porphyrin-based monomers. Despite the fact that the polymerization is non-covalent, the reaction kinetics are analogous to that of conventional chain growth polymerization, and the supramolecular polymers were synthesized with controlled length and narrow polydispersity. Self-organization that occurs far from thermodynamic equilibrium is ubiquitous in nature but has remained challenging to control in synthetic supramolecular systems. A complex system has now been devised that displays such behaviour. Porphyrin derivative monomers undergo living supramolecular polymerization, a reaction underpinned by the interplay of two supramolecular polymerization pathways.

Single-nanoparticle phase transitions visualized by four-dimensional electron microscopy

The advancement of techniques that can probe the behaviour of individual nanoscopic objects is of paramount importance in various disciplines, including photonics and electronics. As it provides images with a spatiotemporal resolution, four-dimensional electron microscopy, in principle, should enable the visualization of single-nanoparticle structural dynamics in real and reciprocal space. Here, we demonstrate the selectivity and sensitivity of the technique by visualizing the spin crossover dynamics of single, isolated metal–organic framework nanocrystals. By introducing a small aperture in the microscope, it was possible to follow the phase transition and the associated structural dynamics within a single particle. Its behaviour was observed to be distinct from that imaged by averaging over ensembles of heterogeneous nanoparticles. The approach reported here has potential applications in other nanosystems and those that undergo (bio)chemical transformations. Introducing a small aperture in a 4D electron microscope has enabled researchers to visualize the phase transition of a single metal–organic framework particle with excellent spatio-temporal resolution. The spin-crossover dynamics of one nanoparticle are found to be distinct from those observed for an ensemble of heterogeneous nanoparticles.

Introducing structural sensitivity into adsorption–energy scaling relations by means of coordination numbers

The search for improved heterogeneous catalysts is an important but difficult task. Scaling relations between the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates greatly facilitate the computational design of catalysts. However, this methodology does not currently incorporate structure sensitivity and hence cannot describe adequately the overall activity of realistic catalyst particles and extended surfaces with several facets, edges and apices. Here, we generalize scaling relations by examining twelve different low-index, stepped and kinked surfaces of nine transition metals. This allows us to quantify the effect of the adsorption-site geometry on these relations, ensures a full prediction of their parameters, and helps in identifying intrinsic thermodynamic restrictions to the performance of catalysts. The resulting fully predictable, structure-sensitive scaling relations are a step towards the long-sought rational design of multifaceted catalytic particles. Such a design can now target not only the chemical nature of active materials but also the actual geometry of their active sites. Scaling relations between the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates facilitate the computational design of catalysts. However, these relations are restricted to low-index surfaces and how they differ from surface to surface cannot be predicted. Structural sensitivity has now been incorporated into scaling relations by elucidating how they are affected by the coordination number of an adsorption site.

Infrared spectrum and structure of the homochiral serine octamer–dichloride complex

The amino acid serine is known to form a very stable octamer that has properties that set it apart from serine complexes of different sizes or from complexes composed of other amino acids. For example, both singly protonated serine octamers and anionic octamers complexed with two halogen ions strongly prefer homochirality, even when assembled from racemic D,L mixtures. Consequently, the structures of these complexes are of great interest, but no acceptable candidates have so far been identified. Here, we investigate anionic serine octamers coordinated with two chloride ions using a novel technique coupling ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry with infrared spectroscopy, in combination with theoretical calculations. The results allow the identification of a unique structure for (Ser8Cl2)2− that is highly symmetric, very stable and homochiral and whose calculated properties match those observed in experiments. Octameric complexes of serine are long known for their special properties, such as their enhanced stability and preference for homochirality. Yet, there is no consensus on their structures. Now, experimental data on the serine octamer–dichloride complex is presented that supports a highly symmetrical, highly stable structure.

Title: 
Heat flux across an open pore enables the continuous replication and selection of oligonucleotides towards increasing length

The replication of nucleic acids is central to the origin of life. On the early Earth, suitable non-equilibrium boundary conditions would have been required to surmount the effects of thermodynamic equilibrium such as the dilution and degradation of oligonucleotides. One particularly intractable experimental finding is that short genetic polymers replicate faster and outcompete longer ones, which leads to ever shorter sequences and the loss of genetic information. Here we show that a heat flux across an open pore in submerged rock concentrates replicating oligonucleotides from a constant feeding flow and selects for longer strands. Our experiments utilize the interplay of molecular thermophoresis and laminar convection, the latter driving strand separation and exponential replication. Strands of 75 nucleotides survive whereas strands half as long die out, which inverts the above dilemma of the survival of the shortest. The combined feeding, thermal cycling and positive length selection opens the door for a stable molecular evolution in the long-term microhabitat of heated porous rock. How complex nucleic acids originally formed, despite dilution and degradation reactions, is not clear. Thermal gradients in rock pores have now been shown to be capable of trapping and thermo-cycling genetic polymers during replication. In this system long oligonucleotide strands are seen to outcompete short strands — a prerequisite for the evolution of replicating systems towards increasing complexity.

Title: 
A simple physical mechanism enables homeostasis in primitive cells

The emergence of homeostatic mechanisms that enable maintenance of an intracellular steady state during growth was critical to the advent of cellular life. Here, we show that concentration-dependent reversible binding of short oligonucleotides, of both specific and random sequence, can modulate ribozyme activity. In both cases, catalysis is inhibited at high concentrations, and dilution activates the ribozyme via inhibitor dissociation, thus maintaining near-constant ribozyme specific activity throughout protocell growth. To mimic the result of RNA synthesis within non-growing protocells, we co-encapsulated high concentrations of ribozyme and oligonucleotides within fatty acid vesicles, and ribozyme activity was inhibited. Following vesicle growth, the resulting internal dilution produced ribozyme activation. This simple physical system enables a primitive homeostatic behaviour: the maintenance of constant ribozyme activity per unit volume during protocell volume changes. We suggest that such systems, wherein short oligonucleotides reversibly inhibit functional RNAs, could have preceded sophisticated modern RNA regulatory mechanisms, such as those involving miRNAs. The development of cells requires a mechanism to support homeostasis—the maintenance of constant internal conditions—as cellular growth results in internal dilution. Now, a simple physical process is described in which short oligonucleotide inhibitors enable dilution-driven activation of encapsulated ribozymes via membrane growth, suggesting homeostatic mechanisms could have existed in the earliest cells.

A device that operates within a self-assembled 3D DNA crystal

Structural DNA nanotechnology finds applications in numerous areas, but the construction of objects, 2D and 3D crystalline lattices and devices is prominent among them. Each of these components has been developed individually, and most of them have been combined in pairs. However, to date there are no reports of independent devices contained within 3D crystals. Here we report a three-state 3D device whereby we change the colour of the crystals by diffusing strands that contain dyes in or out of the crystals through the mother-liquor component of the system. Each colouring strand is designed to pair with an extended triangle strand by Watson–Crick base pairing. The arm that contains the dyes is quite flexible, but it is possible to establish the presence of the duplex proximal to the triangle by X-ray crystallography. We modelled the transition between the red and blue states through a simple kinetic model. Although DNA nanotechnology has found many applications in developing functional structures, there has never been an independent device contained within a 3D crystal. Now, a self-assembled three-state device that can change the colour of its crystal by diffusion of DNA-ligated dyes has been reported, representing the potential to develop programmable nanomechanical devices.

G-quadruplex organic frameworks

Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks often π stack into crystalline solids that allow precise spatial positioning of molecular building blocks. Inspired by the hydrogen-bonded G-quadruplexes found frequently in guanine-rich DNA, here we show that this structural motif can be exploited to guide the self-assembly of naphthalene diimide and perylene diimide electron acceptors end-capped with two guanine electron donors into crystalline G-quadruplex-based organic frameworks, wherein the electron donors and acceptors form ordered, segregated π-stacked arrays. Time-resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies show that photogenerated holes and electrons in the frameworks have long lifetimes and display recombination kinetics typical of dissociated charge carriers. Moreover, the reduced acceptors form polarons in which the electron is shared over several molecules. The G-quadruplex frameworks also demonstrate potential as cathode materials in Li-ion batteries because of the favourable electron- and Li-ion-transporting capacity provided by the ordered rylene diimide arrays and G-quadruplex structures, respectively. Using self-assembly to generate hydrogen-bonded organic networks is an underexplored method when preparing functional framework materials. Now, taking cue from DNA, bio-inspired G-quadruplexes are used as both intrinsic electron donors and hydrogen-bonding linkers to assemble rylene diimide acceptors. The resulting rectangular grids form layered crystalline frameworks, in which photoexcitation produces long-lived mobile charge carriers.

Regioselective reactions of 3,4-pyridynes enabled by the aryne distortion model

The pyridine heterocycle continues to play a vital role in the development of human medicines. More than 100 currently marketed drugs contain this privileged unit, which remains highly sought after synthetically. We report an efficient means to access di- and trisubstituted pyridines in an efficient and highly controlled manner using transient 3,4-pyridyne intermediates. Previous efforts to employ 3,4-pyridynes for the construction of substituted pyridines were hampered by a lack of regiocontrol or the inability to later manipulate an adjacent directing group. The strategy relies on the use of proximal halide or sulfamate substituents to perturb pyridyne distortion, which in turn governs regioselectivities in nucleophilic addition and cycloaddition reactions. After trapping of the pyridynes generated in situ, the neighbouring directing groups may be removed or exploited using versatile metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. This methodology now renders 3,4-pyridynes as useful synthetic building blocks for the creation of highly decorated derivatives of the medicinally privileged pyridine heterocycle. The in situ trapping of pyridynes is an efficient method for the generation of a variety of substituted pyridines but, until now, the method has been hampered by a lack of regiocontrol. Here, proximal halide and sulfamate substituents are shown to perturb pyridyne distortion and thus govern regioselectivities in pyridyne reactions.

Ultra stable self-assembled monolayers of N-heterocyclic carbenes on gold

Since the first report of thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) 30 years ago, these structures have been examined in a huge variety of applications. The oxidative and thermal instabilities of these systems are widely known, however, and are an impediment to their widespread commercial use. Here, we describe the generation of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-based SAMs on gold that demonstrate considerably greater resistance to heat and chemical reagents than the thiol-based counterparts. This increased stability is related to the increased strength of the gold–carbon bond relative to that of a gold–sulfur bond, and to a different mode of bonding in the case of the carbene ligand. Once bound to gold, NHCs are not displaced by thiols or thioethers, and are stable to high temperatures, boiling water, organic solvents, pH extremes, electrochemical cycling above 0&nbsp;V and 1% hydrogen peroxide. In particular, benzimidazole-derived carbenes provide films with the highest stabilities and evidence of short-range molecular ordering. Chemical derivatization can be employed to adjust the surface properties of NHC-based SAMs. Thiol-based self-assembled monolayers have a huge variety of potential applications but are hampered by oxidative and thermal instability. Now, N-heterocyclic carbenes are shown to form densely packed layers on Au(111) that are considerably more stable than thiol films, resisting hot organic solvents, acid, base, oxidant and oxidative electrohemical etching.

Engineering genetic circuit interactions within and between synthetic minimal cells

Genetic circuits and reaction cascades are of great importance for synthetic biology, biochemistry and bioengineering. An open question is how to maximize the modularity of their design to enable the integration of different reaction networks and to optimize their scalability and flexibility. One option is encapsulation within liposomes, which enables chemical reactions to proceed in well-isolated environments. Here we adapt liposome encapsulation to enable the modular, controlled compartmentalization of genetic circuits and cascades. We demonstrate that it is possible to engineer genetic circuit-containing synthetic minimal cells (synells) to contain multiple-part genetic cascades, and that these cascades can be controlled by external signals as well as inter-liposomal communication without crosstalk. We also show that liposomes that contain different cascades can be fused in a controlled way so that the products of incompatible reactions can be brought together. Synells thus enable a more modular creation of synthetic biology cascades, an essential step towards their ultimate programmability. Genetic circuits are important for synthetic biology, biochemistry and bioengineering. Now, the encapsulation of genetic circuits into liposomes has been shown to enable a more modular design, the selective isolation of reactions from the environment and from each other, and the hierarchical assembly of reaction products.

A heparin-mimicking polymer conjugate stabilizes basic fibroblast growth factor

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a protein that plays a crucial role in diverse cellular functions, from wound healing to bone regeneration. However, a major obstacle to the widespread application of bFGF is its inherent instability during storage and delivery. Here, we describe the stabilization of bFGF by covalent conjugation with a heparin-mimicking polymer, a copolymer consisting of styrene sulfonate units and methyl methacrylate units bearing poly(ethylene glycol) side chains. The bFGF conjugate of this polymer retained bioactivity after synthesis and was stable to a variety of environmentally and therapeutically relevant stressors—such as heat, mild and harsh acidic conditions, storage and proteolytic degradation—unlike native bFGF. Following the application of stress, the conjugate was also significantly more active than the control conjugate system in which the styrene sulfonate units were omitted from the polymer structure. This research has important implications for the clinical use of bFGF and for the stabilization of heparin-binding growth factors in general. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is crucial for a range of diverse cellular processes, from wound healing to bone regeneration, yet is inherently unstable. This important biologic has now been covalently linked to a polymer that mimics the polysaccharide heparin to produce a conjugate that shows remarkable stability to a wide range of therapeutically and environmentally relevant stressors.

Title: 
Biomolecular robotics for chemomechanically driven guest delivery fuelled by intracellular ATP

The development of nanocarriers that selectively release guest molecules on sensing a particular biological signal is being actively pursued in nanomedicine for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Here we report a protein-based nanocarrier that opens in the presence of intracellular adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP). The nanocarrier consists of multiple barrel-shaped chaperonin units assembled through coordination with Mg2+ into a tubular structure that protects guest molecules against biological degradation. When its surface is functionalized with a boronic acid derivative, the nanocarrier is able to enter cells. The hydrolysis of intracellular ATP into adenosine-5′-diphosphate (ADP) induces conformational changes of the chaperonin units, which in turns generate a mechanical force that leads to the disassembly of the tube and release of the guests. This scission occurs with a sigmoidal dependence on ATP concentration, which means that the nanocarrier can differentiate biological environments in terms of the concentration of ATP for selective guest release. Furthermore, biodistribution tests reveal preferential accumulation of the nanocarriers in a tumour tissue. A tubular assembly based on barrel-shaped chaperonin protein mutants, held together through coordination to magnesium ions, has been devised that carries and delivers guests into cells. The hydrolysis of ATP — present in much higher concentration inside the cell than outside — induces a conformational change in chaperonin that in turn triggers the guest release.

Title: 
The cytotoxicity of (−)-lomaiviticin A arises from induction of double-strand breaks in DNA

The metabolite (−)-lomaiviticin A, which contains two diazotetrahydrobenzo[b]fluorene (diazofluorene) functional groups, inhibits the growth of cultured human cancer cells at nanomolar–picomolar concentrations; however, the mechanism responsible for the potent cytotoxicity of this natural product is not known. Here we report that (−)-lomaiviticin A nicks and cleaves plasmid DNA by a pathway that is independent of reactive oxygen species and iron, and that the potent cytotoxicity of (−)-lomaiviticin A arises from the induction of DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs). In a plasmid cleavage assay, the ratio of single-strand breaks (ssbs) to dsbs is 5.3&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.6:1. Labelling studies suggest that this cleavage occurs via a radical pathway. The structurally related isolates (−)-lomaiviticin C and (−)-kinamycin C, which contain one diazofluorene, are demonstrated to be much less effective DNA cleavage agents, thereby providing an explanation for the enhanced cytotoxicity of (−)-lomaiviticin A compared to that of other members of this family. (−)-Lomaiviticin&nbsp;A inhibits the growth of cancer cells at nanomolar to picomolar concentrations; however, the basis for this potent cytotoxicity is not known. This natural product has now been shown to induce production of DNA double-strand breaks at nanomolar concentrations. Evidence demonstrates that strand cleavage proceeds via reactive carbon-centred free radical intermediates.

Title: 
Covalent functionalization of monolayered transition metal dichalcogenides by phase engineering

Chemical functionalization of low-dimensional materials such as nanotubes, nanowires and graphene leads to profound changes in their properties and is essential for solubilizing them in common solvents. Covalent attachment of functional groups is generally achieved at defect sites, which facilitate electron transfer. Here, we describe a simple and general method for covalent functionalization of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets (MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2), which does not rely on defect engineering. The functionalization reaction is instead facilitated by electron transfer between the electron-rich metallic 1T phase and an organohalide reactant, resulting in functional groups that are covalently attached to the chalcogen atoms of the transition metal dichalcogenide. The attachment of functional groups leads to dramatic changes in the optoelectronic properties of the material. For example, we show that it renders the metallic 1T phase semiconducting, and gives it strong and tunable photoluminescence and gate modulation in field-effect transistors. Modifying or functionalizing transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) allows their properties to be altered and controlled. Now, non-defect-mediated covalent functionalization of single-layer semiconducting TMDs such as MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2 has been demonstrated by reacting them with organohalides, utilizing the excess charge in the 1T metallic phase.

Title: 
Control of selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis by tuning nanoparticle properties and reactor residence time

A combination of the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis could enable the development of sustainable catalysts with novel reactivity and selectivity. Although heterogeneous catalysts are often recycled more easily than their homogeneous counterparts, they can be difficult to apply in traditional organic reactions and modification of their properties towards a desired reactivity is, at best, complex. In contrast, tuning the properties of homogeneous catalysts by, for example, modifying the ligands that coordinate a metal centre is better understood. Here, using olefin cyclopropanation reactions catalysed by dendrimer-encapsulated Au nanoclusters as examples, we demonstrate that changing the dendrimer properties allows the catalytic reactivity to be tuned in a similar fashion to ligand modification in a homogeneous catalyst. Furthermore, we show that these heterogeneous catalysts employed in a fixed-bed flow reactor allow fine control over the residence time of the reactants and thus enables the control over product distribution in a way that is not easily available for homogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts are generally more readily recycled than homogeneous catalysts, but the latter are more easily modified to tune reactivity and selectivity. Here, the dendrimer coating of gold nanoparticle catalysts is shown to be a surrogate for the ligands of homogeneous catalysts. Tuning of product distribution and reaction selectivity is possible when these catalysts are employed in a fixed-bed flow reactor.

Title: 
A simple and accessible synthetic lectin for glucose recognition and sensing

Binding carbohydrates from water is a difficult task, even for the natural carbohydrate-binding proteins known as lectins. The design of synthetic lectin mimics is correspondingly challenging, especially if good selectivities are required. In previous work we showed that success is possible, but only for complex polycyclic architectures that require lengthy and low-yielding syntheses; for example, one glucose-selective system was made in 21 steps and only 0.1% overall yield. Here we report the discovery of a simple monocyclic host that matches the earlier designs, but is far more accessible as it is prepared in just five steps and 23% overall yield. The new synthetic lectin binds glucose with excellent selectivity versus other common monosaccharides (for example, ∼50:1 versus galactose) and sufficient affinity for glucose sensing at the concentrations found in blood. It also features a built-in signalling system in the form of strong and guest-dependent fluorescence emission. The effectiveness and simplicity of this molecule suggests the potential for development into a new methodology for practical glucose monitoring. Selective carbohydrate binding is a difficult task, usually accomplished by proteins (lectins) or complex synthetic analogues. It has now been achieved by a remarkably simple compound, accessible in just five steps from commercially available materials. This new receptor is highly selective for all-equatorial carbohydrates, and may be used to sense glucose through changes in anthracene fluorescence.

Title: 
Capturing snapshots of post-synthetic metallation chemistry in metal–organic frameworks

Post-synthetic metallation is employed strategically to imbue metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with enhanced performance characteristics. However, obtaining precise structural information for metal-centred reactions that take place within the pores of these materials has remained an elusive goal, because of issues with high symmetry in certain MOFs, lower initial crystallinity for some chemically robust MOFs, and the reduction in crystallinity that can result from carrying out post-synthetic reactions on parent crystals. Here, we report a new three-dimensional MOF possessing pore cavities that are lined with vacant di-pyrazole groups poised for post-synthetic metallation. These metallations occur quantitatively without appreciable loss of crystallinity, thereby enabling examination of the products by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. To illustrate the potential of this platform to garner fundamental insight into metal-catalysed reactions in porous solids we use single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies to structurally elucidate the reaction products of consecutive oxidative addition and methyl migration steps that occur within the pores of the Rh-metallated MOF, 1·[Rh(CO)2][Rh(CO)2Cl2]. Obtaining precise structural information for metal-centred reactions that take place within the pores of metal–organic frameworks continues to be an elusive goal. Now, a flexible framework has been synthesized that enables the direct elucidation of the products of post-synthetic metallation reactions and subsequent chemical transformations by single-crystal X-ray crystallography.

Title: 
Conditionally fluorescent molecular probes for detecting single base changes in double-stranded DNA

Small variations in nucleic acid sequences can have far-reaching phenotypic consequences. Reliably distinguishing closely related sequences is therefore important for research and clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate that conditionally fluorescent DNA probes are capable of distinguishing variations of a single base in a stretch of target DNA. These probes use a novel programmable mechanism in which each single nucleotide polymorphism generates two thermodynamically destabilizing mismatch bubbles rather than the single mismatch formed during typical hybridization-based assays. Up to a 12,000-fold excess of a target that contains a single nucleotide polymorphism is required to generate the same fluorescence as one equivalent of the intended target, and detection works reliably over a wide range of conditions. Using these probes we detected point mutations in a 198 base-pair subsequence of the Escherichia coli rpoB gene. That our probes are constructed from multiple oligonucleotides circumvents synthesis limitations and enables long continuous DNA sequences to be probed. A molecular probe has been designed that distinguishes double-stranded DNA with single base-pair specificity. In this approach, two destabilizing bubbles, in which the base pairs are mismatched, are generated for each point mutation in the target DNA.

Ultrahigh-throughput exfoliation of graphite into pristine ‘single-layer’ graphene using microwaves and molecularly engineered ionic liquids

Graphene has shown much promise as an organic electronic material but, despite recent achievements in the production of few-layer graphene, the quantitative exfoliation of graphite into pristine single-layer graphene has remained one of the main challenges in developing practical devices. Recently, reduced graphene oxide has been recognized as a non-feasible alternative to graphene owing to variable defect types and levels, and attention is turning towards reliable methods for the high-throughput exfoliation of graphite. Here we report that microwave irradiation of graphite suspended in molecularly engineered oligomeric ionic liquids allows for ultrahigh-efficiency exfoliation (93% yield) with a high selectivity (95%) towards ‘single-layer’ graphene (that is, with thicknesses &lt;1 nm) in a short processing time (30 minutes). The isolated graphene sheets show negligible structural deterioration. They are also readily redispersible in oligomeric ionic liquids up to ~100 mg ml–1, and form physical gels in which an anisotropic orientation of graphene sheets, once induced by a magnetic field, is maintained. Graphene possesses numerous interesting properties yet the preparation of pristine sheets has remained challenging, hindering practical applications. Now, a rapid, highly efficient step has been devised that uses microwave irradiation in oligomeric ionic liquids to exfoliate graphite into pristine ‘single layer’ sheets (&lt;1 nm thick). A concentrated dispersion of the resulting material behaves as a physical gel.

Predicting DNA hybridization kinetics from sequence

Hybridization is a key molecular process in biology and biotechnology, but so far there is no predictive model for accurately determining hybridization rate constants based on sequence information. Here, we report a weighted neighbour voting (WNV) prediction algorithm, in which the hybridization rate constant of an unknown sequence is predicted based on similarity reactions with known rate constants. To construct this algorithm we first performed 210 fluorescence kinetics experiments to observe the hybridization kinetics of 100 different DNA target and probe pairs (36 nt sub-sequences of the CYCS and VEGF genes) at temperatures ranging from 28 to 55 °C. Automated feature selection and weighting optimization resulted in a final six-feature WNV model, which can predict hybridization rate constants of new sequences to within a factor of 3 with ∼91% accuracy, based on leave-one-out cross-validation. Accurate prediction of hybridization kinetics allows the design of efficient probe sequences for genomics research. The rate constant of DNA hybridization varies over several orders of magnitude and is affected by temperature and DNA sequence. A machine-learning algorithm that is capable of accurately predicting hybridization rate constants has now been developed. Tests with this algorithm showed that over 90% of predictions were correct to within a factor of three.

Title: 
The structural and chemical origin of the oxygen redox activity in layered and cation-disordered Li-excess cathode materials

Lithium-ion batteries are now reaching the energy density limits set by their electrode materials, requiring new paradigms for Li+ and electron hosting in solid-state electrodes. Reversible oxygen redox in the solid state in particular has the potential to enable high energy density as it can deliver excess capacity beyond the theoretical transition-metal redox-capacity at a high voltage. Nevertheless, the structural and chemical origin of the process is not understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, we demonstrate how very specific local Li-excess environments around oxygen atoms necessarily lead to labile oxygen electrons that can be more easily extracted and participate in the practical capacity of cathodes. The identification of the local structural components that create oxygen redox sets a new direction for the design of high-energy-density cathode materials. The chemistry of the transition metals within the oxide cathodes of lithium-ion batteries typically limits their capacity, however, reversible oxygen redox could potentially break this limit. It is now demonstrated that Li-excess and cation disorder create specific environments around oxygen atoms that lead to labile oxygen electrons that participate in the practical capacity of cathodes.

Title: 
Directionally tunable and mechanically deformable ferroelectric crystals from rotating polar globular ionic molecules

Ferroelectrics are used in a wide range of applications, including memory elements, capacitors and sensors. Recently, molecular ferroelectric crystals have attracted interest as viable alternatives to conventional ceramic ferroelectrics because of their solution processability and lack of toxicity. Here we show that a class of molecular compounds—known as plastic crystals—can exhibit ferroelectricity if the constituents are judiciously chosen from polar ionic molecules. The intrinsic features of plastic crystals, for example, the rotational motion of molecules and phase transitions with lattice-symmetry changes, provide the crystals with unique ferroelectric properties relative to those of conventional molecular crystals. This allows a flexible alteration of the polarization axis direction in a grown crystal by applying an electric field. Owing to the tunable nature of the crystal orientation, together with mechanical deformability, this type of molecular crystal represents an attractive functional material that could find use in a diverse range of applications. A major drawback of molecular ferroelectric crystals, low dimensionality, has now been overcome by ionic plastic crystals. Molecular rotation and phase transitions intrinsic to the crystals make the materials unique molecular ferroelectrics, where the polarization axis direction in a grown crystal can be flexibly altered by applying an electric field.

Breaking scaling relations to achieve low-temperature ammonia synthesis through LiH-mediated nitrogen transfer and hydrogenation

Ammonia synthesis under mild conditions is a goal that has been long sought after. Previous investigations have shown that adsorption and transition-state energies of intermediates in this process on transition metals (TMs) scale with each other. This prevents the independent optimization of these energies that would result in the ideal catalyst: one that activates reactants well, but binds intermediates relatively weakly. Here we demonstrate that these scaling relations can be broken by intervening in the TM-mediated catalysis with a second catalytic site, LiH. The negatively charged hydrogen atoms of LiH act as strong reducing agents, which remove activated nitrogen atoms from the TM or its nitride (TMN), and as an immediate source of hydrogen, which binds nitrogen atoms to form LiNH2. LiNH2 further splits H2 heterolytically to give off NH3 and regenerate LiH. This synergy between TM (or TMN) and LiH creates a favourable pathway that allows both early and late 3d TM–LiH composites to exhibit unprecedented lower-temperature catalytic activities. The existence of linear scaling relations between the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates on transition-metal surfaces prevents their independent optimization and limits catalytic activity. It has now been shown that using a catalytic LiH site alongside a transition-metal catalyst can break these intrinsic scaling relations, leading to unprecedented lower-temperature ammonia-synthesis activity.

Title: 
Self-assembled nanospheres with multiple endohedral binding sites pre-organize catalysts and substrates for highly efficient reactions

Tuning reagent and catalyst concentrations is crucial in the development of efficient catalytic transformations. In enzyme-catalysed reactions the substrate is bound—often by multiple non-covalent interactions—in a well-defined pocket close to the active site of the enzyme; this pre-organization facilitates highly efficient transformations. Here we report an artificial system that co-encapsulates multiple catalysts and substrates within the confined space defined by an M12L24 nanosphere that contains 24 endohedral guanidinium-binding sites. Cooperative binding means that sulfonate guests are bound much more strongly than carboxylates. This difference has been used to fix gold-based catalysts firmly, with the remaining binding sites left to pre-organize substrates. This strategy was applied to a Au(I)-catalysed cyclization of acetylenic acid to enol lactone in which the pre-organization resulted in much higher reaction rates. We also found that the encapsulated sulfonate-containing Au(I) catalysts did not convert neutral (acid) substrates, and so could have potential in the development of substrate-selective catalysis and base-triggered on/off switching of catalysis. Preorganization of catalysts and substrates can lead to significant rate enhancement—an effect often observed in enzyme catalysis. Now, a self-assembled nanosphere equipped with 24 guanidinium binding sites is demonstrated to strongly bind sulfonate-containing gold catalysts. Base-triggered co-encapsulation of carboxylate containing substrates leads to pronounced gating effects and dramatically enhanced reaction rates.

Triamidoamine uranium(IV)–arsenic complexes containing one-, two- and threefold U–As bonding interactions

To further our fundamental understanding of the nature and extent of covalency in uranium–ligand bonding, and the benefits that this may have for the design of new ligands for nuclear waste separation, there is burgeoning interest in the nature of uranium complexes with soft- and multiple-bond-donor ligands. Despite this, there have so far been no examples of structurally authenticated molecular uranium–arsenic bonds under ambient conditions. Here, we report molecular uranium(IV)–arsenic complexes featuring formal single, double and triple U–As bonding interactions. Compound formulations are supported by a range of characterization techniques, and theoretical calculations suggest the presence of polarized covalent one-, two- and threefold bonding interactions between uranium and arsenic in parent arsenide [U–AsH2], terminal arsinidene [U=AsH] and arsenido [U≡AsK2] complexes, respectively. These studies inform our understanding of the bonding of actinides with soft donor ligands and may be of use in future ligand design in this area. The nature of actinide–ligand bonding is attracting attention, in particular in the context of nuclear waste separations. Structurally authenticated one-, two- and threefold uranium–arsenic bonding interactions are now reported. Computational analysis suggests the presence of polarized σ2, σ2π2, and σ2π4 in the arsenide, terminal arsinidene, and arsenido complexes, respectively.

A manganese catalyst for highly reactive yet chemoselective intramolecular C(sp3)–H amination

C–H bond oxidation reactions underscore the existing paradigm wherein high reactivity and high selectivity are inversely correlated. The development of catalysts capable of oxidizing strong aliphatic C(sp3)–H bonds while displaying chemoselectivity (that is, tolerance of more oxidizable functionality) remains an unsolved problem. Here, we describe a catalyst, manganese tert-butylphthalocyanine [Mn(tBuPc)], that is an outlier to the reactivity–selectivity paradigm. It is unique in its capacity to functionalize all types of C(sp3)–H bond intramolecularly, while displaying excellent chemoselectivity in the presence of π functionality. Mechanistic studies indicate that [Mn(tBuPc)] transfers bound nitrenes to C(sp3)–H bonds via a pathway that lies between concerted C–H insertion, observed with reactive noble metals such as rhodium, and stepwise radical C–H abstraction/rebound, as observed with chemoselective base metals such as iron. Rather than achieving a blending of effects, [Mn(tBuPc)] aminates even 1° aliphatic and propargylic C–H bonds, demonstrating reactivity and selectivity unusual for previously known catalysts. A manganese catalyst is reported that aminates C–H bonds via a mechanism that lies between that of reactive noble metals (concerted) and chemoselective base metals (stepwise). Rather than exhibiting intermediate reactivity and selectivity, [Mn(tBuPc)] is an outlier, and aminates all C(sp3)–H bonds, including 1°, while remaining tolerant of oxidizable π-functionality.

Controlling epithelial sodium channels with light using photoswitchable amilorides

Amiloride is a widely used diuretic that blocks epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). These heterotrimeric transmembrane proteins, assembled from β, γ and α or δ subunits, effectively control water transport across epithelia and sodium influx into non-epithelial cells. The functional role of δβγENaC in various organs, including the human brain, is still poorly understood and no pharmacological tools are available for the functional differentiation between α- and δ-containing ENaCs. Here we report several photoswitchable versions of amiloride. One compound, termed PA1, enables the optical control of ENaC channels, in particular the δβγ isoform, by switching between blue and green light, or by turning on and off blue light. PA1 was used to modify functionally δβγENaC in amphibian and mammalian cells. We also show that PA1 can be used to differentiate between δβγENaC and αβγENaC in a model for the human lung epithelium. Amiloride is a widely used diuretic that blocks epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs); however, the functional role of the different ENaC isoforms is still poorly understood and no pharmacological tools exist to differentiate between them. Now, photoswitchable amilorides that enable the optical control of ENaCs, and can distinguish between different ENaC isoforms have been developed.

Redox-induced reversible metal assembly through translocation and reversible ligand coupling in tetranuclear metal sandwich frameworks

Sandwich structures formed by metal atoms intercalated between sp2-carbon planes can be found either in metal–graphite-based materials or discrete multinuclear sandwich complexes. Their reactivity, and in particular their dynamic behaviour, has recently attracted interest both from a structural and a practical aspect, for example in catalysis. However, progress in this area has been rather slow, and it remains difficult to elucidate their structure and behaviour at the molecular level. Here, we report two sandwich complexes—in which four palladium centres are incorporated between two π-conjugated ligands—which exhibit two modes of redox-switchable structural changes. In the first complex, the tetrapalladium chain is split by oxidation into two well-separated dipalladium units. This motion is reversed on reduction. In the second complex, reversible carbon–carbon coupling occurs between the ligands during the redox process. Despite their potential roles in catalysis and materials science, the redox-induced dynamic structural changes in (sp2-carbon ligand)–(multiple metals)–(sp2-carbon ligand) systems are not well understood. Now, tetra-palladium sandwich complexes have been described that exhibit redox-switchable assembly of the metal centres or coupling of the ligands.

Site-selective oxidation, amination and epimerization reactions of complex polyols enabled by transfer hydrogenation

Polyoxygenated hydrocarbons that bear one or more hydroxyl groups comprise a large set of natural and synthetic compounds, often with potent biological activity. In synthetic chemistry, alcohols are important precursors to carbonyl groups, which then can be converted into a wide range of oxygen- or nitrogen-based functionality. Therefore, the selective conversion of a single hydroxyl group in natural products into a ketone would enable the selective introduction of unnatural functionality. However, the methods known to convert a simple alcohol, or even an alcohol in a molecule that contains multiple protected functional groups, are not suitable for selective reactions of complex polyol structures. We present a new ruthenium catalyst with a unique efficacy for the selective oxidation of a single hydroxyl group among many in unprotected polyol natural products. This oxidation enables the introduction of nitrogen-based functional groups into such structures that lack nitrogen atoms and enables a selective alcohol epimerization by stepwise or reversible oxidation and reduction. Polyoxygenated aliphatic chains with multiple hydroxyl groups are common in a wide array of compounds, often with potent biological activity. Now, a new ruthenium catalyst enables selective dehydrogenation of a single hydroxyl group in a broad scope of complex polyols. This site-selective modification facilitates the rapid incorporation of nitrogen-based functional groups into diverse natural products.

Induced-fit catalysis of corannulene bowl-to-bowl inversion

Stereoelectronic complementarity between the active site of an enzyme and the transition state of a reaction is one of the tenets of enzyme catalysis. This report illustrates the principles of enzyme catalysis (first proposed by Pauling and Jencks) through a well-defined model system that has been fully characterized crystallographically, computationally and kinetically. Catalysis of the bowl-to-bowl inversion processes that pertain to corannulene is achieved by combining ground-state destabilization and transition-state stabilization within the cavity of an extended tetracationic cyclophane. This synthetic receptor fulfils a role reminiscent of a catalytic antibody by stabilizing the planar transition state for the bowl-to-bowl inversion of (ethyl)corannulene (which accelerates this process by a factor of ten at room temperature) by an induced-fit mechanism first formulated by Koshland. Enzymatic catalysis relies on stereoelectronic complementarity between the enzyme's active site and the substrate's transition state. A simple model system illustrating this tenet has now been devised. The bowl-to-bowl inversion of corannulene, catalysed inside the cavity of a synthetic receptor by an induced-fit mechanism, arises from ground-state destabilization combined with transition-state stabilization.

Dissipative self-assembly of vesicular nanoreactors

Dissipative self-assembly is exploited by nature to control important biological functions, such as cell division, motility and signal transduction. The ability to construct synthetic supramolecular assemblies that require the continuous consumption of energy to remain in the functional state is an essential premise for the design of synthetic systems with lifelike properties. Here, we show a new strategy for the dissipative self-assembly of functional supramolecular structures with high structural complexity. It relies on the transient stabilization of vesicles through noncovalent interactions between the surfactants and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which acts as the chemical fuel. It is shown that the lifetime of the vesicles can be regulated by controlling the hydrolysis rate of ATP. The vesicles sustain a chemical reaction but only as long as chemical fuel is present to keep the system in the out-of-equilibrium state. The lifetime of the vesicles determines the amount of reaction product produced by the system. Dissipative self-assembly processes are energetically uphill and require the continuous consumption of energy. Now, by using ATP as a chemical fuel, the dissipative self-assembly of vesicles has been demonstrated. These transiently formed supramolecular assemblies are able to sustain a chemical reaction and it is shown that the yield depends on the lifetime of the vesicles.

Prebiotically plausible oligoribonucleotide ligation facilitated by chemoselective acetylation

The recent synthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleoside-2′,3′-cyclic phosphates under prebiotically plausible conditions has strengthened the case for the involvement of ribonucleic acid (RNA) at an early stage in the origin of life. However, a prebiotic conversion of these weakly activated monomers, and their purine counterparts, to the 3′,5′-linked RNA polymers of extant biochemistry has been lacking (previous attempts led only to short oligomers with mixed linkages). Here we show that the 2′-hydroxyl group of oligoribonucleotide-3′-phosphates can be chemoselectively acetylated in water under prebiotically credible conditions, which allows rapid and efficient template-directed ligation. The 2′-O-acetyl group at the ligation junction of the product RNA strand can be removed under conditions that leave the internucleotide bonds intact. Remarkably, acetylation of mixed oligomers that possess either 2′- or 3′-terminal phosphates is selective for the 2′-hydroxyl group of the latter. This newly discovered chemistry thus suggests a prebiotic route from ribonucleoside-2′,3′-cyclic phosphates to predominantly 3′,5′-linked RNA via partially 2′-O-acetylated RNA. One theory for the abiogenesis of RNA involves ligation of shorter oligomers that are observed after dry-state condensation of mononucleotides. Here, the chemo- and regioselective acetylation of (oligo)nucleotides in water under prebiotically plausible conditions is described. This remarkable selectivity permits the rapid template-directed ligation of oligomers to favour extant 3′,5′-linkages.

Oligomerization transforms human APOBEC3G from an efficient enzyme to a slowly dissociating nucleic acid-binding protein

The human APOBEC3 proteins are a family of DNA-editing enzymes that play an important role in the innate immune response against retroviruses and retrotransposons. APOBEC3G is a member of this family that inhibits HIV-1 replication in the absence of the viral infectivity factor Vif. Inhibition of HIV replication occurs by both deamination of viral single-stranded DNA and a deamination-independent mechanism. Efficient deamination requires rapid binding to and dissociation from ssDNA. However, a relatively slow dissociation rate is required for the proposed deaminase-independent roadblock mechanism in which APOBEC3G binds the viral template strand and blocks reverse transcriptase-catalysed DNA elongation. Here, we show that APOBEC3G initially binds ssDNA with rapid on–off rates and subsequently converts to a slowly dissociating mode. In contrast, an oligomerization-deficient APOBEC3G mutant did not exhibit a slow off rate. We propose that catalytically active monomers or dimers slowly oligomerize on the viral genome and inhibit reverse transcription. HIV-1 replication is inhibited by the enzyme APOBEC3G via two separate mechanisms. A deamination mechanism requires rapid binding and release of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), whereas a roadblock mechanism requires slow binding. Now APOBEC3G has been shown to initially bind ssDNA with rapid on–off rates. The enzyme subsequently converts via oligomerization to a slowly dissociating binding mode, which, it is proposed, inhibits reverse transcription.

Title: 
A stable germanone as the first isolated heavy ketone with a terminal oxygen atom

The carbon–oxygen double bond of ketones (R2C=O) makes them among the most important organic compounds, but their homologues, heavy ketones with an E=O double bond (E&nbsp;=&nbsp;Si, Ge, Sn or Pb), had not been isolated as stable compounds. Their unavailability as monomeric molecules is ascribed to their high tendency for intermolecular oligomerization or polymerization via opening of the E=O double bond. Can such an intermolecular process be inhibited by bulky protecting groups? We now report that it can, with the first isolation of a monomeric germanium ketone analogue (Eind)2Ge=O (Eind&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octaethyl-s-hydrindacen-4-yl), stabilized by appropriately designed bulky Eind groups, with a planar tricoordinate germanium atom. Computational studies and chemical reactions suggest the Ge=O double bond is highly polarized with a contribution of a charge-separated form (Eind)2Ge+−O−. The germanone thus exhibits unique reactivities that are not observed with ordinary ketones, including the spontaneous trapping of CO2 gas to provide a cyclic addition product. Heavier analogues of ketones — containing a double bond between a group 14 element and oxygen — have so far not been isolated as stable compounds. Now, a stable monomeric germanone with a highly polarized Ge=O double bond has been isolated, stabilized by rigid bulky ligands.

The synthesis, crystal structure and charge-transport properties of hexacene

Acenes can be thought of as one-dimensional strips of graphene and they have the potential to be used in the next generation of electronic devices. However, because acenes larger than pentacene have been found to be unstable, it was generally accepted that they would not be particularly useful materials under normal conditions. Here, we show that, by using a physical vapour-transport method, platelet-shaped crystals of hexacene can be prepared from a monoketone precursor. These crystals are stable in the dark for a long period of time under ambient conditions. In the crystal, the molecules are arranged in herringbone arrays, quite similar to that observed for pentacene. A field-effect transistor made using a single crystal of hexacene displayed a hole mobility significantly higher than that of pentacene. This result suggests that it might be instructive to further explore the potential of other higher acenes. Crystals of hexacene prepared from a monoketone precursor are found to be stable up to 300&nbsp;°C in the dark, but readily decompose when exposed to light. An organic-field transistor made with a single crystal of hexacene was found to have superior properties to one made from pentacene under analogous conditions.

Assembling molecular Sierpiński triangle fractals

Fractals, being “exactly the same at every scale or nearly the same at different scales” as defined by Benoit B. Mandelbrot, are complicated yet fascinating patterns that are important in aesthetics, mathematics, science and engineering. Extended molecular fractals formed by the self-assembly of small-molecule components have long been pursued but, to the best of our knowledge, not achieved. To tackle this challenge we designed and made two aromatic bromo compounds (4,4″-dibromo-1,1′:3′,1″-terphenyl and 4,4‴-dibromo-1,1′:3′,1″:4″,1‴-quaterphenyl) to serve as building blocks. The formation of synergistic halogen and hydrogen bonds between these molecules is the driving force to assemble successfully a whole series of defect-free molecular fractals, specifically Sierpiński triangles, on a Ag(111) surface below 80 K. Several critical points that govern the preparation of the molecular Sierpiński triangles were scrutinized experimentally and revealed explicitly. This new strategy may be applied to prepare and explore various planar molecular fractals at surfaces. A series of molecular fractals, specifically Sierpiński triangles, can be assembled on a Ag(111) surface from small, bent oligophenyls with a bromo group at each end. The self-assembly is driven by the formation of synergistic halogen and hydrogen bonds between the molecular building blocks, and defect-free structures with more than 100 individual components are observed.

Title: 
Synthetic cascades are enabled by combining biocatalysts with artificial metalloenzymes

Enzymatic catalysis and homogeneous catalysis offer complementary means to address synthetic challenges, both in chemistry and in biology. Despite its attractiveness, the implementation of concurrent cascade reactions that combine an organometallic catalyst with an enzyme has proven challenging because of the mutual inactivation of both catalysts. To address this, we show that incorporation of a d6-piano stool complex within a host protein affords an artificial transfer hydrogenase (ATHase) that is fully compatible with and complementary to natural enzymes, thus enabling efficient concurrent tandem catalysis. To illustrate the generality of the approach, the ATHase was combined with various NADH-, FAD- and haem-dependent enzymes, resulting in orthogonal redox cascades. Up to three enzymes were integrated in the cascade and combined with the ATHase with a view to achieving (i) a double stereoselective amine deracemization, (ii) a horseradish peroxidase-coupled readout of the transfer hydrogenase activity towards its genetic optimization, (iii) the formation of L-pipecolic acid from L-lysine and (iv) regeneration of NADH to promote a monooxygenase-catalysed oxyfunctionalization reaction. An artificial transfer hydrogenase, based on the incorporation of a biotinylated iridium-piano-stool complex in streptavidin, is shown to be fully compatible with a range of biocatalysts. The location of the active metal centre inside the protein scaffold efficiently prevents mutual inactivation processes and enables the concurrent interplay with oxidative enzymes.

Title: 
A two-dimensional polymer prepared by organic synthesis

Synthetic polymers are widely used materials, as attested by a production of more than 200 millions of tons per year, and are typically composed of linear repeat units. They may also be branched or irregularly crosslinked. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional polymer with internal periodicity composed of areal repeat units. This is an extension of Staudinger's polymerization concept (to form macromolecules by covalently linking repeat units together), but in two dimensions. A well-known example of such a two-dimensional polymer is graphene, but its thermolytic synthesis precludes molecular design on demand. Here, we have rationally synthesized an ordered, non-equilibrium two-dimensional polymer far beyond molecular dimensions. The procedure includes the crystallization of a specifically designed photoreactive monomer into a layered structure, a photo-polymerization step within the crystal and a solvent-induced delamination step that isolates individual two-dimensional polymers as free-standing, monolayered molecular sheets. A two-dimensional polymer with internal periodicity has now been constructed. The procedure involves the rational molecular design of monomers, which first crystallize into a laminar lattice. A photo-induced polymerization then occurs laterally within each layer, and the resulting polymer crystals are subsequently delaminated into individual, free-standing two-dimensional polymers.

Title: 
A viscous solvent enables information transfer from gene-length nucleic acids in a model prebiotic replication cycle

Many hypotheses concerning the nature of early life assume that genetic information was once transferred through the template-directed synthesis of RNA, before the emergence of coded enzymes. However, attempts to demonstrate enzyme-free, template-directed synthesis of nucleic acids have been limited by ‘strand inhibition’, whereby transferring information from a template strand in the presence of its complementary strand is inhibited by the stability of the template duplex. Here, we use solvent viscosity to circumvent strand inhibition, demonstrating information transfer from a gene-length template (&gt;300 nt) within a longer (545 bp or 3 kb) duplex. These results suggest that viscous environments on the prebiotic Earth, generated periodically by water evaporation, could have facilitated nucleic acid replication—particularly of long, structured sequences such as ribozymes. Our approach works with DNA and RNA, suggesting that viscosity-mediated replication is possible for a range of genetic polymers, perhaps even for informational polymers that may have preceded RNA. An unanswered question in the RNA world scenario is how sequence information could be transferred during replication of duplex RNA. Without the aid of sophisticated enzymes, strand reannealing occurs more quickly than template-directed synthesis. Now, a plausible prebiotic solution to this problem is presented, in which a viscous solvent enables information transfer from a gene-length double-stranded template.

Title: 
Local vibrational coherences drive the primary photochemistry of vision

The role of vibrational coherence—concerted vibrational motion on the excited-state potential energy surface—in the isomerization of retinal in the protein rhodopsin remains elusive, despite considerable experimental and theoretical efforts. We revisited this problem with resonant ultrafast heterodyne-detected transient-grating spectroscopy. The enhanced sensitivity that this technique provides allows us to probe directly the primary photochemical reaction of vision with sufficient temporal and spectral resolution to resolve all the relevant nuclear dynamics of the retinal chromophore during isomerization. We observed coherent photoproduct formation on a sub-50 fs timescale, and recovered a host of vibrational modes of the retinal chromophore that modulate the transient-grating signal during the isomerization reaction. Through Fourier filtering and subsequent time-domain analysis of the transient vibrational dynamics, the excited-state nuclear motions that drive the isomerization reaction were identified, and comprise stretching, torsional and out-of-plane wagging motions about the local C11=C12 isomerization coordinate. The isomerization of the retinal chromophore of rhodopsin is the photochemical process that initiates the sense of vision. Now, heterodyne-detected transient grating spectroscopy has been used to resolve coherent vibrational dynamics during this process, helping to identify strictly local vibrational motions as the origin of the coherent surface crossing, which occurs on a sub-50-fs timescale.

Title: 
A metallo-DNA nanowire with uninterrupted one-dimensional silver array

The double-helix structure of DNA, in which complementary strands reversibly hybridize to each other, not only explains how genetic information is stored and replicated, but also has proved very attractive for the development of nanomaterials. The discovery of metal-mediated base pairs has prompted the generation of short metal–DNA hybrid duplexes by a bottom-up approach. Here we describe a metallo-DNA nanowire—whose structure was solved by high-resolution X-ray crystallography—that consists of dodecamer duplexes held together by four different metal-mediated base pairs (the previously observed C–Ag–C, as well as G–Ag–G, G–Ag–C and T–Ag–T) and linked to each other through G overhangs involved in interduplex G–Ag–G. The resulting hybrid nanowires are 2 nm wide with a length of the order of micrometres to millimetres, and hold the silver ions in uninterrupted one-dimensional arrays along the DNA helical axis. The hybrid nanowires are further assembled into three-dimensional lattices by interactions between adenine residues, fully bulged out of the double helix. A metallo–DNA hybrid nanowire composed only of silver-mediated base pairs has been prepared and its crystal structure resolved by X-ray diffraction. The nanowire, which is 2 nm wide and whose length reaches the μm to mm scale, holds silver ions into uninterrupted one-dimensional arrays along the DNA helical axis.

Title: 
On the cooperative formation of non-hydrogen-bonded water at molecular hydrophobic interfaces

The unique structural, dynamical and chemical properties of air/water and oil/water interfaces are thought to play a key role in various biological, geological and environmental processes. For example, non-hydrogen-bonded (‘dangling’) OH groups—which create surface defects in water's hydrogen bonding network and are experimentally detected at both macroscopic (air/water or oil/water) and microscopic (dissolved hydrophobic molecule) interfaces—are thought to catalyse some chemical reactions. However, how the size, curvature or charge of the exposed hydrophobic surface influences water's propensity to form dangling OH defects has not yet been established quantitatively. Here we use Raman multivariate curve resolution to probe spectroscopically the hydrophobic hydration shell and, using a statistical multisite analysis, we show that such interfacial dangling OH structures are entropically stabilized and their formation is cooperative (the probability that a non-hydrogen-bonded OH group will form depends nonlinearly on the hydrophobic surface area). We thus expose an important difference between the chemical properties of molecular and macroscopic oil/water interfaces. Hydrophobe/water interfaces are crucial for many chemical processes, but to be fully understood, a better appreciation of the behaviour of non-hydrogen-bonded OH groups of water is required. It is now shown that such ‘dangling’ OH structures are entropically stabilized and form cooperatively, that is, the probability of their formation depends nonlinearly on hydrophobic surface area.

Title: 
Dual-display of small molecules enables the discovery of ligand pairs and facilitates affinity maturation

In contrast to standard fragment-based drug discovery approaches, dual-display DNA-encoded chemical libraries have the potential to identify fragment pairs that bind simultaneously and benefit from the chelate effect. However, the technology has been limited by the difficulty in unambiguously decoding the ligand pairs from large combinatorial libraries. Here we report a strategy that overcomes this limitation and enables the efficient identification of ligand pairs that bind to a target protein. Small organic molecules were conjugated to the 5′ and 3′ ends of complementary DNA strands that contain a unique identifying code. DNA hybridization followed by an inter-strand code-transfer created a stable dual-display DNA-encoded chemical library of 111,100 members. Using this approach we report the discovery of a low micromolar binder to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and the affinity maturation of a ligand to carbonic anhydrase IX, an established marker of renal cell carcinoma. The newly discovered subnanomolar carbonic anhydrase IX binder dramatically improved tumour targeting performance in vivo. A method to identify pairs of ligands that simultaneously bind to a target protein has been developed. The method uses two DNA-encoded chemical sub-libraries that self-assemble to form stable dual-display structures, and an encoding system that can be decoded by DNA sequencing and enables both ligands to be identified.

Title: 
Dynamic formation of a solid-liquid electrolyte interphase and its consequences for hybrid-battery concepts

The discharging and charging of batteries require ion transfer across phase boundaries. In conventional lithium-ion batteries, Li+ ions have to cross the liquid electrolyte and only need to pass the electrode interfaces. Future high-energy batteries may need to work as hybrids, and so serially combine a liquid electrolyte and a solid electrolyte to suppress unwanted redox shuttles. This adds new interfaces that might significantly decrease the cycling-rate capability. Here we show that the interface between a typical fast-ion-conducting solid electrolyte and a conventional liquid electrolyte is chemically unstable and forms a resistive solid-liquid electrolyte interphase (SLEI). Insights into the kinetics of this new type of interphase are obtained by impedance studies of a two-chamber cell. The chemistry of the SLEI, its growth with time and the influence of water impurities are examined by state-of-the-art surface analysis and depth profiling. Li+-selective solid electrolytes may enable next-generation battery systems, such as Li–S and Li–O2. Now, in an exemplar system, it is shown that a resistive interphase forms at the interface between solid and liquid electrolytes, termed the solid-liquid electrolyte interphase (SLEI). An in situ study of this undesirable effect is supported by state-of-the-art surface analysis.

Title: 
Water vibrations have strongly mixed intra- and intermolecular character

The ability of liquid water to dissipate energy efficiently through ultrafast vibrational relaxation plays a key role in the stabilization of reactive intermediates and the outcome of aqueous chemical reactions. The vibrational couplings that govern energy relaxation in H2O remain difficult to characterize because of the limitations of current methods to visualize inter- and intramolecular motions simultaneously. Using a new sub-70&nbsp;fs broadband mid-infrared source, we performed two-dimensional infrared, transient absorption and polarization anisotropy spectroscopy of H2O by exciting the OH stretching transition and characterizing the response from 1,350&nbsp;cm−1 to 4,000&nbsp;cm−1. These spectra reveal vibrational transitions at all frequencies simultaneous to the excitation, including pronounced cross-peaks to the bend vibration and a continuum of induced absorptions to combination bands that are not present in linear spectra. These observations provide evidence for strong mixing of inter- and intramolecular vibrations in liquid H2O, and illustrate the shortcomings of traditional relaxation models. Liquid water has the unique ability to mediate ultrafast energy transfer and relaxation in aqueous chemical reactions. Ultrafast broadband two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy that probes vibrations spanning the mid-infrared region with sub-70-femtosecond time resolution now provides evidence for highly intertwined intra- and intermolecular vibrations in water that act to efficiently dissipate vibrational energy.

Title: 
Cytosolic antibody delivery by lipid-sensitive endosomolytic peptide

One of the major obstacles in intracellular targeting using antibodies is their limited release from endosomes into the cytosol. Here we report an approach to deliver proteins, which include antibodies, into cells by using endosomolytic peptides derived from the cationic and membrane-lytic spider venom peptide M-lycotoxin. The delivery peptides were developed by introducing one or two glutamic acid residues into the hydrophobic face. One peptide with the substitution of leucine by glutamic acid (L17E) was shown to enable a marked cytosolic liberation of antibodies (immunoglobulins G (IgGs)) from endosomes. The predominant membrane-perturbation mechanism of this peptide is the preferential disruption of negatively charged membranes (endosomal membranes) over neutral membranes (plasma membranes), and the endosomolytic peptide promotes the uptake by inducing macropinocytosis. The fidelity of this approach was confirmed through the intracellular delivery of a ribosome-inactivation protein (saporin), Cre recombinase and IgG delivery, which resulted in a specific labelling of the cytosolic proteins and subsequent suppression of the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription. We also demonstrate the L17E-mediated cytosolic delivery of exosome-encapsulated proteins. The trapping of antibodies in endosomes often limits their use for intracellular targeting. Now, a single amino acid substitution on a spider-venom peptide has been shown to attenuate the cell membrane lytic activity and enables the selective rupturing of endosomal membranes. The peptide can be used to facilitate the escape of antibodies from endosomes into the cytosol.

Dynamic undocking and the quasi-bound state as tools for drug discovery

There is a pressing need for new technologies that improve the efficacy and efficiency of drug discovery. Structure-based methods have contributed towards this goal but they focus on predicting the binding affinity of protein–ligand complexes, which is notoriously difficult. We adopt an alternative approach that evaluates structural, rather than thermodynamic, stability. As bioactive molecules present a static binding mode, we devised dynamic undocking (DUck), a fast computational method to calculate the work necessary to reach a quasi-bound state at which the ligand has just broken the most important native contact with the receptor. This non-equilibrium property is surprisingly effective in virtual screening because true ligands form more-resilient interactions than decoys. Notably, DUck is orthogonal to docking and other ‘thermodynamic’ methods. We demonstrate the potential of the docking–undocking combination in a fragment screening against the molecular chaperone and oncology target Hsp90, for which we obtain novel chemotypes and a hit rate that approaches 40%. Structure-based drug design has generally focused on calculating binding free energies of protein–ligand complexes. It has now been shown that structural, rather than thermodynamic, stability — specifically, the work necessary to reach a quasi-bound state in which the ligand has just broken the most important contact with the receptor — can be calculated and used as a tool in virtual screening.

Main-chain metallopolymers at the static–dynamic boundary based on nickelocene

Interactions between metal ions and ligands in metal-containing polymers involve two bonding extremes: persistent covalent bonding, in which the polymers are essentially static in nature, or labile coordination bonding, which leads to dynamic supramolecular materials. Main-chain polymetallocenes based on ferrocene and cobaltocene fall into the former category because of the presence of strong metal–cyclopentadienyl bonds. Herein, we describe a main-chain polynickelocene—formed by ring-opening polymerization of a moderately strained [3]nickelocenophane monomer—that can be switched between static and dynamic states because of the relatively weak nickel–cyclopentadienyl ligand interactions. This is illustrated by the observation that, at a low concentration or at an elevated temperature in a coordinating or polar solvent, depolymerization of the polynickelocene occurs. A study of this dynamic polymer–monomer equilibrium by 1H NMR spectroscopy allowed the determination of the associated thermodynamic parameters. Microrheology data, however, indicated that under similar conditions the polynickelocene is considered to be static on the shorter rheological timescale. Main-chain polymetallocenes are typically static in nature due to strong metal–ligand bonding. Now, it has been shown that such polymers based on nickelocene are dynamic due to weaker nickel–cyclopentadienyl interactions, and at low concentration or at elevated temperature, depolymerization to the moderately strained monomer occurs.

Extremely rapid self-reaction of the simplest Criegee intermediate CH2OO and its implications in atmospheric chemistry

Criegee intermediates, which are carbonyl oxides produced when ozone reacts with unsaturated hydrocarbons, play an important role in the formation of OH and organic acids in the atmosphere, but they have eluded direct detection until recently. Reactions that involve Criegee intermediates are not understood fully because data based on their direct observation are limited. We used transient infrared absorption spectroscopy to probe directly the decay kinetics of formaldehyde oxide (CH2OO) and found that it reacts with itself extremely rapidly. This fast self-reaction is a result of its zwitterionic character. According to our quantum-chemical calculations, a cyclic dimeric intermediate that has the terminal O atom of one CH2OO bonded to the C atom of the other CH2OO is formed with large exothermicity before further decomposition to 2H2CO&nbsp;+&nbsp;O2(1Δg). We suggest that the inclusion of this previously overlooked rapid reaction in models may affect the interpretation of previous laboratory experiments that involve Criegee intermediates. Criegee intermediates play an important role in atmospheric chemistry but their direct study has proved difficult. Transient infrared absorption spectroscopy has now been used to probe the decay kinetics of the Criegee intermediate CH2OO directly, revealing that its self-reaction is extremely rapid. This may have important consequences for the interpretation of previous laboratory experiments.

A stable compound of helium and sodium at high pressure

Helium is generally understood to be chemically inert and this is due to its extremely stable closed-shell electronic configuration, zero electron affinity and an unsurpassed ionization potential. It is not known to form thermodynamically stable compounds, except a few inclusion compounds. Here, using the ab initio evolutionary algorithm USPEX and subsequent high-pressure synthesis in a diamond anvil cell, we report the discovery of a thermodynamically stable compound of helium and sodium, Na2He, which has a fluorite-type structure and is stable at pressures &gt;113 GPa. We show that the presence of He atoms causes strong electron localization and makes this material insulating. This phase is an electride, with electron pairs localized in interstices, forming eight-centre two-electron bonds within empty Na8 cubes. We also predict the existence of Na2HeO with a similar structure at pressures above 15 GPa. Helium is generally recognized as being chemically inert. A thermodynamically stable compound of helium and sodium, Na2He, has been predicted computationally and then synthesized at high pressure. It exists as an electride, where strongly localized electrons serve as anions located at the centre of Na8 cubes.

Prebiotic synthesis of simple sugars by photoredox systems chemistry

A recent synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides under prebiotically plausible conditions relied on mixed oxygenous and nitrogenous systems chemistry. As it stands, this synthesis provides support for the involvement of RNA in the origin of life, but such support would be considerably strengthened if the sugar building blocks for the synthesis—glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde—could be shown to derive from one carbon feedstock molecules using similarly mixed oxygenous and nitrogenous systems chemistry. Here, we show that these sugars can be formed from hydrogen cyanide by ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of cyanometallates in a remarkable systems chemistry process. Using copper cyanide complexes, the process operates catalytically to disproportionate hydrogen cyanide, first generating the sugars and then sequestering them as simple derivatives. A demonstration of simple sugar synthesis from single carbon feedstocks would provide significant support for the involvement of RNA in the origin of life. Here, hydrogen cyanide is shown to feed a cyanocuprate photoredox cycle that ultimately provides both the starting material and the reducing power necessary for a Killiani–Fischer-type sugar synthesis.

Controlled membrane translocation provides a mechanism for signal transduction and amplification

Transmission and amplification of chemical signals across lipid bilayer membranes is of profound significance in many biological processes, from the development of multicellular organisms to information processing in the nervous system. In biology, membrane-spanning proteins are responsible for the transmission of chemical signals across membranes, and signal transduction is often associated with an amplified signalling cascade. The ability to reproduce such processes in artificial systems has potential applications in sensing, controlled drug delivery and communication between compartments in tissue-like constructs of synthetic vesicles. Here we describe a mechanism for transmitting a chemical signal across a membrane based on the controlled translocation of a synthetic molecular transducer from one side of a lipid bilayer membrane to the other. The controlled molecular motion has been coupled to the activation of a catalyst on the inside of a vesicle, which leads to a signal-amplification process analogous to the biological counterpart. The transmission of chemical information across lipid bilayer membranes is crucial in biological systems. Now, an artificial chemical system able to both transduce and amplify chemical signals across a membrane has been developed. The system works by exploiting the controlled translocation of a synthetic molecule that is embedded within a vesicle membrane.

In situ X-ray snapshot analysis of transient molecular adsorption in a crystalline channel

Molecular adsorption is a fundamental phenomenon in porous materials and is usually characterized by the efficiency and selectivity of molecular separations and reactions. However, for functional porous materials, analysis of the dynamic behaviour of molecular adsorbents is a major challenge. Here, we use in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction to analyse multi-step molecular adsorption in a crystalline nanochannel of a metal-macrocycle framework. The pore surface of the metal-macrocycle framework crystal contains five different enantiomerically paired binding pockets, to which the adsorption of a (1R)-1-(3-chlorophenyl)ethanol solution was monitored with time. The resulting X-ray snapshot analyses suggest that the guest adsorption process takes a two-step pathway before equilibrium, in which the guest molecule is temporarily trapped by a neighbouring binding site. This demonstrates the potential for using X-ray analyses to visualize a transient state during a non-covalent self-assembly process. Analysing the dynamic adsorption of small molecules in porous materials is a significant challenge. Now, in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction has shown that molecular adsorption in a crystalline nanochannel occurs through multiple steps. Transient states during the process were also visualized, demonstrating the potential of X-ray analysis for probing non-covalent adsorption processes.

A switching cascade of hydrazone-based rotary switches through coordination-coupled proton relays

Imidazole, a subunit of histidine, plays a crucial role in proton-relay processes that are important for various biological activities, such as metal efflux, viral replication and photosynthesis. We show here how an imidazolyl ring incorporated into a rotary switch based on a hydrazone enables a switching cascade that involves proton relay between two different switches. The switching process starts with a single input, zinc(II), that initiates an E/Z isomerization in the hydrazone system through a coordination-coupled proton transfer. The resulting imidazolium ring is unusually acidic and, through proton relay, activates the E/Z isomerization of a non-coordinating pyridine-containing hydrazone switch. We hypothesize that the reduction in the acid dissociation constant of the imidazolium ring results from a combination of electrostatic and conformational effects, the study of which might help elucidate the proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanism in photosynthetic bacteria. Metal cations play an important role in biological proton relays by modulating the pKa values of surrounding amino acids. This effect has now been used to induce the isomerization of two hydrazone switches using a single input. It is found that a combination of electrostatic repulsion and conformational changes are required for the proton relay to take place.

Asymmetric assembly of aldose carbohydrates from formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde by tandem biocatalytic aldol reactions

The preparation of multifunctional chiral molecules can be greatly simplified by adopting a route via the sequential catalytic assembly of achiral building blocks. The catalytic aldol assembly of prebiotic compounds into stereodefined pentoses and hexoses is an as yet unmet challenge. Such a process would be of remarkable synthetic utility and highly significant with regard to the origin of life. Pursuing an expedient enzymatic approach, here we use engineered D-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase from Escherichia coli to prepare a series of three- to six-carbon aldoses by sequential one-pot additions of glycolaldehyde. Notably, the pertinent selection of the aldolase variant provides control of the sugar size. The stereochemical outcome of the addition was also altered to allow the synthesis of L-glucose and related derivatives. Such engineered biocatalysts may offer new routes for the straightforward synthesis of natural molecules and their analogues that circumvent the intricate enzymatic pathways forged by evolution. Forged by evolution, the natural enzymatic pathways to aldose carbohydrates are complex. Now, a biocatalytic stereoselective one-pot assembly of these carbohydrates from formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde using engineered D-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase (FSA) variants has been developed that circumvents this complexity.

Molecular tweezers modulate 14-3-3 protein–protein interactions

Supramolecular chemistry has recently emerged as a promising way to modulate protein functions, but devising molecules that will interact with a protein in the desired manner is difficult as many competing interactions exist in a biological environment (with solvents, salts or different sites for the target biomolecule). We now show that lysine-specific molecular tweezers bind to a 14-3-3 adapter protein and modulate its interaction with partner proteins. The tweezers inhibit binding between the 14-3-3 protein and two partner proteins—a phosphorylated (C-Raf) protein and an unphosphorylated one (ExoS)—in a concentration-dependent manner. Protein crystallography shows that this effect arises from the binding of the tweezers to a single surface-exposed lysine (Lys214) of the 14-3-3 protein in the proximity of its central channel, which normally binds the partner proteins. A combination of structural analysis and computer simulations provides rules for the tweezers' binding preferences, thus allowing us to predict their influence on this type of protein–protein interactions. A molecular tweezer has been shown to bind to the surface of a 14-3-3 protein through a particular lysine residue. This interaction — characterized in detail by protein crystallography and computational modelling — disrupts the protein's binding with partner proteins. These findings ascertain supramolecular chemistry as an enticing tool in chemical biology, here towards modulating protein functions.

Colloidal inverse bicontinuous cubic membranes of block copolymers with tunable surface functional groups

Analogous to the complex membranes found in cellular organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, the inverse cubic mesophases of lipids and their colloidal forms (cubosomes) possess internal networks of water channels arranged in crystalline order, which provide a unique nanospace for membrane-protein crystallization and guest encapsulation. Polymeric analogues of cubosomes formed by the direct self-assembly of block copolymers in solution could provide new polymeric mesoporous materials with a three-dimensionally organized internal maze of large water channels. Here we report the self-assembly of amphiphilic dendritic–linear block copolymers into polymer cubosomes in aqueous solution. The presence of precisely defined bulky dendritic blocks drives the block copolymers to form spontaneously highly curved bilayers in aqueous solution. This results in the formation of colloidal inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases. The internal networks of water channels provide a high surface area with tunable surface functional groups that can serve as anchoring points for large guests such as proteins and enzymes. Colloidal inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases have now been formed by self-assembly of amphiphilic dendritic-linear block copolymers in solution. The internal networks of water channels provide a high surface area with tunable functional groups that can serve as anchoring points for macromolecular guests such as proteins and enzymes.

The role of LiO2 solubility in O2 reduction in aprotic solvents and its consequences for Li–O2 batteries

When lithium–oxygen batteries discharge, O2 is reduced at the cathode to form solid Li2O2. Understanding the fundamental mechanism of O2 reduction in aprotic solvents is therefore essential to realizing their technological potential. Two different models have been proposed for Li2O2 formation, involving either solution or electrode surface routes. Here, we describe a single unified mechanism, which, unlike previous models, can explain O2 reduction across the whole range of solvents and for which the two previous models are limiting cases. We observe that the solvent influences O2 reduction through its effect on the solubility of LiO2, or, more precisely, the free energy of the reaction LiO2* ⇌ Li(sol)+ + O2−(sol) + ion pairs + higher aggregates (clusters). The unified mechanism shows that low-donor-number solvents are likely to lead to premature cell death, and that the future direction of research for lithium–oxygen batteries should focus on the search for new, stable, high-donor-number electrolytes, because they can support higher capacities and can better sustain discharge. The mechanism of O2 reduction in aprotic solvents is important for the operation of Li–O2 batteries but is not well understood. A single unified mechanism is now described that regards previous models as limiting cases. It shows that the solubility of the intermediate LiO2 is a critical factor that dictates the mechanism, emphasizing the importance of the solvent.

A stable heavier group 14 analogue of vinylidene

Vinylidene (H2C=C) is a member of the family of compounds of composition CH (and isomeric with ethyne, HC≡CH), but it has been observed only transiently—with a lifetime in the region of 0.1 ns. Indeed, no simple (non-base-stabilized) compounds of the type R2E=E have been characterized structurally for any of the group 14 elements. Here we show that by employing the bulky and strongly electron-donating boryl ligand (HCDippN)2B (Dipp, 2,6-iPr2C6H3), a simple monomeric digermavinylidene compound, (boryl)2GeGe, can be synthesized and is stable at room temperature. Both its formation via the two-electron chemical oxidation of the symmetrical Ge0 compound K2[(boryl)GeGe(boryl)] and its subsequent reaction chemistry (for example, with H2), are consistent with a high substituent lability and the accessibility of both 1,1- and 1,2-substitution patterns. Structural and computational studies of [(HCDippN)2B]2GeGe reveal a weak Ge–Ge double bond—the π component of which contributes to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)—with a Ge-centred lone pair as the HOMO–1. Vinylidene, (H2C=C), is a short-lived structural isomer of acetylene. By employing bulky and strongly electron-donating boryl co-ligands, the synthesis of an analogous group 14 vinylidene compound is reported. The digermavinylidene, {(HCDippN)2B}2GeGe, (where Dipp = 2,6-iPr2C6H3), is synthesized via oxidation of the corresponding symmetrical Ge0 compound K2[(boryl)GeGe(boryl)].

Programmable autonomous synthesis of single-stranded DNA

DNA performs diverse functional roles in biology, nanotechnology and biotechnology, but current methods for autonomously synthesizing arbitrary single-stranded DNA are limited. Here, we introduce the concept of primer exchange reaction (PER) cascades, which grow nascent single-stranded DNA with user-specified sequences following prescribed reaction pathways. PER synthesis happens in a programmable, autonomous, in situ and environmentally responsive fashion, providing a platform for engineering molecular circuits and devices with a wide range of sensing, monitoring, recording, signal-processing and actuation capabilities. We experimentally demonstrate a nanodevice that transduces the detection of a trigger RNA into the production of a DNAzyme that degrades an independent RNA substrate, a signal amplifier that conditionally synthesizes long fluorescent strands only in the presence of a particular RNA signal, molecular computing circuits that evaluate logic (AND, OR, NOT) combinations of RNA inputs, and a temporal molecular event recorder that records in the PER transcript the order in which distinct RNA inputs are sequentially detected. Primer exchange reaction (PER) cascades have now been used to grow nascent single-stranded DNA with user-specified sequences following prescribed reaction pathways. PER synthesis occurs in a programmable, autonomous, in situ and environmentally responsive fashion, providing a platform for engineering molecular circuits and devices with a wide range of sensing, monitoring, recording, signal processing and actuation capabilities.

Direct probe of spectral inhomogeneity reveals synthetic tunability of single-nanocrystal spectral linewidths

The spectral linewidth of an ensemble of fluorescent emitters is dictated by the combination of single-emitter linewidths and sample inhomogeneity. For semiconductor nanocrystals, efforts to tune ensemble linewidths for optical applications have focused primarily on eliminating sample inhomogeneities, because conventional single-molecule methods cannot reliably build accurate ensemble-level statistics for single-particle linewidths. Photon-correlation Fourier spectroscopy in solution (S-PCFS) offers a unique approach to investigating single-nanocrystal spectra with large sample statistics and high signal-to-noise ratios, without user selection bias and at fast timescales. With S-PCFS, we directly and quantitatively deconstruct the ensemble linewidth into contributions from the average single-particle linewidth and from sample inhomogeneity. We demonstrate that single-particle linewidths vary significantly from batch to batch and can be synthetically controlled. These findings delineate the synthetic challenges facing underdeveloped nanomaterials such as InP and InAs core–shell particles and introduce new avenues for the synthetic optimization of fluorescent nanoparticles. The average single-nanocrystal spectral linewidth&nbsp;within an ensemble of nanocrystal emitters in solution can be directly and quantitatively measured using photon-correlation Fourier spectroscopy (S-PCFS). Variations in single-nanocrystal linewidths between batches are found to be significant and synthetically tunable, introducing new avenues for the optimization of nanocrystals for optical applications.

Control of ultrafast molecular photodissociation by laser-field-induced potentials

Experiments aimed at understanding ultrafast molecular processes are now routine, and the notion that external laser fields can constitute an additional reagent is also well established. The possibility of externally controlling a reaction with radiation increases immensely when its intensity is sufficiently high to distort the potential energy surfaces at which chemists conceptualize reactions take place. Here we explore the transition from the weak- to the strong-field regimes of laser control for the dissociation of a polyatomic molecule, methyl iodide. The control over the yield of the photodissociation reaction proceeds through the creation of a light-induced conical intersection. The control of the velocity of the product fragments requires external fields with both high intensities and short durations. This is because the mechanism by which control is exerted involves modulating the potentials around the light-induced conical intersection, that is, creating light-induced potentials. Shaping potential energy surfaces by tailored strong laser pulses has now been shown to be a powerful method for controlling product yields in an ultrafast polyatomic photodissociation reaction. Control over the velocity of the product fragments is also achieved through the generation of light-induced conical intersections and modulating the potentials around them.

Precision design of ethylene- and polar-monomer-based copolymers by organometallic-mediated radical polymerization

The copolymerization of ethylene with polar monomers is a major challenge when it comes to the manufacture of materials with potential for a wide range of commercial applications. In the chemical industry, free-radical polymerization is used to make a large proportion of such copolymers, but the forcing conditions result in a lack of fine control over the architecture of the products. Herein we introduce a synthetic tool, effective under mild experimental conditions, for the precision design of unprecedented ethylene- and polar-monomer-based copolymers. We demonstrate how an organocobalt species can control the growth of the copolymer chains, their composition and the monomer distribution throughout the chain. By fine tuning the ethylene pressure during polymerization and by exploiting a unique reactive mode of the end of the organometallic chain, novel block-like copolymer structures can be prepared. This highly versatile synthetic platform provides access to a diverse range of polymer materials. Copolymers of ethylene and polar monomers are produced industrially using free radical polymerization that leads to broad molecular weight distributions of products with ill-defined structures. Now, an organo–cobalt complex is shown to control the radical copolymerization of ethylene with polar monomers under mild experimental conditions, and allows access to block-like copolymers with targeted compositions and monomer distributions.

Title: 
Wide-dynamic-range kinetic investigations of deep proton tunnelling in proteins

Directional proton transport along ‘wires’ that feed biochemical reactions in proteins is poorly understood. Amino-acid residues with high pKa are seldom considered as active transport elements in such wires because of their large classical barrier for proton dissociation. Here, we use the light-triggered proton wire of the green fluorescent protein to study its ground-electronic-state proton-transport kinetics, revealing a large temperature-dependent kinetic isotope effect. We show that ‘deep’ proton tunnelling between hydrogen-bonded oxygen atoms with a typical donor–acceptor distance of 2.7–2.8 Å fully accounts for the rates at all temperatures, including the unexpectedly large value (2.5 × 109 s−1) found at room temperature. The rate-limiting step in green fluorescent protein is assigned to tunnelling of the ionization-resistant serine hydroxyl proton. This suggests how high-pKa residues within a proton wire can act as a ‘tunnel diode’ to kinetically trap protons and control the direction of proton flow. A temperature-dependent kinetic study of ground-state proton transfer in the green fluorescent protein highlights the role of ‘deep tunnelling’ in proton wires. A potential mechanism for directional proton transport is proposed, where high-pKa amino acid residues act as ‘tunnel diodes’ and as stabilizing elements within protein water wires.

Mechanically induced chemiluminescence from polymers incorporating a 1,2-dioxetane unit in the main chain

Nature uses mechanochemical transduction processes to achieve diverse and vital functions, such as hearing, cellular adhesion and gating of ion channels. One fascinating example of biological mechanotransduction is the emission of light on mechanical stimulation. However, molecular-level transduction of force into luminescence in a synthetic system remains a challenge. Here, we show that bis(adamantyl)-1,2-dioxetane emits visible light when force is applied to a polymer chain or network in which this unit is incorporated. Bright-blue luminescence was observed on sonication of solutions of dioxetane-containing linear polymers and on the straining of polymer networks with dioxetane crosslinkers. Light is emitted from the adamantanone-excited state that forms on opening of the four-membered dioxetane ring. Increased sensitivity and colour tuning were achieved by energy transfer to suitable acceptors. High spatial and temporal resolutions highlight the potential to study the failure of polymeric materials in unprecedented detail. Bisadamantyl 1,2-dioxetane is a luminescent mechanophore that, when incorporated into polymer chains or networks, emits visible light when its 4-membered ring is opened by sonication in solution or by deformation of a bulk sample. This phenomenon mimics biological mechanoluminescence and highlights the potential to study the failure of polymeric materials with high spatial and temporal resolution.

Title: 
Force-induced tautomerization in a single molecule

Heat transfer, electrical potential and light energy are common ways to activate chemical reactions. Applied force is another way, but dedicated studies for such a mechanical activation are limited, and this activation is poorly understood at the single-molecule level. Here, we report force-induced tautomerization in a single porphycene molecule on a Cu(110) surface at 5 K, which is studied by scanning probe microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Force spectroscopy quantifies the force needed to trigger tautomerization with submolecular spatial resolution. The calculations show how the reaction pathway and barrier of tautomerization are modified in the presence of a copper tip and reveal the atomistic origin of the process. Moreover, we demonstrate that a chemically inert tip whose apex is terminated by a xenon atom cannot induce the reaction because of a weak interaction with porphycene and a strong relaxation of xenon on the tip as contact to the molecule is formed. Force-induced tautomerization in a single porphycene molecule is investigated on a Cu(110) surface at 5 K by using non-contact atomic force microscopy. The force needed to trigger the tautomerization process is quantified by force spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal the atomistic mechanism behind the reaction.

Title: 
A ‘clusters-in-liquid’ method for calculating infrared spectra identifies the proton-transfer mode in acidic aqueous solutions

In liquid water the transfer of an excess proton between two water molecules occurs through the Zundel cation, H2O···H+···OH2. The proton-transfer mode is the asymmetric stretch of the central O···H+···O moiety, but there is no consensus on its identification in the infrared spectra of acidic aqueous solutions. Also, in experiments with protonated gas-phase water clusters, its position shifts with cluster size, which makes its relationship with solution spectra unclear. Here we introduce a ‘clusters-in-liquid’ approach for calculating the infrared spectrum from any set of charges, even single protons. We apply this procedure to multistate empirical valence-bond trajectories of protonated liquid water and to ab initio molecular dynamics of the protonated water dimer and hexamer in the gas phase. The calculated proton-transfer mode is manifested in both systems as a peak near 1,740&nbsp;cm−1, in quantitative agreement with a band of similar frequency in the experimental infrared spectrum of protonated water clusters. The infrared spectra of gas-phase protonated water clusters and protonated liquid water have been calculated from molecular simulations using a ‘clusters-in-liquid’ approach, which is restricted to a selected set of charged atoms. The infrared absorption due to the central proton in the H2O···H+···OH2 moiety is found near 1,740&nbsp;cm−1.

Title: 
Two-stage directed self-assembly of a cyclic [3]catenane

Interlocked molecules possess properties and functions that depend upon their intricate connectivity. In addition to the topologically trivial rotaxanes, whose structures may be captured by a planar graph, the topologically non-trivial knots and catenanes represent some of chemistry's most challenging synthetic targets because of the three-dimensional assembly necessary for their construction. Here we report the synthesis of a cyclic [3]catenane, which consists of three mutually interpenetrating rings, via an unusual synthetic route. Five distinct building blocks self-assemble into a heteroleptic triangular framework composed of two joined FeII3L3 circular helicates. Subcomponent exchange then enables specific points in the framework to be linked together to generate the cyclic [3]catenane product. Our method represents an advance both in the intricacy of the metal-templated self-assembly procedure and in the use of selective imine exchange to generate a topologically complex product. Interlocked molecules represent some of the most challenging synthetic targets in terms of non-natural products. It has now been demonstrated how a cyclic [3]catenane composed of three mutually interpenetrating rings can be prepared in two stages using a selective imine exchange reaction on a self-assembled triangular precursor.

Title: 
Cooperative carbon-atom abstraction from alkenes in the core of a pentanuclear nickel cluster

Although the cleavage of C–C bonds in unactivated hydrocarbons by soluble transition-metal complexes remains a challenge, such reactions hold the potential to provide access to previously inconceivable skeletal transformations. For instance, one can imagine the dismantling and reassembly of C–C and C–H bonds commonly observed in surface catalysis, but with the increased control innate to homogeneous catalysis. Here we report a pentanuclear nickel cluster that is unreactive to functional groups, such as alcohols, amines and even water, but selectively cleaves the C=C bonds of simple alkenes, such as ethylene, styrene and isobutylene, at temperatures as low as −30 °C and in near-quantitative yields. The isolation of intermediates in reactions with styrene and isobutylene demonstrates that the five nickel centres cooperatively activate three C–H bonds of the alkene substrate before cleaving the C–C bond in the core of the cluster to give a pentanuclear nickel carbide. The net organic product transformation is the abstraction of a carbon atom from an alkene. Interest in surface-mediated chemistry has led to the design of small molecule models for surfaces, which provide mechanistic insight and have practical applications. Now, the cooperative behaviour of five nickel centres has been shown to provide reactivity reminiscent of highly active metal surface sites, leading to carbon-atom abstraction from alkenes under ambient conditions.

Reversible S-nitrosylation in an engineered azurin

S-Nitrosothiols are known as reagents for NO storage and transportation and as regulators in many physiological processes. Although the S-nitrosylation catalysed by haem proteins is well known, no direct evidence of S-nitrosylation in copper proteins has been reported. Here, we report reversible insertion of NO into a copper–thiolate bond in an engineered copper centre in Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin by rational design of the primary coordination sphere and tuning its reduction potential by deleting a hydrogen bond in the secondary coordination sphere. The results not only provide the first direct evidence of S-nitrosylation of Cu(II)-bound cysteine in metalloproteins, but also shed light on the reaction mechanism and structural features responsible for stabilizing the elusive Cu(I)–S(Cys)NO species. The fast, efficient and reversible S-nitrosylation reaction is used to demonstrate its ability to prevent NO inhibition of cytochrome bo3 oxidase activity by competing for NO binding with the native enzyme under physiologically relevant conditions. S-Nitrosylation has emerged as an important pathway for dynamic post-translational regulation of many classes of proteins. Now, the reversible insertion of NO into a copper–thiolate bond has been observed under physiologically relevant conditions using an engineered azurin. DFT calculation indicates that the reaction proceeds via a radical combination mechanism.

Title: 
Molecular hydrogen interacts more strongly when rotationally excited at low temperatures leading to faster reactions

The role of internal molecular degrees of freedom, such as rotation, has scarcely been explored experimentally in low-energy collisions despite their significance to cold and ultracold chemistry. Particularly important to astrochemistry is the case of the most abundant molecule in interstellar space, hydrogen, for which two spin isomers have been detected, one of which exists in its rotational ground state whereas the other is rotationally excited. Here we demonstrate that quantization of molecular rotation plays a key role in cold reaction dynamics, where rotationally excited ortho-hydrogen reacts faster due to a stronger long-range attraction. We observe rotational state-dependent non-Arrhenius universal scaling laws in chemi-ionization reactions of para-H2 and ortho-H2 by He(23P2), spanning three orders of magnitude in temperature. Different scaling laws serve as a sensitive gauge that enables us to directly determine the exact nature of the long-range intermolecular interactions. Our results show that the quantum state of the molecular rotor determines whether or not anisotropic long-range interactions dominate cold collisions. The rotational state of a molecule is not generally considered to play a role in how fast it reacts; however, when the temperature is low quantum effects become more important. Now, it is shown that at low temperatures rotationally excited H2 molecules react with He faster than non-rotating ground-state molecules — a process mediated by stronger long-range attraction.

Decoupling hydrogen and oxygen evolution during electrolytic water splitting using an electron-coupled-proton buffer

Hydrogen is essential to several key industrial processes and could play a major role as an energy carrier in a future ‘hydrogen economy’. Although the majority of the world's hydrogen supply currently comes from the reformation of fossil fuels, its generation from water using renewables-generated power could provide a hydrogen source without increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. Conventional water electrolysis produces H2 and O2 simultaneously, such that these gases must be generated in separate spaces to prevent their mixing. Herein, using the polyoxometalate H3PMo12O40, we introduce the concept of the electron-coupled-proton buffer (ECPB), whereby O2 and H2 can be produced at separate times during water electrolysis. This could have advantages in preventing gas mixing in the headspaces of high-pressure electrolysis cells, with implications for safety and electrolyser degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that temporally separated O2 and H2 production allows greater flexibility regarding the membranes and electrodes that can be used in water-splitting cells. Using a polyoxometalate as an electron-coupled-proton buffer, the decoupling of the water oxidation and proton reduction half reactions of electrolytic water splitting is achieved. This allows O2 and H2 to be produced separately in both time and space. The implications of these findings for electrolyser design and low-cost hydrogen production from water are discussed.

Roaming-mediated ultrafast isomerization of geminal tri-bromides in the gas and liquid phases

‘Roaming’ is a new and unusual class of reaction mechanism that has recently been discovered in unimolecular dissociation reactions of isolated molecules in the gas phase. It is characterized by frustrated bond cleavage, after which the two incipient fragments ‘roam’ on a flat region of the potential energy surface before reacting with one another. Here, we provide evidence that supports roaming in the liquid phase. We are now able to explain previous solution-phase experiments by comparing them with new ultrafast transient absorption data showing the photoisomerization of gas-phase CHBr3. We see that, upon S0–S1 excitation, gas-phase CHBr3 isomerizes within 100 fs into the BrHCBr–Br species, which is identical to what has been observed in solution. Similar sub-100 fs isomerization is now also observed for BBr3 and PBr3 in solution upon S1 excitation. Quantum chemical simulations of XBr3 (X = B, P or CH) suggest that photochemical reactivity in all three cases studied is governed by S1/S0 conical intersections and can best be described as occurring through roaming-mediated pathways. Roaming — a new and unusual reaction mechanism in gas-phase chemical transformations — is now shown to occur in solution. Following ultraviolet excitation of geminal tribromides, what initially seems to be the simple fission of a bond is in fact isomerization occurring through the roaming of molecular fragments.

Extreme compressibility in LnFe(CN)6 coordination framework materials via molecular gears and torsion springs

The mechanical flexibility of coordination frameworks can lead to a range of highly anomalous structural behaviours. Here, we demonstrate the extreme compressibility of the LnFe(CN)6 frameworks (Ln = Ho, Lu or Y), which reversibly compress by 20% in volume under the relatively low pressure of 1 GPa, one of the largest known pressure responses for any crystalline material. We delineate in detail the mechanism for this high compressibility, where the LnN6 units act like torsion springs synchronized by rigid Fe(CN)6 units performing the role of gears. The materials also show significant negative linear compressibility via a cam-like effect. The torsional mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the deformation mechanisms prevalent in other flexible solids and relies on competition between locally unstable metal coordination geometries and the constraints of the framework connectivity, a discovery that has implications for the strategic design of new materials with exceptional mechanical properties. Highly compressible crystalline materials typically rely on the high compressibility of their chemical bonds. Now, a family of LnFe(CN)6 frameworks (Ln = Ho, Lu or Y) has been shown to exhibit pronounced volumetric and linear compressibilities through a spring-and-gear mechanism instead, in which a torsionally flexible LnN6 unit twists reversibly under pressure.

Synthesis and structure of solution-stable one-dimensional palladium wires

One-dimensional metal wires are valuable materials because of their optical and electronic anisotropy, and they have potential utility in devices such as photovoltaic cells and molecular sensors. However, despite more than a century of research, only a few examples exist of well-defined one-dimensional (1D) metal wires that allow for the rational variation of conductivity. Herein we describe the first examples of 1D molecular wires supported by Pd–Pd bonds, the thin-film conductive properties of which can be altered by controlled molecular changes. Wires based on Pd(III) give semiconducting films with a modifiable bandgap, whereas wires based on Pd(2.5) give films that display metallic conductivity above 200&nbsp;K: a metallic state has not been reported previously for any polymer composed of 1D metal wires. The wires are infinite in the solid state and maintain 1D structures in solution with lengths of up to 750&nbsp;nm. Solution stability enables thin film coating, a requisite for device fabrication using molecular wires. One-dimensional wires with metal–metal bonding have been studied for more than a century, but control over structure and properties has remained challenging. Here, palladium–palladium bonding is used to make one-dimensional wires with lengths of up to 750&nbsp;nm in solution, whose molecular structures can be rationally modified.

Quantitative self-assembly of a purely organic three-dimensional catenane in water

Self-assembly by means of coordinative bond formation has opened up opportunities for the high-yield synthesis of molecules with complex topologies. However, the preparation of purely covalent molecular architectures in aqueous media has remained a challenging task. Here, we present the preparation of a three-dimensional catenane through a self-assembly process that relies on the formation of dynamic hydrazone linkages in an acidic aqueous medium. The quantitative synthesis process and the mechanically interlocked structure of the resulting catenane were established by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography and HPLC studies. In addition, the labile hydrazone linkages of the individual [2]catenane components may be ‘locked’ by increasing the pH of the solution, yielding a relatively kinetically stable molecule. The present study thus details a simple approach to the creation and control of complex molecular architectures under reaction conditions that mimic biological milieux. Purely organic molecules with complex interlocked architectures have proved difficult to prepare in water. Now, a three-dimensional organic [2]catenane has been obtained in a weakly acidic aqueous solution, through an almost quantitative self-assembly process relying on dynamic hydrazone linkages. The catenane is kinetically stable in neutral and weakly basic environments.

Synthesis of a distinct water dimer inside fullerene C70

The water dimer is an ideal chemical species with which to study hydrogen bonds. Owing to the equilibrium between the monomer and oligomer structure, however, selective generation and separation of a genuine water dimer has not yet been achieved. Here, we report a synthetic strategy that leads to the successful encapsulation of one or two water molecules inside fullerene C70. These endohedral C70 compounds offer the opportunity to study the intrinsic properties of a single water molecule without any hydrogen bonding, as well as an isolated water dimer with a single hydrogen bond between the two molecules. The unambiguously determined off-centre position of water in (H2O)2@C70 by X-ray diffraction provides insights into the formation of (H2O)2@C70. Subsequently, the 1H NMR spectroscopic measurements for (H2O)2@C70 confirmed the formation of a single hydrogen bond rapidly interchanging between the encapsulated water dimer. Our theoretical calculations revealed a peculiar cis-linear conformation of the dimer resulting from confinement effects inside C70. Endohedral C70 fullerenes containing either one or two water molecules have now been prepared using a molecular-surgery approach. The structure of H2O@C70 was determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis, revealing the encapsulated water molecule to be in an off-centre position. In (H2O)2@C70, the two water molecules form a discrete dimer held together with a single hydrogen bond.

Multistep nucleation of nanocrystals in aqueous solution

The nucleation and growth of solids from solutions impacts many natural processes and is fundamental to applications in materials engineering and medicine. For a crystalline solid, the nucleus is a nanoscale cluster of ordered atoms that forms through mechanisms still poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear whether a nucleus forms spontaneously from solution via a single- or multiple-step process. Here, using in situ electron microscopy, we show how gold and silver nanocrystals nucleate from supersaturated aqueous solutions in three distinct steps: spinodal decomposition into solute-rich and solute-poor liquid phases, nucleation of amorphous nanoclusters within the metal-rich liquid phase, followed by crystallization of these amorphous clusters. Our ab initio calculations on gold nucleation suggest that these steps might be associated with strong gold–gold atom coupling and water-mediated metastable gold complexes. The understanding of intermediate steps in nuclei formation has important implications for the formation and growth of both crystalline and amorphous materials. Crystals grow from nuclei. In systems where nuclei are nanometre-sized and form quickly, it is difficult to determine the mechanism of their formation. Now, through in situ TEM, the demixing of a supersaturated aqueous gold solution into metastable gold-poor and gold-rich liquid phases is observed, the latter yielding stable clusters that become nuclei for nanocrystal growth.

Ligand-enabled multiple absolute stereocontrol in metal-catalysed cycloaddition for construction of contiguous all-carbon quaternary stereocentres

The development of a general catalytic method for the direct and stereoselective construction of contiguous all-carbon quaternary stereocentres remains a formidable challenge in chemical synthesis. Here, we report a highly enantio- and diastereoselective [3+2] annulation reaction of 5-vinyloxazolidinones and activated trisubstituted alkenes catalysed by a palladium complex bearing a newly devised phosphine ligand with a chiral ammonium salt component, which enables the single-step construction of three contiguous stereocentres, including vicinal all-carbon quaternary stereocentres, in a five-membered heterocyclic framework. This stereoselective cycloaddition protocol relies on the remarkable ability of the chiral ligand to rigorously control the absolute stereochemistry of each chiral centre associated with the multiple bond-forming events, and provides a reliable catalytic process for the asymmetric synthesis of densely functionalized pyrrolidines. A palladium-catalysed, highly enantio- and diastereoselective [3&nbsp;+&nbsp;2] cycloaddition reaction to produce densely functionalized pyrrolidine frameworks is developed by exploiting a new phosphine ligand with a chiral ammonium salt component. Rigorous control of the individual absolute stereochemistry of three contiguous stereocentres, including vicinal all-carbon quaternary stereocentres, is possible using this methodology.

Synthesis and characterization of hexaarylbenzenes with five or six different substituents enabled by programmed synthesis

Since its discovery in 1825, benzene has served as one of the most used and indispensable building blocks of chemical compounds, ranging from pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals to plastics and those used in organic electronic devices. Benzene has six hydrogen atoms that can each be replaced by different substituents, which means that the structural diversity of benzene derivatives is intrinsically extraordinary. The number of possible substituted benzenes from n different substituents is (2n + 2n2 + 4n3 + 3n4 + n6)/12. However, owing to a lack of general synthetic methods for making multisubstituted benzenes, this potentially huge structural diversity has not been fully exploited. Here, we describe a programmed synthesis of hexaarylbenzenes using C–H activation, cross-coupling and [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. The present method allows for the isolation and structure–property characterization of hexaarylbenzenes with distinctive aryl substituents at all positions for the first time. Moreover, the established protocol can be applied to the synthesis of tetraarylnaphthalenes and pentaarylpyridines. A lack of general methods for making multisubstituted benzene derivatives means that only a small fraction of the huge number of possible structures based on this ubiquitous building block have been explored. Now, a programmed synthesis of hexaarylbenzenes using C–H activation, cross-coupling and [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions has been developed that can also be applied to tetraarylnaphthalenes and pentaarylpyridines.

Synthesis facilitates an understanding of the structural basis for translation inhibition by the lissoclimides

The lissoclimides are unusual succinimide-containing labdane diterpenoids that were reported to be potent cytotoxins. Our short semisynthesis and analogue-oriented synthesis approaches provide a series of lissoclimide natural products and analogues that expand the structure–activity relationships (SARs) in this family. The semisynthesis approach yielded significant quantities of chlorolissoclimide (CL) to permit an evaluation against the National Cancer Institute's 60-cell line panel and allowed us to obtain an X-ray co-crystal structure of the synthetic secondary metabolite with the eukaryotic 80S ribosome. Although it shares a binding site with other imide-based natural product translation inhibitors, CL engages in a particularly interesting and novel face-on halogen–π interaction between the ligand's alkyl chloride and a guanine residue. Our analogue-oriented synthesis provides many more lissoclimide compounds, which were tested against aggressive human cancer cell lines and for protein synthesis inhibitory activity. Finally, computational modelling was used to explain the SARs of certain key compounds and set the stage for the structure-guided design of better translation inhibitors. Several natural and unnatural lissoclimide cytotoxins have been prepared via semi-synthesis and total synthesis. An X-ray co-crystal structure of chlorolissoclimide with the ribosome and evaluation of cytotoxicity and translation inhibition of new compounds in the series improves our understanding of the molecular basis for cytotoxicity.

Genetically encoded norbornene directs site-specific cellular protein labelling via a rapid bioorthogonal reaction

The site-specific incorporation of bioorthogonal groups via genetic code expansion provides a powerful general strategy for site-specifically labelling proteins with any probe. However, the slow reactivity of the bioorthogonal functional groups that can be encoded genetically limits the utility of this strategy. We demonstrate the genetic encoding of a norbornene amino acid using the pyrrolysyl tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells. We developed a series of tetrazine-based probes that exhibit ‘turn-on’ fluorescence on their rapid reaction with norbornenes. We demonstrate that the labelling of an encoded norbornene is specific with respect to the entire soluble E. coli proteome and thousands of times faster than established encodable bioorthogonal reactions. We show explicitly the advantages of this approach over state-of-the-art bioorthogonal reactions for protein labelling in vitro and on mammalian cells, and demonstrate the rapid bioorthogonal site-specific labelling of a protein on the mammalian cell surface. The site-specific incorporation of a norbornene amino acid into proteins via genetic code expansion, together with the synthesis of a series of tetrazine-based probes that exhibit turn-on fluorescence on their fast cycloaddition with norbornene, enables rapid protein labelling on mammalian cells.

Dynamic control of chirality and self-assembly of double-stranded helicates with light

Helicity switching in biological and artificial systems is a fundamental process that allows for the dynamic control of structures and their functions. In contrast to chemical approaches to responsive behaviour in helicates, the use of light as an external stimulus offers unique opportunities to invert the chirality of helical structures in a non-invasive manner with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, we report that unidirectional rotary motors with connecting oligobipyridyl ligands, which can dynamically change their chirality upon irradiation, assemble into metal helicates that are responsive to light. The motor function controls the self-assembly process as well as the helical chirality, allowing switching between oligomers and double-stranded helicates with distinct handedness. The unidirectionality of the light-induced motion governs the sequence of programmable steps, enabling the highly regulated self-assembly of fully responsive helical structures. This discovery paves the way for the future development of new chirality-dependent photoresponsive systems including smart materials, enantioselective catalysts and light-driven molecular machines. Switching the chirality of helicates non-invasively is challenging, even though helicates were discovered some decades ago. Now, by incorporating a light-driven molecular motor into a Cu(I)-helicate, the chirality of the metal helicate as well as the assembly and disassembly processes can be switched non-invasively by light and heat.

A clamp-like biohybrid catalyst for DNA oxidation

In processive catalysis, a catalyst binds to a substrate and remains bound as it performs several consecutive reactions, as exemplified by DNA polymerases. Processivity is essential in nature and is often mediated by a clamp-like structure that physically tethers the catalyst to its (polymeric) template. In the case of the bacteriophage T4 replisome, a dedicated clamp protein acts as a processivity mediator by encircling DNA and subsequently recruiting its polymerase. Here we use this DNA-binding protein to construct a biohybrid catalyst. Conjugation of the clamp protein to a chemical catalyst with sequence-specific oxidation behaviour formed a catalytic clamp that can be loaded onto a DNA plasmid. The catalytic activity of the biohybrid catalyst was visualized using a procedure based on an atomic force microscopy method that detects and spatially locates oxidized sites in DNA. Varying the experimental conditions enabled switching between processive and distributive catalysis and influencing the sliding direction of this rotaxane-like catalyst. Clamp proteins that encircle DNA and then recruit enzymes are one of nature's ways of making catalysis on DNA processive. Here, a clamp protein is equipped with a synthetic catalyst that sequence-specifically oxidizes DNA. The resulting biohybrid catalyst shows processive behaviour, which is visualized by atomic force microscopy.

Organocatalytic removal of formaldehyde adducts from RNA and DNA bases

Formaldehyde is universally used to fix tissue specimens, where it forms hemiaminal and aminal adducts with biomolecules, hindering the ability to retrieve molecular information. Common methods for removing these adducts involve extended heating, which can cause extensive degradation of nucleic acids, particularly RNA. Here, we show that water-soluble bifunctional catalysts (anthranilates and phosphanilates) speed the reversal of formaldehyde adducts of mononucleotides over standard buffers. Studies with formaldehyde-treated RNA oligonucleotides show that the catalysts enhance adduct removal, restoring unmodified RNA at 37 °C even when extensively modified, while avoiding the high temperatures that promote RNA degradation. Experiments with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell samples show that the catalysis is compatible with common RNA extraction protocols, with detectable RNA yields increased by 1.5–2.4-fold using a catalyst under optimized conditions and by 7–25-fold compared with a commercial kit. Such catalytic strategies show promise for general use in reversing formaldehyde adducts in clinical specimens. Formaldehyde is universally employed in the fixation of tissue specimens, where it forms adducts with biomolecules, but this hinders the analysis of nucleic acids in the specimen. Bifunctional organocatalysts that speed the reversal of formaldehyde adducts of RNA and DNA are now reported, and show promise for general use in clinical specimens.

Title: 
Brightening of carbon nanotube photoluminescence through the incorporation of sp3 defects

Semiconducting carbon nanotubes promise a broad range of potential applications in optoelectronics and imaging, but their photon-conversion efficiency is relatively low. Quantum theory suggests that nanotube photoluminescence is intrinsically inefficient because of low-lying ‘dark’ exciton states. Here we demonstrate the significant brightening of nanotube photoluminescence (up to 28-fold) through the creation of an optically allowed defect state that resides below the predicted energy level of the dark excitons. Emission from this new state generates a photoluminescence peak that is red-shifted by as much as 254 meV from the nanotube's original excitonic transition. We also found that the attachment of electron-withdrawing substituents to carbon nanotubes systematically drives this defect state further down the energy ladder. Our experiments show that the material's photoluminescence quantum yield increases exponentially as a function of the shifted emission energy. This work lays the foundation for chemical control of defect quantum states in low-dimensional carbon materials. The controlled functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes has been shown to brighten their photoluminescence up to 28 times, which challenges our current understanding of how chemical defects affect low-dimensional carbon materials. This significantly improved photon conversion efficiency promises to advance a broad range of optoelectronic and imaging applications based on carbon nanotubes.

Probing the early stages of photoreception in photoactive yellow protein with ultrafast time-domain Raman spectroscopy

Unveiling the nuclear motions of photoreceptor proteins in action is a crucial goal in protein science in order to understand their elaborate mechanisms and how they achieve optimal selectivity and efficiency. Previous studies have provided detailed information on the structures of intermediates that appear during the later stages (&gt;ns) of such photoreception cycles, yet the initial events immediately after photoabsorption remain unclear because of experimental challenges in monitoring nuclear rearrangements on ultrafast timescales, including protein-specific low-frequency motions. Using time-domain Raman probing with sub-7-fs pulses, we obtain snapshot vibrational spectra of photoactive yellow protein and a mutant with high sensitivity, providing insights into the key responses that drive photoreception. Our data show a drastic intensity drop of the excited-state marker band at 135 cm−1 within a few hundred femtoseconds, suggesting a rapid weakening of the hydrogen bond that anchors the chromophore. We also track formation of the first ground-state intermediate over the first few picoseconds and fully characterize its vibrational structure, revealing a substantially-twisted cis conformation. Photoreceptors play an essential role in determining the fate of subsequent biological reactions, however, tracking their structural evolution on ultrafast timescales has been challenging. Now, photoactive yellow protein has been studied using time-domain Raman spectroscopy with sub-7-femtosecond pulses, revealing the ultrafast rearrangement of its hydrogen-bonding structure and also the structure of the first photocycle intermediate.

Title: 
Structure of a designed protein cage that self-assembles into a highly porous cube

Natural proteins can be versatile building blocks for multimeric, self-assembling structures. Yet, creating protein-based assemblies with specific geometries and chemical properties remains challenging. Highly porous materials represent particularly interesting targets for designed assembly. Here, we utilize a strategy of fusing two natural protein oligomers using a continuous alpha-helical linker to design a novel protein that self assembles into a 750 kDa, 225 Å diameter, cube-shaped cage with large openings into a 130 Å diameter inner cavity. A crystal structure of the cage showed atomic-level agreement with the designed model, while electron microscopy, native mass spectrometry and small angle X-ray scattering revealed alternative assembly forms in solution. These studies show that accurate design of large porous assemblies with specific shapes is feasible, while further specificity improvements will probably require limiting flexibility to select against alternative forms. These results provide a foundation for the design of advanced materials with applications in bionanotechnology, nanomedicine and material sciences. A protein has been engineered so that 24 identical copies self-assemble into a cube-shaped hollow cage 23 nm in diameter and containing a 130-Å-diameter inner cavity. This represents the largest and most porous structure of its type so far.

Title: 
Solvent-switchable continuous-breathing behaviour in a diamondoid metal–organic framework and its influence on CO2 versus CH4 selectivity

Understanding the behaviour of flexible metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)—porous crystalline materials that undergo a structural change upon exposure to an external stimulus—underpins their design as responsive materials for specific applications, such as gas separation, molecular sensing, catalysis and drug delivery. Reversible transformations of a MOF between open- and closed-pore forms—a behaviour known as ‘breathing’—typically occur through well-defined crystallographic transitions. By contrast, continuous breathing is rare, and detailed characterization has remained very limited. Here we report a continuous-breathing mechanism that was studied by single-crystal diffraction in a MOF with a diamondoid network, (Me2NH2)[In(ABDC)2] (ABDC, 2-aminobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate). Desolvation of the MOF in two different solvents leads to two polymorphic activated forms with very different pore openings, markedly different gas-adsorption capacities and different CO2 versus CH4 selectivities. Partial desolvation introduces a gating pressure associated with CO2 adsorption, which shows that the framework can also undergo a combination of stepped and continuous breathing. Breathing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are functional materials whose molecular-scale pores can reversibly open and close. In contrast to typical defined structural transitions, continuous breathing has now been observed for a diamondoid MOF. Removal of two different solvents leads to two desolvated MOF polymorphs with dramatically different porosities and gas uptake properties, including CO2/CH4 selectivities. Partial desolvation introduces pressure-gated CO2 adsorption.

Title: 
Electronic coherence lineshapes reveal hidden excitonic correlations in photosynthetic light harvesting

The effective absorption cross-section of a molecule (acceptor) can be greatly increased by associating it with a cluster of molecules that absorb light and transfer the excitation energy to the acceptor molecule. The basic mechanism of such light harvesting by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is well established, but recent experiments have revealed a new feature whereby excitation is coherently shared among donor and acceptor molecules during FRET. In the present study, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy was used to examine energy transfer at ambient temperature in a naturally occurring light-harvesting protein (PE545 of the marine cryptophyte alga Rhodomonas sp. strain CS24). Quantum beating was observed across a range of excitation frequencies. The shapes of those features in the two-dimensional spectra were examined. Through simulations, we show that two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy provides a probe of the adiabaticity of the free energy landscape underlying light harvesting. Quantum beating has been observed in photosynthetic systems, suggesting that energy-transfer processes in natural light harvesting could involve quantum effects. Now, extensive beating is found in the light-harvesting protein of a cryptophyte alga, and shown to be electronic. The implications of these observations on the free-energy surfaces and exciton delocalization were investigated.

Title: 
Submicrometre geometrically encoded fluorescent barcodes self-assembled from DNA

The identification and differentiation of a large number of distinct molecular species with high temporal and spatial resolution is a major challenge in biomedical science. Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool, but its multiplexing ability is limited by the number of spectrally distinguishable fluorophores. Here, we used (deoxy)ribonucleic acid (DNA)-origami technology to construct submicrometre nanorods that act as fluorescent barcodes. We demonstrate that spatial control over the positioning of fluorophores on the surface of a stiff DNA nanorod can produce 216 distinct barcodes that can be decoded unambiguously using epifluorescence or total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Barcodes with higher spatial information density were demonstrated via the construction of super-resolution barcodes with features spaced by ∼40&nbsp;nm. One species of the barcodes was used to tag yeast surface receptors, which suggests their potential applications as in situ imaging probes for diverse biomolecular and cellular entities in their native environments. Life-science research and biomedical diagnostics call for robust fluorescence barcodes of compact size and high multiplexing capability. Here DNA-origami technology was used to construct a new kind of geometrically encoded barcode with excellent structural stiffness. They hold promise for both in situ and ex situ imaging of diverse biologically relevant entities.

Title: 
Synthesis of a metallic mesoporous pyrochlore as a catalyst for lithium–O2 batteries

The lithium–O2 ‘semi-fuel’ cell based on the reversible reaction of Li and O2 to form Li2O2 can theoretically provide energy densities that exceed those of Li-ion cells by up to a factor of five. A key limitation that differentiates it from other lithium batteries is that it requires effective catalysts (or ‘promoters’) to enable oxygen reduction and evolution. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel metallic mesoporous oxide using surfactant templating that shows promising catalytic activity and results in a cathode with a high reversible capacity of 10,000&nbsp;mAh&nbsp;g−1 (∼1,000&nbsp;mAh&nbsp;g−1 with respect to the total electrode weight including the peroxide product). This oxide also has a lower charge potential for oxygen evolution from Li2O2 than pure carbon. The properties are explained by the high fraction of surface defect active sites in the metallic oxide, and its unique morphology and variable oxygen stoichiometry. This strategy for creating porous metallic oxides may pave the way to new cathode architectures for the Li–O2 cell. The lithium–O2 battery can theoretically provide energy densities that greatly exceed that of Li-ion, but it requires more efficient catalysts (or ‘promoters’) than carbon for oxygen reduction and evolution. Here, we report a tailor-made mesoporous metallic oxide that results in high reversible capacities and operates over many cycles.

Salinomycin kills cancer stem cells by sequestering iron in lysosomes

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a subset of cells within tumours that exhibit self-renewal properties and the capacity to seed tumours. CSCs are typically refractory to conventional treatments and have been associated to metastasis and relapse. Salinomycin operates as a selective agent against CSCs through mechanisms that remain elusive. Here, we provide evidence that a synthetic derivative of salinomycin, which we named ironomycin (AM5), exhibits a more potent and selective activity against breast CSCs in vitro and in vivo, by accumulating and sequestering iron in lysosomes. In response to the ensuing cytoplasmic depletion of iron, cells triggered the degradation of ferritin in lysosomes, leading to further iron loading in this organelle. Iron-mediated production of reactive oxygen species promoted lysosomal membrane permeabilization, activating a cell death pathway consistent with ferroptosis. These findings reveal the prevalence of iron homeostasis in breast CSCs, pointing towards iron and iron-mediated processes as potential targets against these cells. Cancer stem cells are typically refractory to conventional treatments. Now, an unprecedented mechanism has been discovered by which salinomycin and derivatives can sequester iron in lysosomes leading to cytoplasmic iron depletion and the subsequent production of reactive oxygen species that are lethal to the cell. This discovery of the importance of iron in cancer stem cell maintenance provides an opportunity for developing new therapeutics.

Title: 
Mechanism of O2 diffusion and reduction in FeFe hydrogenases

FeFe hydrogenases are the most efficient H2-producing enzymes. However, inactivation by O2 remains an obstacle that prevents them being used in many biotechnological devices. Here, we combine electrochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations to uncover the molecular mechanism of O2 diffusion within the enzyme and its reactions at the active site. We propose that the partial reversibility of the reaction with O2 results from the four-electron reduction of O2 to water. The third electron/proton transfer step is the bottleneck for water production, competing with formation of a highly reactive OH radical and hydroxylated cysteine. The rapid delivery of electrons and protons to the active site is therefore crucial to prevent the accumulation of these aggressive species during prolonged O2 exposure. These findings should provide important clues for the design of hydrogenase mutants with increased resistance to oxidative damage. FeFe hydrogenases are highly efficient H2 producing enzymes; however, they can be inactivated by O2. Now, a mechanism for O2 diffusion within FeFe hydrogenases and its reactions at the active site of the enzyme has been proposed. These findings could help with the design of hydrogenase mutants with increased resistance to oxidative damage.

Title: 
Low-energy spectrum of iron–sulfur clusters directly from many-particle quantum mechanics

Iron–sulfur clusters are a universal biological motif. They carry out electron transfer, redox chemistry and even oxygen sensing, in diverse processes including nitrogen fixation, respiration and photosynthesis. Their low-lying electronic states are key to their remarkable reactivity, but they cannot be directly observed. Here, we present the first ever quantum calculation of the electronic levels of [2Fe–2S] and [4Fe–4S] clusters free from any model assumptions. Our results highlight the limitations of long-standing models of their electronic structure. In particular, we demonstrate that the widely used Heisenberg double exchange model underestimates the number of states by one to two orders of magnitude, which can conclusively be traced to the absence of Fe d d excitations, thought to be important in these clusters. Furthermore, the electronic energy levels of even the same spin are dense on the scale of vibrational fluctuations and this provides a natural explanation for the ubiquity of these clusters in catalysis in nature. FeS clusters are a universal motif in organisms and are central to many processes, including nitrogen fixation and respiration. By carrying out the first many-electron calculation of the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, they are shown to have an unusual set of closely packed energy levels, which are key to understanding their reactivity.

Polyoxometalate electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant metals for efficient water oxidation in acidic media

Water splitting is a promising approach to the efficient and cost-effective production of renewable fuels, but water oxidation remains a bottleneck in its technological development because it largely relies on noble-metal catalysts. Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH &lt; 1, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm–2. In addition, we find that a carbon-paste conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment. Electrochemical water oxidation in acidic media is a promising water-splitting technique, but typically requires noble metal catalysts. Now, two polyoxometalate salts based on earth-abundant metals have shown excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. The barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperformed the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst at pHs lower than 1.

In situ real-time imaging of self-sorted supramolecular nanofibres

Self-sorted supramolecular nanofibres—a multicomponent system that consists of several types of fibre, each composed of distinct building units—play a crucial role in complex, well-organized systems with sophisticated functions, such as living cells. Designing and controlling self-sorting events in synthetic materials and understanding their structures and dynamics in detail are important elements in developing functional artificial systems. Here, we describe the in situ real-time imaging of self-sorted supramolecular nanofibre hydrogels consisting of a peptide gelator and an amphiphilic phosphate. The use of appropriate fluorescent probes enabled the visualization of self-sorted fibres entangled in two and three dimensions through confocal laser scanning microscopy and super-resolution imaging, with 80 nm resolution. In situ time-lapse imaging showed that the two types of fibre have different formation rates and that their respective physicochemical properties remain intact in the gel. Moreover, we directly visualized stochastic non-synchronous fibre formation and observed a cooperative mechanism. Designing self-sorting events, and understanding their dynamics, in synthetic supramolecular assembly is a promising route towards complex, functional artificial systems. The formation of self-sorted supramolecular nanofibres has now been imaged in situ, in real time, by confocal laser microscopy. A stochastic, non-synchronous fibre formation through a cooperative mechanism was observed.

An iron-catalysed C–C bond-forming spirocyclization cascade providing sustainable access to new 3D heterocyclic frameworks

Heterocyclic architectures offer powerful creative possibilities to a range of chemistry end-users. This is particularly true of heterocycles containing a high proportion of sp3-carbon atoms, which confer precise spatial definition upon chemical probes, drug substances, chiral monomers and the like. Nonetheless, simple catalytic routes to new heterocyclic cores are infrequently reported, and methods making use of biomass-accessible starting materials are also rare. Here, we demonstrate a new method allowing rapid entry to spirocyclic bis-heterocycles, in which inexpensive iron(III) catalysts mediate a highly stereoselective C–C bond-forming cyclization cascade reaction using (2-halo)aryl ethers and amines constructed using feedstock chemicals readily available from plant sources. Fe(acac)3 mediates the deiodinative cyclization of (2-halo)aryloxy furfuranyl ethers, followed by capture of the intermediate metal species by Grignard reagents, to deliver spirocycles containing two asymmetric centres. The reactions offer potential entry to key structural motifs present in bioactive natural products. The use of earth-abundant metals in catalysis is a prerequisite for the development of sustainable synthetic chemical processes for the future. Now, biomass-derived chemicals can be used in an efficient iron-catalysed reaction to make complex spirocycles. The resulting products contain two asymmetric centres that are furnished in high stereoselectivity.

A protein engineered to bind uranyl selectively and with femtomolar affinity

Uranyl (UO22+), the predominant aerobic form of uranium, is present in the ocean at a concentration of ~3.2 parts per 109 (13.7&nbsp;nM); however, the successful enrichment of uranyl from this vast resource has been limited by the high concentrations of metal ions of similar size and charge, which makes it difficult to design a binding motif that is selective for uranyl. Here we report the design and rational development of a uranyl-binding protein using a computational screening process in the initial search for potential uranyl-binding sites. The engineered protein is thermally stable and offers very high affinity and selectivity for uranyl with a Kd of 7.4 femtomolar (fM) and &gt;10,000-fold selectivity over other metal ions. We also demonstrated that the uranyl-binding protein can repeatedly sequester 30–60% of the uranyl in synthetic sea water. The chemical strategy employed here may be applied to engineer other selective metal-binding proteins for biotechnology and remediation applications. The extraction of uranium from seawater is limited by the high concentrations of carbonate and competing metal ions. Now, a highly selective uranyl-binding protein with femtomolar affinity has been developed. This protein can extract up to 60% uranium from synthetic seawater when immobilized on bacterial cell surfaces or amylose resin.

Mass-selected nanoparticles of PtxY as model catalysts for oxygen electroreduction

Low-temperature fuel cells are limited by the oxygen reduction reaction, and their widespread implementation in automotive vehicles is hindered by the cost of platinum, currently the best-known catalyst for reducing oxygen in terms of both activity and stability. One solution is to decrease the amount of platinum required, for example by alloying, but without detrimentally affecting its properties. The alloy PtxY is known to be active and stable, but its synthesis in nanoparticulate form has proved challenging, which limits its further study. Herein we demonstrate the synthesis, characterization and catalyst testing of model PtxY nanoparticles prepared through the gas-aggregation technique. The catalysts reported here are highly active, with a mass activity of up to 3.05 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. Using a variety of characterization techniques, we show that the enhanced activity of PtxY over elemental platinum results exclusively from a compressive strain exerted on the platinum surface atoms by the alloy core. The widespread use of fuel cells requires improved catalysts to reduce oxygen efficiently at the cathode. It is shown that model, well-characterized size-selected PtxY nanoparticles can be synthesized by the gas aggregation technique, and that they are highly active for this reaction.

The oxidative inactivation of FeFe hydrogenase reveals the flexibility of the H-cluster

Nature is a valuable source of inspiration in the design of catalysts, and various approaches are used to elucidate the mechanism of hydrogenases, the enzymes that oxidize or produce H2. In FeFe hydrogenases, H2 oxidation occurs at the H-cluster, and catalysis involves H2 binding on the vacant coordination site of an iron centre. Here, we show that the reversible oxidative inactivation of this enzyme results from the binding of H2 to coordination positions that are normally blocked by intrinsic CO ligands. This flexibility of the coordination sphere around the reactive iron centre confers on the enzyme the ability to avoid harmful reactions under oxidizing conditions, including exposure to O2. The versatile chemistry of the diiron cluster in the natural system might inspire the design of novel synthetic catalysts for H2 oxidation. FeFe hydrogenases, the enzymes that oxidize or produce H2, are inactivated under oxidizing conditions. Here, it is shown that this inactivation results from H2 binding to coordination positions that are normally blocked by intrinsic CO ligands. This flexibility of the active site prevents irreversible oxidative damage.

Single solvent molecules can affect the dynamics of substitution reactions

Solvents have a profound influence on chemical reactions in solution and have long been used to control their outcome. Such effects are generally considered to be governed by thermodynamics; however, little is known about the steric effects of solvent molecules. Here, we probe the influence of individual solvent molecules on reaction dynamics and present results on the atomistic dynamics of a microsolvated chemical reaction—the fundamentally important nucleophilic substitution reaction. We study the reaction of OH− with CH3I using a technique that combines crossed-beam imaging with a cold source of microsolvated reactants. Our results reveal several distinct reaction mechanisms for different degrees of solvation; surprisingly, the classical co-linear substitution mechanism only dominates the dynamics for mono-solvated reactants. We analyse the relative importance of the different mechanisms using ab initio calculations and show that the steric characteristics are at least as relevant as the energetics in understanding the influence of solvent molecules in such microsolvated reactions. How do solvent molecules influence the dynamics of a chemical reaction? Crossed-beam molecular imaging experiments reveal how different reaction mechanisms can be either suppressed or enhanced by the presence of one water molecule. The study finds that steric effects are responsible for the observed dynamics.

Co-assembly, spatiotemporal control and morphogenesis of a hybrid protein–peptide system

Controlling molecular interactions between bioinspired molecules can enable the development of new materials with higher complexity and innovative properties. Here we report on a dynamic system that emerges from the conformational modification of an elastin-like protein by peptide amphiphiles and with the capacity to access, and be maintained in, non-equilibrium for substantial periods of time. The system enables the formation of a robust membrane that displays controlled assembly and disassembly capabilities, adhesion and sealing to surfaces, self-healing and the capability to undergo morphogenesis into tubular structures with high spatiotemporal control. We use advanced microscopy along with turbidity and spectroscopic measurements to investigate the mechanism of assembly and its relation to the distinctive membrane architecture and the resulting dynamic properties. Using cell-culture experiments with endothelial and adipose-derived stem cells, we demonstrate the potential of this system to generate complex bioactive scaffolds for applications such as tissue engineering. Amphiphilic-peptide-driven opening of elastin-like protein molecules triggers the self-assembly of a multilayered membrane. This dynamic system can undergo morphogenesis into hierarchically ordered tubular structures that can be used to create complex scaffolds for tissue engineering.

Highly enantioselective trapping of zwitterionic intermediates by imines

Reactions with the unstable and highly reactive zwitterionic intermediates generated in processes catalysed by transition metals are providing new opportunities for molecular constructions. Insertion reactions involve the collapse of zwitterionic intermediates, but trapping them would allow structural elaborations that are not currently available. To synthesize complex molecules in this manner, reactive electrophiles can be used to trap the zwitterionic intermediates. Here, we describe the use of imines, activated by chiral organocatalysts, and a highly efficient integrated rhodium and chiral Brønsted acid co-catalysed process to trap zwitterionic intermediates that have been proposed previously to undergo a formal C–H insertion reaction, allowing us to obtain polyfunctionalized indole and oxindole derivatives in a single step with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. Reactions with unstable and highly reactive zwitterionic intermediates generated in transition-metal-catalysed processes provide new opportunities for molecular constructions. Here imines, activated by chiral organocatalysts, have been employed to trap the zwitterionic intermediates to give polyfunctionalized indole and oxindole derivatives in a single step with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity.

Determination of photoelectrochemical water oxidation intermediates on haematite electrode surfaces using operando infrared spectroscopy

Semiconductor electrodes capable of using solar photons to drive water-splitting reactions, such as haematite (α-Fe2O3), have been the subject of tremendous interest over recent decades. The surface has been found to play a significant role in determining the efficiency of water oxidation with haematite; however, previous works have only allowed hypotheses to be formulated regarding the identity of relevant surface species. Here we investigate the water-oxidation reaction on haematite using infrared spectroscopy under photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-oxidation conditions. A potential- and light-dependent absorption peak at 898 cm−1 is assigned to a FeIV=O group, which is an intermediate in the PEC water-oxidation reaction. These results provide direct evidence of high-valent iron–oxo intermediates as the product of the first hole-transfer reaction on the haematite surface and represent an important step in establishing the mechanism of PEC water oxidation on semiconductor electrodes. Photoelectrochemical water oxidation with haematite is known to be associated with a build-up of holes at the electrode surface. Infrared spectra acquired during photoelectrochemical water oxidation have now allowed these holes to be identified as high-valent iron–oxo intermediate species involved in the water oxidation reaction.

Enantioselective cyclizations and cyclization cascades of samarium ketyl radicals

The rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple starting materials is a key challenge in synthesis. Enantioselective radical cyclization cascades have the potential to deliver complex, densely packed, polycyclic architectures, with control of three-dimensional shape, in one step. Unfortunately, carrying out reactions with radicals in an enantiocontrolled fashion remains challenging due to their high reactivity. This is particularly the case for reactions of radicals generated using the classical reagent, SmI2. Here, we demonstrate that enantioselective SmI2-mediated radical cyclizations and cascades that exploit a simple, recyclable chiral ligand can convert symmetrical ketoesters to complex carbocyclic products bearing multiple stereocentres with high enantio- and diastereocontrol. A computational study has been used to probe the origin of the enantioselectivity. Our studies suggest that many processes that rely on SmI2 can be rendered enantioselective by the design of suitable ligands. Although samarium-mediated cyclizations have the potential to generate significant molecular complexity, historically it has not proven possible to exert enantiocontrol through the use of a chiral ligand in complex product synthesis. Now, an enantioselective SmI2-mediated radical cyclization has been developed using a chiral aminodiol ligand. Desymmetrizing 5-exo ketyl-alkene cyclizations and cyclization cascades of unsaturated ketoesters deliver complex products and typically proceed with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

Phase-transfer-catalysed asymmetric synthesis of tetrasubstituted allenes

Allenes are molecules based on three carbons connected by two cumulated carbon–carbon double bonds. Given their axially chiral nature and unique reactivity, substituted allenes have a variety of applications in organic chemistry as key synthetic intermediates and directly as part of biologically active compounds. Although the demands for these motivated many endeavours to make axially chiral, substituted allenes by exercising asymmetric catalysis, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of fully substituted ones (tetrasubstituted allenes) remained largely an unsolved issue. The fundamental obstacle to solving this conundrum is the lack of a simple synthetic transformation that provides tetrasubstituted allenes in the action of catalysis. We report herein a strategy to overcome this issue by the use of a phase-transfer-catalysed asymmetric functionalization of 1-alkylallene-1,3-dicarboxylates with N-arylsulfonyl imines and benzylic and allylic bromides. Substituted allenes with axial chirality are of great utility in organic chemistry owing to their unique structure and reactivity, but synthetic methods to access them are limited. Here, a catalytic asymmetric synthesis of tetrasubstituted allenes is described that builds on the use of phase-transfer-catalysed asymmetric functionalization of 1-alkylallene-1,3-dicarboxylates.

Ballbot-type motion of N-heterocyclic carbenes on gold surfaces

Recently, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were introduced as alternative anchors for surface modifications and so offered many attractive features, which might render them superior to thiol-based systems. However, little effort has been made to investigate the self-organization process of NHCs on surfaces, an important aspect for the formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), which requires molecular mobility. Based on investigations with scanning tunnelling microscopy and first-principles calculations, we provide an understanding of the microscopic mechanism behind the high mobility observed for NHCs. These NHCs extract a gold atom from the surface, which leads to the formation of an NHC–gold adatom complex that displays a high surface mobility by a ballbot-type motion. Together with their high desorption barrier this enables the formation of ordered and strongly bound SAMs. In addition, this mechanism allows a complementary surface-assisted synthesis of dimeric and hitherto unknown trimeric NHC gold complexes on the surface. STM investigations and first principles calculations provide an understanding of the microscopic mechanism behind the mobility of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on gold surfaces. Now, it is shown that a ballbot-type motion allows the formation of self-assembled monolayers due to the NHC extracting a gold atom from the surface, leading to a ligated gold adatom.

A family of zeolites with controlled pore size prepared using a top-down method

The properties of zeolites, and thus their suitability for different applications, are intimately connected with their structures. Synthesizing specific architectures is therefore important, but has remained challenging. Here we report a top-down strategy that involves the disassembly of a parent zeolite, UTL, and its reassembly into two zeolites with targeted topologies, IPC-2 and IPC-4. The three zeolites are closely related as they adopt the same layered structure, and they differ only in how the layers are connected. Choosing different linkers gives rise to different pore sizes, enabling the synthesis of materials with predetermined pore architectures. The structures of the resulting zeolites were characterized by interpreting the X-ray powder-diffraction patterns through models using computational methods; IPC-2 exhibits orthogonal 12- and ten-ring channels, and IPC-4 is a more complex zeolite that comprises orthogonal ten- and eight-ring channels. We describe how this method enables the preparation of functional materials and discuss its potential for targeting other new zeolites. The disassembly of a parent zeolite and its reassembly into two zeolites with targeted topologies is described. This process demonstrates that it is possible to target specific ring sizes in a zeolite by replacing one size of unit in the structure with alternative units of a different size.

Quantum dynamical resonances in low-energy CO(j = 0) + He inelastic collisions

In molecular collisions, long-lived complexes may be formed that correspond to quasi-bound states in the van der Waals potential and give rise to peaks in the collision energy-dependent cross-sections. They are known as ‘resonances’ and their experimental detection remains difficult because their signatures are extremely challenging to resolve. Here, we show a complete characterization of quantum-dynamical resonances occurring in CO–He inelastic collisions with rotational CO(j = 0   1) excitation. Crossed-beam scattering experiments were performed at collision energies as low as 4 cm−1, equivalent to a temperature of 4 K. Resonance structures in the measured cross-sections were identified by comparison with quantum-mechanical calculations. The excellent agreement found confirms that the potential energy surfaces describing the CO–He van der Waals interaction are perfectly suitable for calculating state-to-state (de)excitation rate coefficients at the very low temperatures needed in chemical modelling of the interstellar medium. We also computed these rate coefficients. Long-lived molecular collision complexes — or ‘resonances’ — are difficult to identify experimentally. Now crossed-beam experiments and quantum calculations are reported for rotationally inelastic CO−He collisions at energies corresponding to temperatures as low as 4 K. Quantum dynamical resonances that are predicted by theory were detected and fully characterized.

Detecting the oxyl radical of photocatalytic water oxidation at an n-SrTiO3/aqueous interface through its subsurface vibration

Although the water oxidation cycle involves the critical step of O–O bond formation, the transition metal oxide radical thought to be the catalytic intermediate for this step has eluded direct observation. The radical represents the transformation of charge into a nascent catalytic intermediate, which lacks a newly formed bond and is therefore inherently difficult to detect. Here, using theoretical calculations and ultrafast in situ infrared spectroscopy of photocatalysis at an n-SrTiO3/aqueous interface, we reveal a subsurface vibration of the oxygen directly below, and uniquely generated by, the oxyl radical (Ti–O•). Intriguingly, this interfacial Ti–O stretch vibration, once decoupled from the lattice, couples to reactant dynamics (water librations). These experiments demonstrate subsurface vibrations and their coupling to solvent and electron dynamics to detect nascent catalytic intermediates at the solid–liquid interface at the molecular level. One can envision using the subsurface vibrations and their coupling across the interface to track and control catalysis dynamically. Water oxidation on titanate surfaces is thought to occur via an oxyl-radical intermediate (Ti­–O•), which precedes O–O bond formation, and for which there is indirect evidence. Using ultrafast infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations of photocatalytic water oxidation at the n-SrTiO3/aqueous interface, the oxyl radical has now been detected through its subsurface vibration.

An electrochemical clamp assay for direct, rapid analysis of circulating nucleic acids in serum

The analysis of cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs), which are present at significant levels in the blood of cancer patients, can reveal the mutational spectrum of a tumour without the need for invasive sampling of the tissue. However, this requires differentiation between the nucleic acids that originate from healthy cells and the mutated sequences shed by tumour cells. Here we report an electrochemical clamp assay that directly detects mutated sequences in patient serum. This is the first successful detection of cfNAs without the need for enzymatic amplification, a step that normally requires extensive sample processing and is prone to interference. The new chip-based assay reads out the presence of mutations within 15 minutes using a collection of oligonucleotides that sequester closely related sequences in solution, and thus allow only the mutated sequence to bind to a chip-based sensor. We demonstrate excellent levels of sensitivity and specificity and show that the clamp assay accurately detects mutated sequences in a collection of samples taken from lung cancer and melanoma patients. The analysis of circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNA) in the blood of cancer patients permits the analysis of tumour mutations without requiring invasive sampling of tissue. Now, the development of an electrochemical assay that uses a collection of clamp molecules to sequester interfering cfNAs enables the accurate detection of mutated sequences in serum collected from people with lung cancer or melanoma.

The role of metal ions in X-ray-induced photochemistry

Metal centres in biomolecules are recognized as being particularly sensitive to radiation damage by X-ray photons. This results in such molecules being both susceptible to an effective X-ray-induced loss of function and problematic to study using X-ray diffraction methods, with reliable structures of the metal centres difficult to obtain. Despite the abundance of experimental evidence, the mechanistic details of radiation damage at metal centres are unclear. Here, using ab initio calculations, we show that the absorption of X-rays by microsolvated Mg2+ results in a complicated chain of ultrafast electronic relaxation steps that comprise both intra- and intermolecular processes and last for a few hundred femtoseconds. At the end of this cascade the metal reverts to its original charge state, the immediate environment becomes multiply ionized and large concentrations of radicals and slow electrons build up in the metal's vicinity. We conclude that such cascades involving metal ions are essential to our understanding of radiation chemistry and radiation damage in biological environments. Metal centres play an important role in the damage to biomolecules caused by radiation, but the respective microscopic mechanisms are unknown. Now it is shown that the absorption of X-rays by a metal ion leads to an intricate chain of ultrafast relaxation steps that results in the complete degradation of the metal's local environment.

Engaging unactivated alkyl, alkenyl and aryl iodides in visible-light-mediated free radical reactions

Radical reactions are a powerful class of chemical transformations. However, the formation of radical species to initiate these reactions has often required the use of stoichiometric amounts of toxic reagents, such as tributyltin hydride. Recently, the use of visible-light-mediated photoredox catalysis to generate radical species has become popular, but the scope of these radical precursors has been limited. Here, we describe the identification of reaction conditions under which photocatalysts such as fac-Ir(ppy)3 can be utilized to form radicals from unactivated alkyl, alkenyl and aryl iodides. The generated radicals undergo reduction via hydrogen atom abstraction or reductive cyclization. The reaction protocol utilizes only inexpensive reagents, occurs under mild reaction conditions, and shows exceptional functional group tolerance. Reaction efficiency is maintained upon scale-up and decreased catalyst loading, and the reaction time can be significantly shortened when the reaction is performed in a flow reactor. Visible-light-mediated photocatalytic generation of carbon-centred radicals from alkyl, alkenyl and aryl iodides, which then undergo subsequent hydrogen-atom abstraction or reductive cyclizations, is reported. The protocol is characterized by the use of inexpensive reagents, mild conditions, exceptional functional group tolerance, and good to high yields.

Title: 
Thermally bisignate supramolecular polymerization

One of the enticing characteristics of supramolecular polymers is their thermodynamic reversibility, which is attractive, in particular, for stimuli-responsive applications. These polymers usually disassemble upon heating, but here we report a supramolecular polymerization that occurs upon heating as well as cooling. This behaviour arises from the use of a metalloporphyrin-based tailored monomer bearing eight amide-containing side chains, which assembles into a highly thermostable one-dimensional polymer through π-stacking and multivalent hydrogen-bonding interactions, and a scavenger, 1-hexanol, in a dodecane-based solvent. At around 50 °C, the scavenger locks the monomer into a non-polymerizable form through competing hydrogen bonding. On cooling, the scavenger preferentially self-aggregates, unlocking the monomer for polymerization. Heating also results in unlocking the monomer for polymerization, by disrupting the dipole and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the scavenger. Analogous to ‘upper and lower critical solution temperature phenomena’ for covalently bonded polymers, such a thermally bisignate feature may lead to supramolecular polymers with tailored complex thermoresponsive properties. An attractive feature of supramolecular polymers is their reversibility — they typically depolymerize upon heating. Now, in the presence of a scavenger molecule, a metalloporphyrin derivative bearing eight amide-containing side chains has been shown to undergo supramolecular polymerization on heating as well as cooling through π-stacking and multivalent hydrogen-bonding interactions.

Dynamic multi-component covalent assembly for the reversible binding of secondary alcohols and chirality sensing

Reversible covalent bonding is often used for the creation of novel supramolecular structures, multi-component assemblies and sensing ensembles. Despite the remarkable success of dynamic covalent systems, the reversible binding of a mono-alcohol with high strength is challenging. Here, we show that a strategy of carbonyl activation and hemiaminal ether stabilization can be embodied in a four-component reversible assembly that creates a tetradentate ligand and incorporates secondary alcohols with exceptionally high affinity. Evidence is presented that the intermediate leading to binding and exchange of alcohols is an iminium ion. To demonstrate the use of this assembly process we also explored chirality sensing and enantiomeric excess determinations. An induced twist in the ligand by a chiral mono-ol results in large Cotton effects in the circular dichroism spectra indicative of the handedness of the alcohol. The strategy revealed in this study should prove broadly applicable for the incorporation of alcohols into supramolecular architecture construction. The reversible covalent binding of mono-alcohols with high affinity is challenging because of their poor nucleophilicity. A multi-component assembly has now been used to achieve reversible binding of secondary alcohols through iminium activation and product stabilization. Moreover, such assemblies can be used to determine alcohol chirality and enantiomeric excess.

Self-assembly of nanoparticles into biomimetic capsid-like nanoshells

Nanoscale compartments are one of the foundational elements of living systems. Capsids, carboxysomes, exosomes, vacuoles and other nanoshells easily self-assemble from biomolecules such as lipids or proteins, but not from inorganic nanomaterials because of difficulties with the replication of spherical tiling. Here we show that stabilizer-free polydispersed inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) can spontaneously organize into porous nanoshells. The association of water-soluble CdS NPs into self-limited spherical capsules is the result of scale-modified electrostatic, dispersion and other colloidal forces. They cannot be accurately described by the Derjaguin–Landau–Vervey–Overbeek theory, whereas molecular-dynamics simulations with combined atomistic and coarse-grained description of NPs reveal the emergence of nanoshells and some of their stabilization mechanisms. Morphology of the simulated assemblies formed under different conditions matched nearly perfectly the transmission electron microscopy tomography data. This study bridges the gap between biological and inorganic self-assembling nanosystems and conceptualizes a new pathway to spontaneous compartmentalization for a wide range of inorganic NPs including those existing on prebiotic Earth. Biomolecular nanoscale compartments are ubiquitous in living systems. Although their formation is fairly straightforward, the same cannot be said of their inorganic counterparts. In this study, uniform nanoshells are observed self-assembling from stabilizer-free inorganic nanoparticles in water, under ambient conditions, and without the need for spherical tiling. This enables further study of inorganic prebiotic systems and compartmentalized biomimetic catalysis.

Title: 
Synthesis of most polyene natural product motifs using just 12 building blocks and one coupling reaction

The inherent modularity of polypeptides, oligonucleotides and oligosaccharides has been harnessed to achieve generalized synthesis platforms. Importantly, like these other targets, most small-molecule natural products are biosynthesized via iterative coupling of bifunctional building blocks. This suggests that many small molecules also possess inherent modularity commensurate with systematic building block-based construction. Supporting this hypothesis, here we report that the polyene motifs found in &gt;75% of all known polyene natural products can be synthesized using just 12 building blocks and one coupling reaction. Using the same general retrosynthetic algorithm and reaction conditions, this platform enabled both the synthesis of a wide range of polyene frameworks that covered all of this natural-product chemical space and the first total syntheses of the polyene natural products asnipyrone B, physarigin A and neurosporaxanthin β-D-glucopyranoside. Collectively, these results suggest the potential for a more generalized approach to making small molecules in the laboratory. Polyene motifs are found in a large number of natural products. Now, by applying a general retrosynthetic algorithm, it has been shown that the polyene motifs found in &gt;75% of these compounds can be synthesized using just 12 bifunctional haloalkenyl MIDA boronate building blocks and one coupling reaction.

Title: 
Concerted proton-coupled electron transfer from a metal-hydride complex

Metal hydrides are key intermediates in the catalytic reduction of protons and CO2 as well as in the oxidation of H2. In these reactions, electrons and protons are transferred to or from separate acceptors or donors in bidirectional proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps. The mechanistic interpretation of PCET reactions of metal hydrides has focused on the stepwise transfer of electrons and protons. A concerted transfer may, however, occur with a lower reaction barrier and therefore proceed at higher catalytic rates. Here we investigate the feasibility of such a reaction by studying the oxidation–deprotonation reactions of a tungsten hydride complex. The rate dependence on the driving force for both electron transfer and proton transfer—employing different combinations of oxidants and bases—was used to establish experimentally the concerted, bidirectional PCET of a metal-hydride species. Consideration of the findings presented here in future catalyst designs may lead to more-efficient catalysts. Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) of metal hydrides, in which electrons and protons go to or from different molecular sites, are key steps in catalytic reactions involving solar fuels. Using [(Cp)W(CO)3H] as a model compound, it is now shown that this PCET reaction can occur in a concerted fashion, suggesting a possible low-barrier pathway to catalysis.

The hydrodeoxygenation of bioderived furans into alkanes

The conversion of biomass into fuels and chemical feedstocks is one part of a drive to reduce the world's dependence on crude oil. For transportation fuels in particular, wholesale replacement of a fuel is logistically problematic, not least because of the infrastructure that is already in place. Here, we describe the catalytic defunctionalization of a series of biomass-derived molecules to provide linear alkanes suitable for use as transportation fuels. These biomass-derived molecules contain a variety of functional groups, including olefins, furan rings and carbonyl groups. We describe the removal of these in either a stepwise process or a one-pot process using common reagents and catalysts under mild reaction conditions to provide n-alkanes in good yields and with high selectivities. Our general synthetic approach is applicable to a range of precursors with different carbon content (chain length). This allows the selective generation of linear alkanes with carbon chain lengths between eight and sixteen carbons. The development of methodology to convert biomass into fuels and chemical feedstocks is part of a drive to reduce the world's dependence on crude oil. Here, the catalytic defunctionalization of a series of biomass-derived molecules is described, which allows the selective generation of alkanes with carbon chain lengths between eight and sixteen for use as transportation fuels.

Modular synthesis of N-glycans and arrays for the hetero-ligand binding analysis of HIV antibodies

A new class of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) from HIV donors has been reported to target the glycans on gp120—a glycoprotein found on the surface of the virus envelope—thus renewing hope of developing carbohydrate-based HIV vaccines. However, the version of gp120 used in previous studies was not from human T cells and so the glycosylation pattern could be somewhat different to that found in the native system. Moreover, some antibodies recognized two different glycans simultaneously and this cannot be detected with the commonly used glycan microarrays on glass slides. Here, we have developed a glycan microarray on an aluminium-oxide-coated glass slide containing a diverse set of glycans, including homo- and mixed N-glycans (high-mannose, hybrid and complex types) that were prepared by modular chemo-enzymatic methods to detect the presence of hetero-glycan binding behaviours. This new approach allows rapid screening and identification of optimal glycans recognized by neutralizing antibodies, and could speed up the development of HIV-1 vaccines targeting cell surface glycans. The glycoprotein gp120 is found on the surface of the HIV viron; it is essential for virus entry into cells. Now, an efficient modular synthesis of N-glycans and the preparation of a mixed-glycan array on aluminium-oxide-coated glass slide is described. This is a vital step in understanding the complex compositions of gp120 and thus important for the development of new HIV therapies.

Title: 
Building an appropriate active-site motif into a hydrogen-evolution catalyst with thiomolybdate [Mo3S13]2− clusters

Identifying and understanding the active sites responsible for reaction turnover is critical to developing improved catalysts. For the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER), MoS2 has been identified as an active non-noble-metal-based catalyst. However, only edge sites turnover the reaction because the basal planes are catalytically inert. In an effort to develop a scalable HER catalyst with an increased number of active sites, herein we report a Mo–S catalyst (supported thiomolybdate [Mo3S13]2− nanoclusters) in which most sulfur atoms in the structure exhibit a structural motif similar to that observed at MoS2 edges. Supported sub-monolayers of [Mo3S13]2− nanoclusters exhibited excellent HER activity and stability in acid. Imaging at the atomic scale with scanning tunnelling microscopy allowed for direct characterization of these supported catalysts. The [Mo3S13]2− nanoclusters reported herein demonstrated excellent turnover frequencies, higher than those observed for other non-precious metal catalysts synthesized by a scalable route. Non-noble-metal-based MoS2 nanostructures are hydrogen evolution catalysts whose active sites are known to be located at the edges. Supported thiomolybdate [Mo3S13]2− nanoclusters have now been prepared that exhibit a structural motif similar to that of MoS2 edges. The nanoclusters, synthesized by a scalable route, demonstrate a high turnover frequency.

Quadruple bonding in C2 and analogous eight-valence electron species

Triple bonding is conventionally considered to be the limit for multiply bonded main group elements, despite higher metal–metal bond orders being frequently observed for transition metals and lanthanides/actinides. Here, using high-level theoretical methods, we show that C2 and its isoelectronic molecules CN+, BN and CB− (each having eight valence electrons) are bound by a quadruple bond. The bonding comprises not only one σ- and two π-bonds, but also one weak ‘inverted’ bond, which can be characterized by the interaction of electrons in two outwardly pointing sp hybrid orbitals. A simple way of assessing the energy of the fourth bond is proposed and is found to be ~12–17&nbsp;kcal&nbsp;mol−1 for the isoelectronic species studied, and thus stronger than a hydrogen bond. In contrast, the analogues of C2 that contain higher-row elements, such as Si2 and Ge2, exhibit only double bonding. The bonding order of multiply bonded main-group elements is conventionally thought to be limited to triple bonds. Now, using high-level theoretical methods, it is shown that C2 and its isoelectronic molecules CN+, BN and CB− are quadruply bonded, featuring not only one σ - and two π-bonds, but also one weak ‘inverted’ bond.

Mechanistic, crystallographic, and computational studies on the catalytic, enantioselective sulfenofunctionalization of alkenes

The stereocontrolled introduction of vicinal heteroatomic substituents into organic molecules is one of the most powerful ways of adding value and function. Although many methods exist for the introduction of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing substituents, the number of stereocontrolled methods for the introduction of sulfur-containing substituents pales by comparison. Previous reports from our laboratories have described sulfenofunctionalizations of alkenes that construct carbon–sulfur bonds vicinal to carbon–oxygen, carbon–nitrogen or carbon–carbon bonds with high levels of diastereospecificity and enantioselectivity. This process is enabled by the concept of Lewis-base activation of Lewis acids, which provides activation of Group 16 electrophiles. To provide a foundation for the expansion of substrate scope and improved selectivities, we have undertaken a comprehensive study of the catalytically active species. Insights gleaned from kinetic, crystallographic and computational methods have led to the introduction of a new family of sulfenylating agents that provide significantly enhanced selectivities. Kinetic, X-ray crystallographic and computational studies have enabled the formulation of a comprehensive mechanistic picture of the enantioselective sulfenofunctionalization reaction of alkenes and a stereochemical model for the origin of the enantioselectivity. The experiments resulted in the development of 2,6-dialkylaryl sulfenylating agents, improving the enantioselectivity of the reaction to &gt;99:1 for γ-alkenols.

Self-assembly of polyhedral metal–organic framework particles into three-dimensional ordered superstructures

Self-assembly of particles into long-range, three-dimensional, ordered superstructures is crucial for the design of a variety of materials, including plasmonic sensing materials, energy or gas storage systems, catalysts and photonic crystals. Here, we have combined experimental and simulation data to show that truncated rhombic dodecahedral particles of the metal–organic framework (MOF) ZIF-8 can self-assemble into millimetre-sized superstructures with an underlying three-dimensional rhombohedral lattice that behave as photonic crystals. Those superstructures feature a photonic bandgap that can be tuned by controlling the size of the ZIF-8 particles and is also responsive to the adsorption of guest substances in the micropores of the ZIF-8 particles. In addition, superstructures with different lattices can also be assembled by tuning the truncation of ZIF-8 particles, or by using octahedral UiO-66 MOF particles instead. These well-ordered, sub-micrometre-sized superstructures might ultimately facilitate the design of three-dimensional photonic materials for applications in sensing. Colloidal particles of metal–organic frameworks (ZIF-8 and UiO-66) with different polyhedral shapes can self-assemble into well-ordered, porous three-dimensional superstructures. These superstructures function as photonic crystals, with a photonic band gap that depends on the size of the MOF particles and shifts upon the sorption of guests within their pores.

β-Carbon activation of saturated carboxylic esters through N-heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis

The activation of the α-carbons of carboxylic esters and related carbonyl compounds to generate enolate equivalents as nucleophiles is one of the most powerful strategies in organic synthesis. We reasoned that the horizons of chemical synthesis could be greatly expanded if the typically inert β-carbons of saturated esters could be used as nucleophiles. However, despite the rather significant fundamental and practical values, direct use of the β-carbons of saturated carbonyl compounds as nucleophiles remains elusive. Here we report the catalytic activation of simple saturated ester β-carbons as nucleophiles (β-carbon activation) using N-heterocyclic carbene organocatalysts. The catalytically generated nucleophilic β-carbons undergo enantioselective reactions with electrophiles such as enones and imines. Given the proven rich chemistry of ester α-carbons, we expect this catalytic activation mode for saturated ester β-carbons to open a valuable new arena for new and useful reactions and synthetic strategies. Direct β-carbon activation of saturated carbonyl compounds represents a significant fundamental challenge in organic chemistry. Here, the catalytic activation of saturated ester β-sp3 carbon as nucleophile via N-heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis is reported. The catalytically generated nucleophilic β-carbon undergoes enantioselective reactions with various electrophiles.

Inhibition of human copper trafficking by a small molecule significantly attenuates cancer cell proliferation

Copper is a transition metal that plays critical roles in many life processes. Controlling the cellular concentration and trafficking of copper offers a route to disrupt these processes. Here we report small molecules that inhibit the human copper-trafficking proteins Atox1 and CCS, and so provide a selective approach to disrupt cellular copper transport. The knockdown of Atox1 and CCS or their inhibition leads to a significantly reduced proliferation of cancer cells, but not of normal cells, as well as to attenuated tumour growth in mouse models. We show that blocking copper trafficking induces cellular oxidative stress and reduces levels of cellular ATP. The reduced level of ATP results in activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase that leads to reduced lipogenesis. Both effects contribute to the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Our results establish copper chaperones as new targets for future developments in anticancer therapies. Copper is a transition metal ion essential for the regulation of cellular oxidative stress and ATP production. Now, the inhibition of copper-trafficking proteins by a small molecule has been shown to significantly reduce proliferation of cancer cells. The results indicate that copper-trafficking proteins could represent new anti-tumour therapeutic targets.

Biogenetically inspired synthesis and skeletal diversification of indole alkaloids

To access architecturally complex natural products, chemists usually devise a customized synthetic strategy for constructing a single target skeleton. In contrast, biosynthetic assembly lines often employ divergent intramolecular cyclizations of a polyunsaturated common intermediate to produce diverse arrays of scaffolds. With the aim of integrating such biogenetic strategies, we show the development of an artificial divergent assembly line generating unprecedented numbers of scaffold variations of terpenoid indole alkaloids. This approach not only allows practical access to multipotent intermediates, but also enables systematic diversification of skeletal, stereochemical and functional group properties without structural simplification of naturally occurring alkaloids. Three distinct modes of [4+2] cyclizations and two types of redox-mediated annulations provided divergent access to five skeletally distinct scaffolds involving iboga-, aspidosperma-, andranginine- and ngouniensine-type skeletons and a non-natural variant within six to nine steps from tryptamine. The efficiency of our approach was demonstrated by successful total syntheses of (±)-vincadifformine, (±)-andranginine and (−)-catharanthine. Emulating the biogenesis of natural products, a synthetic strategy is described in which an achiral multipotent intermediate reacts through three distinct [4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2] cyclizations and two types of redox-mediated annulation. This results in divergent access to natural product-like scaffolds in 6–9 steps. The efficiency of this approach is highlighted in the total syntheses of three natural products.

Elucidation of the timescales and origins of quantum electronic coherence in LHCII

Photosynthetic organisms harvest sunlight with near unity quantum efficiency. The complexity of the electronic structure and energy transfer pathways within networks of photosynthetic pigment–protein complexes often obscures the mechanisms behind the efficient light-absorption-to-charge conversion process. Recent experiments, particularly using two-dimensional spectroscopy, have detected long-lived quantum coherence, which theory suggests may contribute to the effectiveness of photosynthetic energy transfer. Here, we present a new, direct method to access coherence signals: a coherence-specific polarization sequence, which isolates the excitonic coherence features from the population signals that usually dominate two-dimensional spectra. With this polarization sequence, we elucidate coherent dynamics and determine the overall measurable lifetime of excitonic coherence in the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II. Coherence decays on two distinct timescales of 47&nbsp;fs and ~800&nbsp;fs. We present theoretical calculations to show that these two timescales are from weakly and moderately strongly coupled pigments, respectively. Quantum coherence has been observed in the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII) from green plants. By controlling the laser pulse polarization in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, signals from quantum coherence have been separated from other molecular processes, offering insight into the role of quantum coherence in photosynthetic light-harvesting.

Dearomative dihydroxylation with arenophiles

Aromatic hydrocarbons are some of the most elementary feedstock chemicals, produced annually on a million metric ton scale, and are used in the production of polymers, paints, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Dearomatization reactions convert simple, readily available arenes into more complex molecules with broader potential utility, however, despite substantial progress and achievements in this field, there are relatively few methods for the dearomatization of simple arenes that also selectively introduce functionality. Here we describe a new dearomatization process that involves visible-light activation of small heteroatom-containing organic molecules—arenophiles—that results in their para-cycloaddition with a variety of aromatic compounds. The approach uses N–N-arenophiles to enable dearomative dihydroxylation and diaminodihydroxylation of simple arenes. This strategy provides direct and selective access to highly functionalized cyclohexenes and cyclohexadienes and is orthogonal to existing chemical and biological dearomatization processes. Finally, we demonstrate the synthetic utility of this strategy with the concise synthesis of several biologically active compounds and natural products. Dearomatization reactions that can simultaneously introduce functionality are valuable transformations that are largely underdeveloped. Now, a synthetic strategy based on the combination of arenophiles with catalytic dihydroxylation reactions enables rapid and controlled access to synthetically useful cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene derivatives from readily available arene starting materials.

A synthetic ion transporter that disrupts autophagy and induces apoptosis by perturbing cellular chloride concentrations

Perturbations in cellular chloride concentrations can affect cellular pH and autophagy and lead to the onset of apoptosis. With this in mind, synthetic ion transporters have been used to disturb cellular ion homeostasis and thereby induce cell death; however, it is not clear whether synthetic ion transporters can also be used to disrupt autophagy. Here, we show that squaramide-based ion transporters enhance the transport of chloride anions in liposomal models and promote sodium chloride influx into the cytosol. Liposomal and cellular transport activity of the squaramides is shown to correlate with cell death activity, which is attributed to caspase-dependent apoptosis. One ion transporter was also shown to cause additional changes in lysosomal pH, which leads to impairment of lysosomal enzyme activity and disruption of autophagic processes. This disruption is independent of the initiation of apoptosis by the ion transporter. This study provides the first experimental evidence that synthetic ion transporters can disrupt both autophagy and induce apoptosis. A squaramide-based anion transporter has now been shown to cause changes in the lysosomal pH leading to impairment of lysosomal enzyme activity and disruption of autophagic processes. The study provides the first experimental evidence that synthetic ion transporters can both disrupt autophagy and induce apoptosis.

Computer-aided molecular design of solvents for accelerated reaction kinetics

Solvents can significantly alter the rates and selectivity of liquid-phase organic reactions, often hindering the development of new synthetic routes or, if chosen wisely, facilitating routes by improving rates and selectivities. To address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%. Finding the right solvent can radically transform the rate of a reaction. Here, a systematic computational method for the identification of solvents that accelerate kinetics is described. Starting with a quantum mechanical computation of the reaction rate constant in a set of six solvents, a computer-aided approach identifies the best solvent among 1,341, with a 40% increase in reaction rate.

Chiral self-sorting and amplification in isotropic liquids of achiral molecules

According to our present knowledge, the spontaneous resolution of racemic mixtures of chiral molecules or chiral conformers of achiral molecules into macroscopic chiral superstructures requires the confinement of these molecules in a crystal lattice, on surfaces or in other well-ordered assemblies. Herein we provide the first experimental evidence that mirror-symmetry breaking can also take place at a liquid–liquid phase transition in isotropic liquids of achiral molecules, even at relatively high temperatures around 200 °C. It is proposed that cooperative segregation of enantiomorphic molecular conformations gives rise to a conglomerate of two chiral and immiscible liquids. In these liquid conglomerates a strong chiral amplification was observed, which led to degeneracy from a stochastic distribution and eventually provided uniform chirality. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the understanding of symmetry breaking in soft matter and provide a new tool for the identification of chirality traces, and possibly affect the discussion of the emergence of chirality in prebiotic systems. The spontaneous resolution of racemic mixtures can occur when the molecules are confined in a crystal lattice, on surfaces or in other well-ordered assemblies. Now, mirror symmetry breaking within an isotropic liquid of achiral molecules has been observed. These liquids show strong chiral amplification and provide a possible mode of emergence of chirality in prebiotic fluids.

Chlorodifluoromethane-triggered formation of difluoromethylated arenes catalysed by palladium

Difluoromethylated aromatic compounds are of increasing importance in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H), an inexpensive, abundant and widely used industrial raw material, represents the ideal and most straightforward difluoromethylating reagent, but introduction of the difluoromethyl group (CF2H) from ClCF2H into aromatics has not been reported. Here, we describe a direct palladium-catalysed difluoromethylation method for coupling ClCF2H with arylboronic acids and esters to generate difluoromethylated arenes with high efficiency. The reaction exhibits a remarkably broad substrate scope, including heteroarylboronic acids, and was used for difluoromethylation of a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that a palladium difluorocarbene intermediate is involved in the reaction. Although numerous metal–difluorocarbene complexes have been prepared, the catalytic synthesis of difluoromethylated or difluoromethylenated compounds involving metal–difluorocarbene complexes has not received much attention. This new reaction therefore also opens the door to understand metal–difluorocarbene complex catalysed reactions. Chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H), an inexpensive and abundant industrial raw material, represents an ideal and straightforward reagent for introducing the difluoromethyl group. However, efficient approaches for activation of the typically inert ClCF2H are limited. Now, ClCF2H is employed via a difluorocarbene pathway for palladium-catalysed difluoromethylation of arylboronic acids with broad substrate scope.

In situ surface coverage analysis of RuO2-catalysed HCl oxidation reveals the entropic origin of compensation in heterogeneous catalysis

In heterogeneous catalysis, rates with Arrhenius-like temperature dependence are ubiquitous. Compensation phenomena, which arise from the linear correlation between the apparent activation energy and the logarithm of the apparent pre-exponential factor, are also common. Here, we study the origin of compensation and find a similar dependence on the rate-limiting surface coverage term for each Arrhenius parameter. This result is derived from an experimental determination of the surface coverage of oxygen and chlorine species using temporal analysis of products and prompt gamma activation analysis during HCl oxidation to Cl2 on a RuO2 catalyst. It is also substantiated by theory. We find that compensation phenomena appear when the effect on the apparent activation energy caused by changes in surface coverage is balanced out by the entropic configuration contributions of the surface. This result sets a new paradigm in understanding the interplay of compensation effects with the kinetics of heterogeneously catalysed processes. In heterogeneous catalytic processes the Arrhenius parameters are often found to be interrelated (compensation phenomenon). Using state-of-the-art experiments and density functional theory, the origin of compensation is studied. A similar dependence on the rate-limiting surface-coverage term is found for both apparent activation energy and prefactor terms, which can be translated into surface configurational entropy contributions.

Prediction and accelerated laboratory discovery of previously unknown 18-electron ABX compounds

Chemists and material scientists have often focused on the properties of previously reported compounds, but neglect numerous unreported but chemically plausible compounds that could have interesting properties. For example, the 18-valence electron ABX family of compounds features examples of topological insulators, thermoelectrics and piezoelectrics, but only 83 out of 483 of these possible compounds have been made. Using first-principles thermodynamics we examined the theoretical stability of the 400 unreported members and predict that 54 should be stable. Of those previously unreported ‘missing’ materials now predicted to be stable, 15 were grown in this study; X-ray studies agreed with the predicted crystal structure in all 15 cases. Among the predicted and characterized properties of the missing compounds are potential transparent conductors, thermoelectric materials and topological semimetals. This integrated process—prediction of functionality in unreported compounds followed by laboratory synthesis and characterization—could be a route to the systematic discovery of hitherto missing, realizable functional materials. A method to predict the stability, structure and properties of as-yet-unreported materials has been devised. For 18-valence electron ABX materials, 15 such ‘missing’ compounds identified to be thermodynamically stable were successfully synthesized, and showed crystal structures and properties in good agreement with the predicted ones.

Short peptides self-assemble to produce catalytic amyloids

Enzymes fold into unique three-dimensional structures, which underlie their remarkable catalytic properties. The requirement to adopt a stable, folded conformation is likely to contribute to their relatively large size (&gt;10,000&nbsp;Da). However, much shorter peptides can achieve well-defined conformations through the formation of amyloid fibrils. To test whether short amyloid-forming peptides might in fact be capable of enzyme-like catalysis, we designed a series of seven-residue peptides that act as Zn2+-dependent esterases. Zn2+ helps stabilize the fibril formation, while also acting as a cofactor to catalyse acyl ester hydrolysis. These results indicate that prion-like fibrils are able to not only catalyse their own formation, but they can also catalyse chemical reactions. Thus, they might have served as intermediates in the evolution of modern-day enzymes. These results also have implications for the design of self-assembling nanostructured catalysts including ones containing a variety of biological and non-biological metal ions. Amyloid fibril formation is often catalysed by mature fibrils or other aggregates on the fibrillization pathway; however, fibrils cannot normally catalyse other chemical reactions. Here, small seven-residue peptides designed from first principles are shown to form amyloid fibrils that can efficiently catalyse ester hydrolysis.

Title: 
Significantly shorter Fe–S bond in cytochrome P450-I is consistent with greater reactivity relative to chloroperoxidase

Cytochrome P450 (P450) and chloroperoxidase (CPO) are thiolate-ligated haem proteins that catalyse the activation of carbon hydrogen bonds. The principal intermediate in these reactions is a ferryl radical species called compound I. P450 compound I (P450-I) is significantly more reactive than CPO-I, which only cleaves activated C–H bonds. To provide insight into the differing reactivities of these intermediates, we examined CPO-I and P450-I using variable-temperature Mössbauer and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. These measurements indicate that the Fe–S bond is significantly shorter in P450-I than in CPO-I. This difference in Fe–S bond lengths can be understood in terms of variations in the hydrogen-bonding patterns within the ‘cys-pocket’ (a portion of the proximal helix that encircles the thiolate ligand). Weaker hydrogen bonding in P450-I results in a shorter Fe–S bond, which enables greater electron donation from the axial thiolate ligand. This observation may in part explain P450's greater propensity for C–H bond activation. Cytochrome P450 (P450) and chloroperoxidase (CPO) are both thiolate-ligated haem proteins that form a ferryl radical species called compound I. P450-I is, however, significantly more reactive than CPO-I. Variable-temperature Mössbauer and X-ray absorption measurements have now shown that increased electron donation from the axial thiolate ligand in P450-I may explain its greater propensity for C–H bond activation.

Title: 
Synthesis and stability of xenon oxides Xe2O5 and Xe3O2 under pressure

The noble gases are the most inert group of the periodic table, but their reactivity increases with pressure. Diamond-anvil-cell experiments and ab initio modelling have been used to investigate a possible direct reaction between xenon and oxygen at high pressures. We have now synthesized two oxides below 100 GPa (Xe2O5 under oxygen-rich conditions, and Xe3O2 under oxygen-poor conditions), which shows that xenon is more reactive under pressure than predicted previously. Xe2O5 was observed using X-ray diffraction methods, its structure identified through ab initio random structure searching and confirmed using X-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopies. The experiments confirm the recent prediction of Xe3O2 as a stable xenon oxide under high pressure. Xenon atoms adopt mixed oxidation states of 0 and +4 in Xe3O2 and +4 and +6 in Xe2O5. Xe3O2 and Xe2O5 form extended networks that incorporate oxygen-sharing XeO4 squares, and Xe2O5 additionally incorporates oxygen-sharing XeO5 pyramids. Other xenon oxides (XeO2, XeO3) are expected to form at higher pressures. The reactivity of the noble gases—a notoriously inert group—at high pressures is intriguing. Now, two xenon oxides with unusual stoichiometries, Xe2O5 and Xe3O2, have been synthesized above 78 GPa and predicted to be stable above 50 GPa, indicating that xenon is more reactive than previously thought.

Title: 
Self-propelled supramolecular nanomotors with temperature-responsive speed regulation

Self-propelled catalytic micro- and nanomotors have been the subject of intense study over the past few years, but it remains a continuing challenge to build in an effective speed-regulation mechanism. Movement of these motors is generally fully dependent on the concentration of accessible fuel, with propulsive movement only ceasing when the fuel consumption is complete. Here we report a demonstration of control over the movement of self-assembled stomatocyte nanomotors via a molecularly built, stimulus-responsive regulatory mechanism. A temperature-sensitive polymer brush is chemically grown onto the nanomotor, whereby the opening of the stomatocytes is enlarged or narrowed on temperature change, which thus controls the access of hydrogen peroxide fuel and, in turn, regulates movement. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first nanosized chemically driven motor for which motion can be reversibly controlled by a thermally responsive valve/brake. We envision that such artificial responsive nanosystems could have potential applications in controllable cargo transportation. Effective regulation over the motion of self-propelled micro- and nanomotors is a challenging proposition. Now, self-assembled stomatocyte nanomotors with thermoresponsive polymer brushes have been designed that sense changes in local temperature and regulate the accessibility of the hydrogen peroxide fuel — thereby adjusting the speed and behaviour of nanomotor itself.

Enantioselective amine α-functionalization via palladium-catalysed C–H arylation of thioamides

Saturated aza-heterocycles are highly privileged building blocks that are commonly encountered in bioactive compounds and approved therapeutic agents. These N-heterocycles are also incorporated as chiral auxiliaries and ligands in asymmetric synthesis. As such, the development of methods to functionalize the α-methylene C–H bonds of these systems enantioselectively is of great importance, especially in drug discovery. Currently, enantioselective lithiation with (–)-sparteine followed by Pd(0) catalysed cross-coupling to prepare α-arylated amines is largely limited to pyrrolidines. Here we report a Pd(II)-catalysed enantioselective α-C–H coupling of a wide range of amines, which include ethyl amines, azetidines, pyrrolidines, piperidines, azepanes, indolines and tetrahydroisoquinolines. Chiral phosphoric acids are demonstrated as effective anionic ligands for the enantioselective coupling of methylene C–H bonds with aryl boronic acids. This catalytic reaction not only affords high enantioselectivities, but also provides exclusive regioselectivity in the presence of two methylene groups in different steric environments. Chiral, saturated N-heterocycles are prized as pharmaceutical agents and chiral auxiliaries, but are challenging to access without using prefunctionalized starting materials. Now, chiral phosphoric acids are found to enable the enantioselective Pd(II)-catalysed arylation of α-methylene C–H bonds in a wide variety of amines using thioamide as the directing group.

Title: 
Extreme oxatriquinanes and a record C–O bond length

Oxatriquinanes are fused, tricyclic oxonium ions that are known to have exceptional stability compared to simple alkyl oxonium salts. C–O bonds in ethers are generally ∼1.43&nbsp;Å in length, but oxatriquinane has been found to have C–O bond lengths of 1.54&nbsp;Å. A search of the Cambridge Structural Database turned up no bona fide C–O bond length exceeding this value. Computational modelling of oxatriquinane alongside other alkyl oxonium ions indicated that the electronic consequences of molecular strain were primarily responsible for the observed bond elongation. We also show that substitution of the oxatriquinane ring system with alkyl groups of increasing steric demand pushes the C–O bond to unheard of distances, culminating in a tert-butyl derivative at a predicted 1.60&nbsp;Å. Chemical synthesis and an X-ray crystallographic study of these compounds validated the results of the modelling work and, finally, an extraordinary 1.622&nbsp;Å C–O bond was observed in 1,4,7-tri-tert-butyloxatriquinane. Oxatriquinane is a remarkably stable alkyl oxonium ion, despite the fact that its carbon–oxygen bond lengths are 1.54 Å. The robust nature of this fused tricyclic molecule enabled the addition of increasing steric bulk to the system, culminating in a tri-tert-butyloxatriquinane with a record 1.62 Å C–O bond distance.

Vibronic coherence in oxygenic photosynthesis

Photosynthesis powers life on our planet. The basic photosynthetic architecture consists of antenna complexes that harvest solar energy and reaction centres that convert the energy into stable separated charge. In oxygenic photosynthesis, the initial charge separation occurs in the photosystem II reaction centre, the only known natural enzyme that uses solar energy to split water. Both energy transfer and charge separation in photosynthesis are rapid events with high quantum efficiencies. In recent nonlinear spectroscopic experiments, long-lived coherences have been observed in photosynthetic antenna complexes, and theoretical work suggests that they reflect underlying electronic–vibrational resonances, which may play a functional role in enhancing energy transfer. Here, we report the observation of coherent dynamics persisting on a picosecond timescale at 77 K in the photosystem II reaction centre using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. Supporting simulations suggest that the coherences are of a mixed electronic–vibrational (vibronic) nature and may enhance the rate of charge separation in oxygenic photosynthesis. Charge separation in oxygenic photosynthesis occurs with high quantum efficiency and is yet to be fully understood. Using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, coherent dynamics have now been observed in the photosystem II reaction centre, where charge separation occurs. Supporting simulations suggest that the coherences have mixed electronic–vibrational (vibronic) nature, and may enhance the rate of charge separation. Leaf image: © Michael Wesemann/Alamy.

Creating complex molecular topologies by configuring DNA four-way junctions

The realization of complex topologies at the molecular level represents a grand challenge in chemistry. This necessitates the manipulation of molecular interactions with high precision. Here we show that single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) knots and links can be created by utilizing the inherent topological properties that pertain to the DNA four-way junction, at which the two helical strands form a node and can be configured conveniently and connected for complex topological construction. Using this strategy, we produced series of ssDNA topoisomers with the same sequences. By finely designing the curvature and torsion, double-stranded DNA knots were accessed by hybridizing and ligating the complementary strands with the knotted ssDNA templates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a constructed ssDNA knot both to probe the topological conversion catalysed by DNA topoisomerase and to study the DNA replication under topological constraint. The synthesis of topologically non-trivial compounds requires the manipulation of molecular recognition with an extraordinarily high level of control. Now, DNA four-way junctions have been configured to construct synthetic DNA knots and links, which can then be used to investigate important DNA-processing enzymes.

Closed-shell and open-shell square-planar iridium nitrido complexes

Coupling reactions of nitrogen atoms represent elementary steps to many important heterogeneously catalysed reactions, such as the Haber–Bosch process or the selective catalytic reduction of NOx to give N2. For molecular nitrido (and related oxo) complexes, it is well established that the intrinsic reactivity, for example nucleophilicity or electrophilicity of the nitrido (or oxo) ligand, can be attributed to M–N (M–O) ground-state bonding. In recent years, nitrogen (oxygen)-centred radical reactivity was ascribed to the possible redox non-innocence of nitrido (oxo) ligands. However, unequivocal spectroscopic characterization of such transient nitridyl {M=N•} (or oxyl {M–O•}) complexes remained elusive. Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of the novel, closed-shell and open-shell square-planar iridium nitrido complexes [IrN(Lt-Bu)]+ and [IrN(Lt-Bu)] (Lt-Bu=N(CHCHP-t-Bu2)2). Spectroscopic characterization and quantum chemical calculations for [IrN(Lt-Bu)] indicate a considerable nitridyl, {Ir=N•}, radical character. The clean formation of IrI–N2 complexes via binuclear coupling is rationalized in terms of nitrido redox non-innocence in [IrN(Lt-Bu)]. Coupling reactions of nitrogen atoms represent elementary steps to many important, heterogeneously catalysed reactions, such as the Haber–Bosch process or selective catalytic reduction of NOx to N2. Here, the synthesis and characterization of closed- and open-shell, square-planar iridium nitrido complexes is described, indicating considerable nitridyl radical character for the open shell complex.

Incipient class II mixed valency in a plutonium solid-state compound

Electron transfer in mixed-valent transition-metal complexes, clusters and materials is ubiquitous in both natural and synthetic systems. The degree to which intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) occurs, dependent on the degree of delocalization, places these within class II or III of the Robin–Day system. In contrast to the d-block, compounds of f-block elements typically exhibit class I behaviour (no IVCT) because of localization of the valence electrons and poor spatial overlap between metal and ligand orbitals. Here, we report experimental and computational evidence for delocalization of 5f electrons in the mixed-valent PuIII/PuIV solid-state compound, Pu3(DPA)5(H2O)2 (DPA = 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate). The properties of this compound are benchmarked by the pure PuIII and PuIV dipicolinate complexes, [PuIII(DPA)(H2O)4]Br and PuIV(DPA)2(H2O)3·3H2O, as well as by a second mixed-valent compound, PuIII[PuIV(DPA)3H0.5]2, that falls into class I instead. Metal-to-ligand charge transfer is involved in both the formation of Pu3(DPA)5(H2O)2 and in the IVCT. Unlike in the d block, intervalence charge transfer is rare in the 5f block owing to localized valence electrons and poor overlap between metal and ligand orbitals. Delocalization of 5f electrons has now been observed in a Pu(III)/Pu(IV)–pyridinedicarboxylate solid-state compound. It occurs through metal-to-ligand charge transfer with both plutonium centres.

A spray-drying strategy for synthesis of nanoscale metal–organic frameworks and their assembly into hollow superstructures

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most attractive porous materials known today. Their miniaturization to the nanoscale—into nanoMOFs—is expected to serve myriad applications from drug delivery to membranes, to open up novel avenues to more traditional storage and catalysis applications, and to enable the creation of sophisticated superstructures. Here, we report the use of spray-drying as a versatile methodology to assemble nanoMOFs, yielding spherical hollow superstructures with diameters smaller than 5&nbsp;µm. This strategy conceptually mimics the emulsions used by chemists to confine the synthesis of materials, but does not require secondary immiscible solvents or surfactants. We demonstrate that the resulting spherical, hollow superstructures can be processed into stable colloids, whose disassembly by sonication affords discrete, homogeneous nanoMOFs. This spray-drying strategy enables the construction of multicomponent MOF superstructures, and the encapsulation of guest species within these superstructures. We anticipate that this will provide new routes to capsules, reactors and composite materials. Metal–organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles and their assembly into three-dimensional superstructures are attracting attention in various fields. Now, a general spray-drying method has been developed to create more complex hollow spherical MOF superstructures and entrap guest species within them, thereby providing new routes to capsules, reactors and composite materials.

Synthesis of highly strained terpenes by non-stop tail-to-head polycyclization

Non-stop carbocationic polycyclizations of isoprenoids have been called the most complex chemical reactions occurring in nature. We describe a strategy for the initiation of tail-to-head polycyclization that relies on the sequestration of the counteranion away from the carbocation, which allows full propagation of the cationic charge. If the anion is mobile, Coulombic forces hold this species in close proximity to the carbocation and cause preemptive termination through elimination. Anion sequestration is crucial for effecting the biomimetic synthesis of complex and unstable terpenes, including the highly strained funebrenes. This study illustrates the deleterious role of the counterion in tail-to-head carbocationic polycyclization reactions, which to the best of our knowledge has not been rigorously explored. These observations are also expected to find use in the design and control of cationic polycyclization along biosynthetic pathways that have previously been inaccessible in bulk solvent. Sesquiterpenes are biosynthesized from linear isoprenols through the intermediacy of multiple, high-energy carbocations. Here a strategy is demonstrated for mimicking these reactions in bulk solvent to yield strained, acid-labile terpenes. Key to the success of these reactions is the sequestration of the counteranion away from the reactive carbocation, a strategy that should enable further study of challenging polycyclizations.

Catalytic control over supramolecular gel formation

Low-molecular-weight gels show great potential for application in fields ranging from the petrochemical industry to healthcare and tissue engineering. These supramolecular gels are often metastable materials, which implies that their properties are, at least partially, kinetically controlled. Here we show how the mechanical properties and structure of these materials can be controlled directly by catalytic action. We show how in situ catalysis of the formation of gelator molecules can be used to accelerate the formation of supramolecular hydrogels, which drastically enhances their resulting mechanical properties. Using acid or nucleophilic aniline catalysis, it is possible to make supramolecular hydrogels with tunable gel-strength in a matter of minutes, under ambient conditions, starting from simple soluble building blocks. By changing the rate of formation of the gelator molecules using a catalyst, the overall rate of gelation and the resulting gel morphology are affected, which provides access to metastable gel states with improved mechanical strength and appearance despite an identical gelator composition. In situ catalysis of the formation of gelator molecules provides access to metastable gel states with improved mechanical strength compared with uncatalysed gels that have an identical composition. Acid or aniline catalysis enables the formation of hydrogels with tunable gel-strength in a matter of minutes under ambient conditions from simple building blocks.

A motif for reversible nitric oxide interactions in metalloenzymes

Nitric oxide (NO) participates in numerous biological processes, such as signalling in the respiratory system and vasodilation in the cardiovascular system. Many metal-mediated processes involve direct reaction of NO to form a metal–nitrosyl (M–NO), as occurs at the Fe2+ centres of soluble guanylate cyclase or cytochrome c oxidase. However, some copper electron-transfer proteins that bear a type 1 Cu site (His2Cu–Cys) reversibly bind NO by an unknown motif. Here, we use model complexes of type 1 Cu sites based on tris(pyrazolyl)borate copper thiolates [CuII]-SR to unravel the factors involved in NO reactivity. Addition of NO provides the fully characterized S-nitrosothiol adduct [CuI](κ1-N(O)SR), which reversibly loses NO on purging with an inert gas. Computational analysis outlines a low-barrier pathway for the capture and release of NO. These findings suggest a new motif for reversible binding of NO at bioinorganic metal centres that can interconvert NO and RSNO molecular signals at copper sites. NO participates in numerous physiological processes of which many involve the reaction of NO with metalloenzymes to form a metal–nitrosyl (M–NO). Now, addition of NO to models of type 1 Cu sites has provided a fully characterized S-nitrosothiol adduct, [CuI](κ1-N(O)SR), that reversibly loses NO upon purging with an inert gas. These findings suggest a new motif for reversible binding of nitric oxide at bioinorganic metal centres.

Quantifying ligand effects in high-oxidation-state metal catalysis

Catalysis by high-valent metals such as titanium(IV) impacts our lives daily through reactions like olefin polymerization. In any catalysis, optimization involves a careful choice of not just the metal but also the ancillary ligands. Because these choices dramatically impact the electronic structure of the system and, in turn, catalyst performance, new tools for catalyst development are needed. Understanding ancillary ligand effects is arguably one of the most critical aspects of catalyst optimization and, while parameters for phosphines have been used for decades with low-valent systems, a comparable system does not exist for high-valent metals. A new electronic parameter for ligand donation, derived from experiments on a high-valent chromium species, is now available. Here, we show that the new parameters enable quantitative determination of ancillary ligand effects on catalysis rate and, in some cases, even provide mechanistic information. Analysing reactions in this way can be used to design better catalyst architectures and paves the way for the use of such parameters in a host of high-valent processes. Catalysis involving high-valent metals is an important facet of modern chemistry, but tools for catalyst development in this field have lagged behind those for low-valent systems. Now, an experimental system that can accurately model and predict reactivity has been developed to aid high-valent catalyst design.

Title: 
Diversification of self-replicating molecules

How new species emerge in nature is still incompletely understood and difficult to study directly. Self-replicating molecules provide a simple model that allows us to capture the fundamental processes that occur in species formation. We have been able to monitor in real time and at a molecular level the diversification of self-replicating molecules into two distinct sets that compete for two different building blocks (‘food’) and so capture an important aspect of the process by which species may arise. The results show that the second replicator set is a descendant of the first and that both sets are kinetic products that oppose the thermodynamic preference of the system. The sets occupy related but complementary food niches. As diversification into sets takes place on the timescale of weeks and can be investigated at the molecular level, this work opens up new opportunities for experimentally investigating the process through which species arise both in real time and with enhanced detail. Self-replicating molecules provide a simple molecular level system to study the processes occurring in speciation. Now it is shown that in a pool of interconverting macrocycles, constructed from two building blocks, two distinct sets of self-replicating molecules emerge, and that one is a descendant of the other.

Trapping virtual pores by crystal retro-engineering

Stable guest-free porous molecular crystals are uncommon. By contrast, organic molecular crystals with guest-occupied cavities are frequently observed, but these cavities tend to be unstable and collapse on removal of the guests—this feature has been referred to as ‘virtual porosity’. Here, we show how we have trapped the virtual porosity in an unstable low-density organic molecular crystal by introducing a second molecule that matches the size and shape of the unstable voids. We call this strategy ‘retro-engineering’ because it parallels organic retrosynthetic analysis, and it allows the metastable two-dimensional hexagonal pore structure in an organic solvate to be trapped in a binary cocrystal. Unlike the crystal with virtual porosity, the cocrystal material remains single crystalline and porous after removal of guests by heating. Organic molecular crystals with guest-occupied cavities are often observed, but the cavities tend to collapse when the guests are removed. Now, the porous domain of a crystalline solvate has been stabilized by formation of a cocrystal with a second molecule whose size and shape matches those of the unstable voids.

Simulation-guided DNA probe design for consistently ultraspecific hybridization

Hybridization of complementary sequences is one of the central tenets of nucleic acid chemistry; however, the unintended binding of closely related sequences limits the accuracy of hybridization-based approaches to analysing nucleic acids. Thermodynamics-guided probe design and empirical optimization of the reaction conditions have been used to enable the discrimination of single-nucleotide variants, but typically these approaches provide only an approximately 25-fold difference in binding affinity. Here we show that simulations of the binding kinetics are both necessary and sufficient to design nucleic acid probe systems with consistently high specificity as they enable the discovery of an optimal combination of thermodynamic parameters. Simulation-guided probe systems designed against 44 sequences of different target single-nucleotide variants showed between a 200- and 3,000-fold (median 890) higher binding affinity than their corresponding wild-type sequences. As a demonstration of the usefulness of this simulation-guided design approach, we developed probes that, in combination with PCR amplification, detect low concentrations of variant alleles (1%) in human genomic DNA. The use of kinetic simulations to guide the design of competitive hybridization probe systems is shown to enable high selectivity for single-nucleotide variants. Using this approach across 44 cancer mutation/wild-type sequence pairs showed between a 200- and 3,000-fold higher binding affinity than the corresponding wild-type sequence. In combination with PCR amplification this method enabled the detection of a 1% concentration of variant alleles in human genomic DNA.

A total-synthesis framework for the construction of high-order colloidal hybrid nanoparticles

Colloidal hybrid nanoparticles contain multiple nanoscale domains fused together by solid-state interfaces. They represent an emerging class of multifunctional lab-on-a-particle architectures that underpin future advances in solar energy conversion, fuel-cell catalysis, medical imaging and therapy, and electronics. The complexity of these ‘artificial molecules’ is limited ultimately by the lack of a mechanism-driven design framework. Here, we show that known chemical reactions can be applied in a predictable and stepwise manner to build complex hybrid nanoparticle architectures that include M–Pt–Fe3O4 (M&nbsp;=&nbsp;Au, Ag, Ni, Pd) heterotrimers, MxS–Au–Pt–Fe3O4 (M&nbsp;=&nbsp;Pb, Cu) heterotetramers and higher-order oligomers based on the heterotrimeric Au–Pt–Fe3O4 building block. This synthetic framework conceptually mimics the total-synthesis approach used by chemists to construct complex organic molecules. The reaction toolkit applies solid-state nanoparticle analogues of chemoselective reactions, regiospecificity, coupling reactions and molecular substituent effects to the construction of exceptionally complex hybrid nanoparticle oligomers. Colloidal hybrid nanoparticles represent an emerging class of multifunctional artificial molecules. However, unlike actual molecules, their complexity is limited by the lack of a mechanism-driven design framework. Here, nanoparticle analogues of chemoselectivity, regiospecificity, molecular substituent effects, and coupling reactions are used to predictably synthesize hybrid nanoparticle trimers, tetramers, and oligomers.

Magnetic relaxation pathways in lanthanide single-molecule magnets

Single-molecule magnets are compounds that exhibit magnetic bistability caused by an energy barrier for the reversal of magnetization (relaxation). Lanthanide compounds are proving promising as single-molecule magnets: recent studies show that terbium phthalocyanine complexes possess large energy barriers, and dysprosium and terbium complexes bridged by an N23− radical ligand exhibit magnetic hysteresis up to 13&nbsp;K. Magnetic relaxation is typically controlled by single-ion factors rather than magnetic exchange (whether one or more 4f ions are present) and proceeds through thermal relaxation of the lowest excited states. Here we report polylanthanide alkoxide cage complexes, and their doped diamagnetic yttrium analogues, in which competing relaxation pathways are observed and relaxation through the first excited state can be quenched. This leads to energy barriers for relaxation of magnetization that exceed 800&nbsp;K. We investigated the factors at the lanthanide sites that govern this behaviour. Dysprosium alkoxides and dysprosium-doped yttrium alkoxides show very large energy barriers, greater than 800&nbsp;K, to magnetic relaxation. These barriers arise from the presence of a strongly axial pseudo-octahedral crystal field, which switches off relaxation through the first excited state that typically occurs in single-molecule magnets, and favours a competitive pathway through higher-energy states.

Structure and catalytic properties of the most complex intergrown zeolite ITQ-39 determined by electron crystallography

Porous materials such as zeolites contain well-defined pores in molecular dimensions and have important industrial applications in catalysis, sorption and separation. Aluminosilicates with intersecting 10- and 12-ring channels are particularly interesting as selective catalysts. Many porous materials, especially zeolites, form only nanosized powders and some are intergrowths of different structures, making structure determination very challenging. Here, we report the atomic structures of an aluminosilicate zeolite family, ITQ-39, solved from nanocrystals only a few unit cells in size by electron crystallography. ITQ-39 is an intergrowth of three different polymorphs, built from the same layer but with different stacking sequences. ITQ-39 contains stacking faults and twinning with nano-sized domains, being the most complex zeolite ever solved. The unique structure of ITQ-39, with a three-dimensional intersecting pairwise 12-ring and 10-ring pore system, makes it a promising catalyst for converting naphtha into diesel fuel, a process of emerging interest for the petrochemical industry. Solving the structure of zeolites is often challenging because of their small particle size. Now, electron crystallography reveals the structure of a family of complex intergrown zeolite materials. These zeolites contain unique pair-wise 12-ring channels that intersect with 10-ring channels, and are promising catalysts for converting gasoline into diesel fuel.

Mechanically controlled quantum interference in individual π-stacked dimers

Recent observations of destructive quantum interference in single-molecule junctions confirm the role of quantum effects in the electronic conductance properties of molecular systems. These effects are central to a broad range of chemical and biological processes and may be beneficial for the design of single-molecule electronic components to exploit the intrinsic quantum effects that occur at the molecular scale. Here we show that destructive interference can be turned on or off within the same molecular system by mechanically controlling its conformation. Using a combination of ab initio calculations and single-molecule conductance measurements, we demonstrate the existence of a quasiperiodic destructive quantum-interference pattern along the breaking traces of π-stacked molecular dimers. The results demonstrate that it is possible to control the molecular conductance over more than one order of magnitude and with a sub-ångström resolution by exploiting the subtle structure–property relationship of π-stacked dimers. Single-molecule junctions provide a unique platform to understand how molecular structure affects electronic transport. Now it has been shown that electronic transport through a π-stacked dimer can be precisely controlled when pulling it apart. This behaviour is caused by quantum interference effects that are turned ON or OFF depending on dimer conformation.

Why copper is preferred over iron for oxygen activation and reduction in haem-copper oxidases

Haem–copper oxidase (HCO) catalyses the natural reduction of oxygen to water using a haem-copper centre. Despite decades of research on HCOs, the role of non-haem metal and the reason for nature's choice of copper over other metals such as iron remains unclear. Here, we use a biosynthetic model of HCO in myoglobin that selectively binds different non-haem metals to demonstrate 30-fold and 11-fold enhancements in the oxidase activity of Cu- and Fe-bound HCO mimics, respectively, as compared with Zn-bound mimics. Detailed electrochemical, kinetic and vibrational spectroscopic studies, in tandem with theoretical density functional theory calculations, demonstrate that the non-haem metal not only donates electrons to oxygen but also activates it for efficient O–O bond cleavage. Furthermore, the higher redox potential of copper and the enhanced weakening of the O–O bond from the higher electron density in the d orbital of copper are central to its higher oxidase activity over iron. This work resolves a long-standing question in bioenergetics, and renders a chemical–biological basis for the design of future oxygen-reduction catalysts. Despite decades of research into heme-copper oxidases, the advantages provided by copper over iron as the non-heme metal has remained unclear. Now, the preference of copper over iron has finally been explained. Copper favours faster electron transfer and higher O–O bond activation, which results in much higher oxidase activity than would be achieved by an iron equivalent.

Oxidase catalysis via aerobically generated hypervalent iodine intermediates

The development of sustainable oxidation chemistry demands strategies to harness O2 as a terminal oxidant. Oxidase catalysis, in which O2 serves as a chemical oxidant without necessitating incorporation of oxygen into reaction products, would allow diverse substrate functionalization chemistry to be coupled to O2 reduction. Direct O2 utilization suffers from intrinsic challenges imposed by the triplet ground state of O2 and the disparate electron inventories of four-electron O2 reduction and two-electron substrate oxidation. Here, we generate hypervalent iodine reagents—a broadly useful class of selective two-electron oxidants—from O2. This is achieved by intercepting reactive intermediates of aldehyde autoxidation to aerobically generate hypervalent iodine reagents for a broad array of substrate oxidation reactions. The use of aryl iodides as mediators of aerobic oxidation underpins an oxidase catalysis platform that couples substrate oxidation directly to O2 reduction. We anticipate that aerobically generated hypervalent iodine reagents will expand the scope of aerobic oxidation chemistry in chemical synthesis. Oxidation chemistry is critical to introducing molecular complexity during chemical synthesis. Development of sustainable oxidation chemistry demands strategies to harness O2 as a terminal oxidant. Access to hypervalent iodine compounds — a class of broadly useful chemical oxidants — from O2 increases the scope of aerobic oxidation chemistry that can be achieved.

Installing logic-gate responses to a variety of biological substances in supramolecular hydrogel–enzyme hybrids

Soft materials that exhibit stimuli-responsive behaviour under aqueous conditions (such as supramolecular hydrogels composed of self-assembled nanofibres) have many potential biological applications. However, designing a macroscopic response to structurally complex biochemical stimuli in these materials still remains a challenge. Here we show that redox-responsive peptide-based hydrogels have the ability to encapsulate enzymes and still retain their activities. Moreover, cooperative coupling of enzymatic reactions with the gel response enables us to construct unique stimuli-responsive soft materials capable of sensing a variety of disease-related biomarkers. The programmable gel–sol response (even to biological samples) is visible to the naked eye. Furthermore, we built Boolean logic gates (OR and AND) into the hydrogel–enzyme hybrid materials, which were able to sense simultaneously plural specific biochemicals and execute a controlled drug release in accordance with the logic operation. The intelligent soft materials that we have developed may prove valuable in future medical diagnostics or treatments. Soft materials that can undergo a macroscopic change in response to external stimuli may prove useful for a range of biological applications. Now, it has been shown that hydrogels encapsulating active enzymes can undergo a gel–sol transition in the presence of a range of small-molecule triggers and can potentially be used as sensors or drug-delivery systems.

Phase behaviour of disordered proteins underlying low density and high permeability of liquid organelles

Many intracellular membraneless organelles form via phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or regions (IDRs). These include the Caenorhabditis elegans protein LAF-1, which forms P granule-like droplets in vitro. However, the role of protein disorder in phase separation and the macromolecular organization within droplets remain elusive. Here, we utilize a novel technique, ultrafast-scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to measure the molecular interactions and full coexistence curves (binodals), which quantify the protein concentration within LAF-1 droplets. The binodals of LAF-1 and its IDR display a number of unusual features, including ‘high concentration’ binodal arms that correspond to remarkably dilute droplets. We find that LAF-1 and other in vitro and intracellular droplets are characterized by an effective mesh size of ∼3–8 nm, which determines the size scale at which droplet properties impact molecular diffusion and permeability. These findings reveal how specific IDPs can phase separate to form permeable, low-density (semi-dilute) liquids, whose structural features are likely to strongly impact biological function. Ultrafast-scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy has now been used to measure the molecular interactions underlying the phase behaviour of disordered proteins. Sequence-encoded conformational fluctuations of these proteins are shown to give rise to phase-separated droplets of surprisingly low concentrations. These results provide insight into how the structural features of the droplets affect the properties of liquid-phase intracellular organelles.

Unique physicochemical and catalytic properties dictated by the B3NO2 ring system

The expansion of molecular diversity beyond what nature can produce is a fundamental objective in chemical sciences. Despite the rich chemistry of boron-containing heterocycles, the 1,3-dioxa-5-aza-2,4,6-triborinane (DATB) ring system, which is characterized by a six-membered B3NO2 core, remains elusive. Here, we report the synthesis of m-terphenyl-templated DATB derivatives, displaying high stability and peculiar Lewis acidity arising from the three suitably arranged boron atoms. We identify a particular utility for DATB in the dehydrative amidation of carboxylic acids and amines, a reaction of high academic and industrial importance. The three boron sites are proposed to engage in substrate assembly, lowering the entropic cost of the transition state, in contrast with the operative mechanism of previously reported catalysts and amide coupling reagents. The distinct mechanistic pathway dictated by the DATB core will advance not only such amidations, but also other reactions driven by multisite activation. Amidation is one of the most widely utilized organic reactions for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and functional materials. DATB, characterized by the B3NO2 heterocycle, proved to act as a superb catalyst for the direct amidation with a distinct mechanistic pathway, displaying broadened applicability to a wide range of substrates.

Reversible hydrogen storage using CO2 and a proton-switchable iridium catalyst in aqueous media under mild temperatures and pressures

Green plants convert CO2 to sugar for energy storage via photosynthesis. We report a novel catalyst that uses CO2 and hydrogen to store energy in formic acid. Using a homogeneous iridium catalyst with a proton-responsive ligand, we show the first reversible and recyclable hydrogen storage system that operates under mild conditions using CO2, formate and formic acid. This system is energy-efficient and green because it operates near ambient conditions, uses water as a solvent, produces high-pressure CO-free hydrogen, and uses pH to control hydrogen production or consumption. The extraordinary and switchable catalytic activity is attributed to the multifunctional ligand, which acts as a proton-relay and strong π-donor, and is rationalized by theoretical and experimental studies. When operating at near-ambient conditions, using water as a solvent, a high-turnover iridium catalyst enables a reversible hydrogen storage system that uses carbon dioxide, formate and formic acid. Proton-responsive ligands in the catalyst allow it to be turned on or off by controlling the pH of the solution.

Revealing the macromolecular targets of complex natural products

Natural products have long been a source of useful biological activity for the development of new drugs. Their macromolecular targets are, however, largely unknown, which hampers rational drug design and optimization. Here we present the development and experimental validation of a computational method for the discovery of such targets. The technique does not require three-dimensional target models and may be applied to structurally complex natural products. The algorithm dissects the natural products into fragments and infers potential pharmacological targets by comparing the fragments to synthetic reference drugs with known targets. We demonstrate that this approach results in confident predictions. In a prospective validation, we show that fragments of the potent antitumour agent archazolid A, a macrolide from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra, contain relevant information regarding its polypharmacology. Biochemical and biophysical evaluation confirmed the predictions. The results obtained corroborate the practical applicability of the computational approach to natural product ‘de-orphaning’. Natural products provide a rich source of leads for drug discovery. Now, a computational method is available that can be used to identify the macromolecular targets of these compounds. Much like medicinal chemists' reasoning, the software infers target information by comparing the substructures with those of drugs and other natural products with known targets.

Conversion of 1-alkenes into 1,4-diols through an auxiliary-mediated formal homoallylic C–H oxidation

The ubiquitous nature of C–H bonds in organic molecules makes them attractive as a target for rapid complexity generation, but brings with it the problem of achieving selective reactions. In developing new methodologies for C–H functionalization, alkenes are an attractive starting material because of their abundance and low cost. Here we describe the conversion of 1-alkenes into 1,4-diols. The method involves the installation of a new Si,N-type chelating auxiliary group on the alkene followed by iridium-catalysed C–H silylation of an unactivated δ-C(sp3)–H bond to produce a silolane intermediate. Oxidation of the C–Si bonds affords a 1,4-diol. The method is demonstrated to have broad scope and good functional group compatibility by application to the selective 1,4-oxygenation of several natural products and derivatives. Selective C–H functionalization reactions often rely on the directing effects of chelating groups embedded within the substrate. Here, an alkene hydrosilylation is used to install a pyridine-containing auxiliary that subsequently directs C–H functionalization at the homoallylic position. Oxidation of the silacycle product results in a formal 1,4-dioxygenation of an alkene.

Title: 
Detection of different oxidation states of individual manganese porphyrins during their reaction with oxygen at a solid/liquid interface

Manganese porphyrins have been extensively investigated as model systems for the natural enzyme cytochrome P450 and as synthetic oxidation catalysts. Here, we report single-molecule studies of the multistep reaction of manganese porphyrins with molecular oxygen at a solid/liquid interface, using a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) under environmental control. The high lateral resolution of the STM, in combination with its sensitivity to subtle differences in the electronic properties of molecules, allowed the detection of at least four distinct reaction species. Real-space and real-time imaging of reaction dynamics enabled the observation of active sites, immobile on the experimental timescale. Conversions between the different species could be tuned by the composition of the atmosphere (argon, air or oxygen) and the surface bias voltage. By means of extensive comparison of the results to those obtained by analogous solution-based chemistry, we assigned the observed species to the starting compound, reaction intermediates and products. A scanning tunnelling microscope has been used to image multistep chemical reactions at a solid/liquid interface with single-molecule resolution. On reacting Mn(III) porphyrins with either O2 or a single oxygen donor, at least four distinct reaction intermediates and products were detected and their interconversion could be observed in real space and real time.

An aptamer-functionalized chemomechanically modulated biomolecule catch-and-release system

The efficient extraction of (bio)molecules from fluid mixtures is vital for applications ranging from target characterization in (bio)chemistry to environmental analysis and biomedical diagnostics. Inspired by biological processes that seamlessly synchronize the capture, transport and release of biomolecules, we designed a robust chemomechanical sorting system capable of the concerted catch and release of target biomolecules from a solution mixture. The hybrid system is composed of target-specific, reversible binding sites attached to microscopic fins embedded in a responsive hydrogel that moves the cargo between two chemically distinct environments. To demonstrate the utility of the system, we focus on the effective separation of thrombin by synchronizing the pH-dependent binding strength of a thrombin-specific aptamer with volume changes of the pH-responsive hydrogel in a biphasic microfluidic regime, and show a non-destructive separation that has a quantitative sorting efficiency, as well as the system's stability and amenability to multiple solution recycling. The extraction of (bio)molecules from fluid mixtures is vital for applications ranging from biomedical diagnostics to environmental analysis. Now a robust chemomechanical sorting system for the extraction of thrombin is described in which pH-dependent binding of the analyte to a specific aptamer is combined with volume changes of the pH-responsive hydrogel in a biphasic microfluidic regime, resulting in a catch-and-release system.

Singlet exciton fission in solution

Singlet exciton fission, the spin-conserving process that produces two triplet excited states from one photoexcited singlet state, is a means to circumvent the Shockley–Queisser limit in single-junction solar cells. Although the process through which singlet fission occurs is not well characterized, some local order is thought to be necessary for intermolecular coupling. Here, we report a triplet yield of 200% and triplet formation rates approaching the diffusion limit in solutions of bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS)) pentacene. We observe a transient bound excimer intermediate, formed by the collision of one photoexcited and one ground-state TIPS-pentacene molecule. The intermediate breaks up when the two triplets separate to each TIPS-pentacene molecule. This efficient system is a model for future singlet-fission materials and for disordered device components that produce cascades of excited states from sunlight. Singlet exciton fission produces two triplet excited states from one excited singlet through interchromophoric coupling, which is thought to require local order. Now, a triplet yield of 200% and diffusion-limited triplet formation are reported in solutions of TIPS pentacene. Kinetic studies revealed an excimer intermediate and enabled suggestions of design principles for the promotion of singlet fission.

Title: 
Crystalline coordination framework endowed with dynamic gate-opening behaviour by being downsized to a thin film

The fabrication of porous coordination frameworks in thin-film forms has been investigated intensively with a view to using their structural response to external stimuli and guests for potential nanotechnological applications, for example as membranes for gas separation. Here we report a coordination framework that exhibits a dynamic guest-sorption behaviour in a nanometre-sized thin-film form (16 nm thick), yet shows no guest uptake in the bulk. Highly oriented crystalline thin films of this coordination framework—which consists of interdigitated two-dimensional layers of {Fe(py)2[Pt(CN)4]} (py, pyridine)—were fabricated through liquid-phase layer-by-layer synthesis. The resulting thin film exhibited a clear guest uptake with a structural transformation of the gate-opening type as characterized by in situ X-ray diffraction. Increasing the film's thickness markedly suppressed this behaviour. We envisage that such a crystal-downsizing effect may be observed with other coordination frameworks, and may be of use to develop functional materials, for example, for switching or sensing devices. The sorption properties of a metal–organic framework (MOF) typically depend on its structure. Now, a MOF that consists of interdigitated layers has been prepared that does not take up guests in its bulk or thick-film form, yet does so—with a dynamic gate-opening behaviour—in thin-film form.

Synthesis of giant globular multivalent glycofullerenes as potent inhibitors in a model of Ebola virus infection

The use of multivalent carbohydrate compounds to block cell-surface lectin receptors is a promising strategy to inhibit the entry of pathogens into cells and could lead to the discovery of novel antiviral agents. One of the main problems with this approach, however, is that it is difficult to make compounds of an adequate size and multivalency to mimic natural systems such as viruses. Hexakis adducts of [60]fullerene are useful building blocks in this regard because they maintain a globular shape at the same time as allowing control over the size and multivalency. Here we report water-soluble tridecafullerenes decorated with 120 peripheral carbohydrate subunits, so-called ‘superballs’, that can be synthesized efficiently from hexakis adducts of [60]fullerene in one step by using copper-catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry. Infection assays show that these superballs are potent inhibitors of cell infection by an artificial Ebola virus with half-maximum inhibitory concentrations in the subnanomolar range. Tridecafullerenes with 120 peripheral carbohydrate groups have been made in one step from hexakis-adducts of [60]fullerene by using azide–alkyne click chemistry. This synthetic approach offers control over the size and multivalency of these ‘sugar superballs', which are shown to be potent inhibitors of cell infection by an artificial Ebola virus, with IC50 values in the sub-nanomolar range.

Title: 
Dithiol amino acids can structurally shape and enhance the ligand-binding properties of polypeptides

The disulfide bonds that form between two cysteine residues are important in defining and rigidifying the structures of proteins and peptides. In polypeptides containing multiple cysteine residues, disulfide isomerization can lead to multiple products with different biological activities. Here, we describe the development of a dithiol amino acid (Dtaa) that can form two disulfide bridges at a single amino acid site. Application of Dtaas to a serine protease inhibitor and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor inhibitor that contain disulfide constraints enhanced their inhibitory activities 40- and 7.6-fold, respectively. X-ray crystallographic and NMR structure analysis show that the peptide ligands containing Dtaas have retained their native tertiary structures. We furthermore show that replacement of two cysteines by Dtaas can avoid the formation of disulfide bond isomers. With these properties, Dtaas are likely to have broad application in the rational design or directed evolution of peptides and proteins with high activity and stability. Disulfide bonds formed between two cysteine residues are important in the folding and stability of proteins. Now, unnatural amino acids with side-chains that contain two thiol groups are described. Incorporation of these dithiol amino acids into a serine protease inhibitor and a nicotinic acetyl choline receptor antagonist is shown to increase their inhibitory activity.

Use of a biosynthetic intermediate to explore the chemical diversity of pseudo-natural fungal polyketides

The structural complexity and diversity of natural products make them attractive sources for potential drug discovery, with their characteristics being derived from the multi-step combination of enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversions of intermediates in each biosynthetic pathway. Intermediates that exhibit multipotent behaviour have great potential for use as starting points in diversity-oriented synthesis. Inspired by the biosynthetic pathways that form complex metabolites from simple intermediates, we developed a semi-synthetic process that combines heterologous biosynthesis and artificial diversification. The heterologous biosynthesis of fungal polyketide intermediates led to the isolation of novel oligomers and provided evidence for ortho-quinonemethide equivalency in their isochromene form. The intrinsic reactivity of the isochromene polyketide enabled us to access various new chemical entities by modifying and remodelling the polyketide core and through coupling with indole molecules. We thus succeeded in generating exceptionally diverse pseudo-natural polyketides through this process and demonstrated an advanced method of using biosynthetic intermediates. The complexity and diversity of natural product structures make them an ideal starting point for the creation of chemical libraries. Now it is shown that a semi-synthetic process can combine heterologous expression of a multipotent biosynthetic intermediate with multiple non-enzymatic steps to produce libraries of pseudo-natural products.

Observation of an all-boron fullerene

After the discovery of fullerene-C60, it took almost two decades for the possibility of boron-based fullerene structures to be considered. So far, there has been no experimental evidence for these nanostructures, in spite of the progress made in theoretical investigations of their structure and bonding. Here we report the observation, by photoelectron spectroscopy, of an all-boron fullerene-like cage cluster at B40− with an extremely low electron-binding energy. Theoretical calculations show that this arises from a cage structure with a large energy gap, but that a quasi-planar isomer of B40− with two adjacent hexagonal holes is slightly more stable than the fullerene structure. In contrast, for neutral B40 the fullerene-like cage is calculated to be the most stable structure. The surface of the all-boron fullerene, bonded uniformly via delocalized σ and π bonds, is not perfectly smooth and exhibits unusual heptagonal faces, in contrast to C60 fullerene. Main-group analogues to fullerene-C60 have been predicted theoretically many times. Now, B40− has been observed using photoelectron spectroscopy and, with its neutral analogue, B40, confirmed computationally. In contrast to fullerene-C60, the all-boron fullerene (or borospherene) features triangles, hexagons and heptagons, bonded uniformly by delocalized σ and π bonds over the cage surface.

Shaping quaternary assemblies of water-soluble non-peptide helical foldamers by sequence manipulation

The design and construction of biomimetic self-assembling systems is a challenging yet potentially highly rewarding endeavour that contributes to the development of new biomaterials, catalysts, drug-delivery systems and tools for the manipulation of biological processes. Significant progress has been achieved by engineering self-assembling DNA-, protein- and peptide-based building units. However, the design of entirely new, completely non-natural folded architectures that resemble biopolymers (‘foldamers’) and have the ability to self-assemble into atomically precise nanostructures in aqueous conditions has proved exceptionally challenging. Here we report the modular design, formation and structural elucidation at the atomic level of a series of diverse quaternary arrangements formed by the self-assembly of short amphiphilic α-helicomimetic foldamers that bear proteinaceous side chains. We show that the final quaternary assembly can be controlled at the sequence level, which permits the programmed formation of either discrete helical bundles that contain isolated cavities or pH-responsive water-filled channels with controllable pore diameters. The self-assembly of short amphiphilic α-helicomimetic foldamers bearing proteinaceous side-chains can be controlled by manipulating the side-chain sequence. This enables the foldamers to be programmed to form either discrete helical bundles containing isolated cavities, or pH-responsive water-filled channels with controllable pore diameters.

Predatory behaviour in synthetic protocell communities

Recent progress in the chemical construction of colloidal objects comprising integrated biomimetic functions is paving the way towards rudimentary forms of artificial cell-like entities (protocells). Although several new types of protocells are currently available, the design of synthetic protocell communities and investigation of their collective behaviour has received little attention. Here we demonstrate an artificial form of predatory behaviour in a community of protease-containing coacervate microdroplets and protein–polymer microcapsules (proteinosomes) that interact via electrostatic binding. The coacervate microdroplets act as killer protocells for the obliteration of the target proteinosome population by protease-induced lysis of the protein–polymer membrane. As a consequence, the proteinosome payload (dextran, single-stranded DNA, platinum nanoparticles) is trafficked into the attached coacervate microdroplets, which are then released as functionally modified killer protocells capable of rekilling. Our results highlight opportunities for the development of interacting artificial protocell communities, and provide a strategy for inducing collective behaviour in soft matter microcompartmentalized systems and synthetic protocell consortia. The chemical construction of compartmentalized colloidal objects with biomimetic functions and collective properties is a key challenge in synthetic protocell research. Now, an interacting binary community of protocells has been designed to display artificial predatory behaviour in which protease-containing coacervate microdroplets obliterate a population of proteinosomes, and capture a chemical payload via a simple trafficking process.

Title: 
Flow chemistry and polymer-supported pseudoenantiomeric acylating agents enable parallel kinetic resolution of chiral saturated N-heterocycles

Kinetic resolution is a common method to obtain enantioenriched material from a racemic mixture. This process will deliver enantiopure unreacted material when the selectivity factor of the process, s, is greater than 1; however, the scalemic reaction product is often discarded. Parallel kinetic resolution, on the other hand, provides access to two enantioenriched products from a single racemic starting material, but suffers from a variety of practical challenges regarding experimental design that limit its applications. Here, we describe the development of a flow-based system that enables practical parallel kinetic resolution of saturated N-heterocycles. This process provides access to both enantiomers of the starting material in good yield and high enantiopurity; similar results with classical kinetic resolution would require selectivity factors in the range of s = 100. To achieve this, two immobilized quasienantiomeric acylating agents were designed for the asymmetric acylation of racemic saturated N-heterocycles. Using the flow-based system we could efficiently separate, recover and reuse the polymer-supported reagents. The amide products could be readily separated and hydrolysed to the corresponding amines without detectable epimerization. Parallel kinetic resolution (PKR) of N-heterocycles via asymmetric acylation has been achieved using quasienantiomers of polymer supported hydroxamic acid reagents. Flow techniques provide physical separation of the reagents, establishing a practical implementation of PKR. The enantioenriched amide products can be readily deprotected to reveal the desired amine without detectable epimerization.

Title: 
Dissecting the mechanisms of a class of chemical glycosylation using primary 13C kinetic isotope effects

Although arguably the most important reaction in glycoscience, chemical glycosylations are among the least well understood of organic chemical reactions, resulting in an unnecessarily high degree of empiricism and a brake on rational development in this critical area. To address this problem, primary 13C kinetic isotope effects have now been determined for the formation of β- and α-manno- and glucopyranosides using a natural abundance NMR method. In contrast to the common current assumption, for three of the four cases studied the experimental and computed values are indicative of associative displacement of the intermediate covalent glycosyl trifluoromethanesulfonates. For the formation of the α-mannopyranosides, the experimentally determined KIE differs significantly from that computed for an associative displacement, which is strongly suggestive of a dissociative mechanism that approaches the intermediacy of a glycosyl oxocarbenium ion. The application of analogous experiments to other glycosylation systems should shed further light on their mechanisms and thus assist in the design of better reactions conditions with improved stereoselectivity. Chemical glycosylations are perhaps the most important reactions in glycoscience, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Here, quantum chemical calculations combined with natural-abundance NMR measurements of 13C kinetic isotope effects reveal both associative and dissociative mechanisms at the extremes of a continuum that depends on the relative stereochemistry of the substrate and the anomeric configuration of the product.

Installing hydrolytic activity into a completely de novo protein framework

The design of enzyme-like catalysts tests our understanding of sequence-to-structure/function relationships in proteins. Here we install hydrolytic activity predictably into a completely de novo and thermostable α-helical barrel, which comprises seven helices arranged around an accessible channel. We show that the lumen of the barrel accepts 21 mutations to functional polar residues. The resulting variant, which has cysteine–histidine–glutamic acid triads on each helix, hydrolyses p-nitrophenyl acetate with catalytic efficiencies that match the most-efficient redesigned hydrolases based on natural protein scaffolds. This is the first report of a functional catalytic triad engineered into a de novo protein framework. The flexibility of our system also allows the facile incorporation of unnatural side chains to improve activity and probe the catalytic mechanism. Such a predictable and robust construction of truly de novo biocatalysts holds promise for applications in chemical and biochemical synthesis. Functional catalytic triads have been designed into a hyperstable heptameric α-helical barrel protein. Twenty-one mutations were introduced to form seven Cys-His-Glu catalytic triads. The resulting protein hydrolyses p-nitrophenyl acetate with activities matching the most-efficient redesigned hydrolases based on natural protein scaffolds. This is the first example of a functional catalytic triad being engineered into a fully de novo protein.

Catalytic enantioselective addition of organoboron reagents to fluoroketones controlled by electrostatic interactions

Organofluorine compounds are central to modern chemistry, and broadly applicable transformations that generate them efficiently and enantioselectively are in much demand. Here we introduce efficient catalytic methods for the addition of allyl and allenyl organoboron reagents to fluorine-substituted ketones. These reactions are facilitated by readily and inexpensively available catalysts and deliver versatile and otherwise difficult-to-access tertiary homoallylic alcohols in up to 98% yield and &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio. Utility is highlighted by a concise enantioselective approach to the synthesis of the antiparasitic drug fluralaner (Bravecto, presently sold as the racemate). Different forms of ammonium–organofluorine interactions play a key role in the control of enantioselectivity. The greater understanding of various non-bonding interactions afforded by these studies should facilitate the future development of transformations that involve fluoroorganic entities. Organofluorine compounds are important to medical, agricultural and materials research. Now, small organic molecules may be used to catalyse reactions of fluorinated ketones with organoboron reagents, yielding tertiary homoallylic alcohols in high enantiomeric purity. Electrostatic interactions between a catalyst's ammonium group and fluoro-organic substrate are key to control of stereoselectivity.

Palladium-triggered deprotection chemistry for protein activation in living cells

Employing small molecules or chemical reagents to modulate the function of an intracellular protein, particularly in a gain-of-function fashion, remains a challenge. In contrast to inhibitor-based loss-of-function approaches, methods based on a gain of function enable specific signalling pathways to be activated inside a cell. Here we report a chemical rescue strategy that uses a palladium-mediated deprotection reaction to activate a protein within living cells. We identify biocompatible and efficient palladium catalysts that cleave the propargyl carbamate group of a protected lysine analogue to generate a free lysine. The lysine analogue can be genetically and site-specifically incorporated into a protein, which enables control over the reaction site. This deprotection strategy is shown to work with a range of different cell lines and proteins. We further applied this biocompatible protection group/catalyst pair for caging and subsequent release of a crucial lysine residue in a bacterial Type III effector protein within host cells, which reveals details of its virulence mechanism. Restoring a protein's function in response to specific stimuli can enable a signalling pathway to be activated and the effect monitored over time. Here, a chemical rescue strategy for restoring protein function inside live cells is described, in which palladium catalysts are used to deprotect a propargylcarbamate group of a lysine analogue.

A flow-system array for the discovery and scale up of inorganic clusters

The batch synthesis of inorganic clusters can be both time consuming and limited by a lack of reproducibility. Flow-system approaches, now common in organic synthesis, have not been utilized widely for the synthesis of clusters. Herein we combine an automated flow process with multiple batch crystallizations for the screening and scale up of syntheses of polyoxometalates and manganese-based single-molecule magnets. Scale up of the synthesis of these architectures was achieved by programming a multiple-pump reactor system to vary reaction conditions sequentially, and thus explore a larger parameter space in a shorter time than conventionally possible. Also, the potential for using the array as a discovery tool is demonstrated. Successful conditions for product isolation were identified easily from the array of reactions, and a direct route to ‘scale up’ was then immediately available simply by continuous application of these flow conditions. In all cases, large quantities of phase-pure material were obtained and the time taken for the discovery, repetition and scale up decreased. The discovery and synthesis of inorganic clusters can be both time consuming and limited by a lack of reproducibility. An automated flow process coupled with multiple batch crystallization has now been successfully used to rapidly screen and scale-up the syntheses of inorganic clusters, including polyoxometalates and manganese-based single-molecule magnets.

Equilibrium between a cyclotrisilene and an isolable base adduct of a disilenyl silylene

In organic chemistry, compounds with adjacent alkene and carbene functionalities (vinyl carbenes) are studied widely as fleeting intermediates and in the coordination sphere of transition metals. Stable derivatives of vinyl carbenes remain elusive, including the corresponding heavier group 14 homologues. Here we report the isolation and full characterization of a base-stabilized silicon version of a vinyl carbene that features a silicon–silicon double bond as well as a silylene functionality, coordinated by an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC). In solution, the intensely green disilenyl silylene adduct exists in equilibrium with the corresponding silicon analogue of a cyclopropene and free NHC, which was quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy. The reversibility of this process raises exciting possibilities for the preparation of extended conjugated π systems of silicon. A base-stabilized silicon analogue of a reactive carbon species (vinyl carbene) is reported that features a silicon–silicon double bond and a silylene functionality, coordinated by an N-heterocyclic carbene. Ultraviolet–visible light and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in solution confirms that disilenyl silylene exists in equilibrium with the corresponding cyclotrisilene and free N-heterocyclic carbene.

Tuning the driving force for exciton dissociation in single-walled carbon nanotube heterojunctions

Understanding the kinetics and energetics of interfacial electron transfer in molecular systems is crucial for the development of a broad array of technologies, including photovoltaics, solar fuel systems and energy storage. The Marcus formulation for electron transfer relates the thermodynamic driving force and reorganization energy for charge transfer between a given donor/acceptor pair to the kinetics and yield of electron transfer. Here we investigated the influence of the thermodynamic driving force for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and fullerene derivatives by employing time-resolved microwave conductivity as a sensitive probe of interfacial exciton dissociation. For the first time, we observed the Marcus inverted region (in which driving force exceeds reorganization energy) and quantified the reorganization energy for PET for a model SWCNT/acceptor system. The small reorganization energies (about 130 meV, most of which probably arises from the fullerene acceptors) are beneficial in minimizing energy loss in photoconversion schemes. The influence of the thermodynamic driving force for photoinduced electron-transfer between single-walled carbon nanotubes and fullerene derivatives has been investigated. The Marcus inverted region and small reorganization energies were observed for this model organic heterojunction. Small reorganization energies aid in minimizing energy losses for solar conversion to electricity or fuels.

Volume-conserving trans–cis isomerization pathways in photoactive yellow protein visualized by picosecond X-ray crystallography

Trans-to-cis isomerization, the key reaction in photoactive proteins, usually cannot occur through the standard one-bond-flip mechanism. Owing to spatial constraints imposed by a protein environment, isomerization probably proceeds through a volume-conserving mechanism in which highly choreographed atomic motions are expected, the details of which have not yet been observed directly. Here we employ time-resolved X-ray crystallography to visualize structurally the isomerization of the p-coumaric acid chromophore in photoactive yellow protein with a time resolution of 100 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.6&nbsp;Å. The structure of the earliest intermediate (IT) resembles a highly strained transition state in which the torsion angle is located halfway between the trans- and cis-isomers. The reaction trajectory of IT bifurcates into two structurally distinct cis intermediates via hula-twist and bicycle-pedal pathways. The bifurcating reaction pathways can be controlled by weakening the hydrogen bond between the chromophore and an adjacent residue through E46Q mutation, which switches off the bicycle-pedal pathway. Time-resolved X-ray crystallography on photoactive yellow protein shows the existence of a short-lived, highly distorted intermediate whose reaction trajectory bifurcates along ‘bicycle-pedal’ and ‘hula-twist’ pathways. The bifurcating reaction pathways can be controlled by weakening the hydrogen bond between the chromophore and an adjacent residue, which switches off the bicycle-pedal pathway.

Parameterization of phosphine ligands demonstrates enhancement of nickel catalysis via remote steric effects

The field of Ni-catalysed cross-coupling has seen rapid recent growth because of the low cost of Ni, its earth abundance, and its ability to promote unique cross-coupling reactions. Whereas advances in the related field of Pd-catalysed cross-coupling have been driven by ligand design, the development of ligands specifically for Ni has received minimal attention. Here, we disclose a class of phosphines that enable the Ni-catalysed Csp3 Suzuki coupling of acetals with boronic acids to generate benzylic ethers, a reaction that failed with known ligands for Ni and designer phosphines for Pd. Using parameters to quantify phosphine steric and electronic properties together with regression statistical analysis, we identify a model for ligand success. The study suggests that effective phosphines feature remote steric hindrance, a concept that could guide future ligand design tailored to Ni. Our analysis also reveals that two classic descriptors for ligand steric environment—cone angle and % buried volume—are not equivalent, despite their treatment in the literature. Ligand development underlies many advances in Pd-catalysed cross coupling but has seen limited application in the growing field of Ni catalysis. Now, a phosphine framework is shown to enable Ni-catalysed Suzuki coupling of acetals. Parameterization studies provide structural insight into ligand success and a quantitative model to facilitate further ligand design.

An ultrasensitive universal detector based on neutralizer displacement

Diagnostic technologies that can provide the simultaneous detection of nucleic acids for gene expression, proteins for host response and small molecules for profiling the human metabolome will have a significant advantage in providing comprehensive patient monitoring. Molecular sensors that report changes in the electrostatics of a sensor's surface on analyte binding have shown unprecedented sensitivity in the detection of charged biomolecules, but do not lend themselves to the detection of small molecules, which do not carry significant charge. Here, we introduce the neutralizer displacement assay that allows charge-based sensing to be applied to any class of molecule irrespective of the analyte charge. The neutralizer displacement assay starts with an aptamer probe bound to a neutralizer. When analyte binding occurs the neutralizer is displaced, which results in a dramatic change in the surface charge for all types of analytes. We have tested the sensitivity, speed and specificity of this system in the detection of a panel of molecules: (deoxy)ribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, cocaine, adenosine triphosphate and thrombin. A universal detector of small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids is described that relies on the displacement of a neutralizer molecule from a sensor surface. When the neutralizer is displaced by an analyte, an electrochemical signal is generated. Ultrasensitive limits of detection are achieved, and a new record for the electrochemical detection of bacteria (0.15 colony-forming units per microlitre) is reported.

Title: 
Selectivity and direct visualization of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide in a decorated porous host

Understanding the mechanism by which porous solids trap harmful gases such as CO2 and SO2 is essential for the design of new materials for their selective removal. Materials functionalized with amine groups dominate this field, largely because of their potential to form carbamates through H2N(δ−)···C(δ+)O2 interactions, thereby trapping CO2 covalently. However, the use of these materials is energy-intensive, with significant environmental impact. Here, we report a non-amine-containing porous solid (NOTT-300) in which hydroxyl groups within pores bind CO2 and SO2 selectively. In situ powder X-ray diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering studies, combined with modelling, reveal that hydroxyl groups bind CO2 and SO2 through the formation of O=C(S)=O(δ−)···H(δ+)–O hydrogen bonds, which are reinforced by weak supramolecular interactions with C–H atoms on the aromatic rings of the framework. This offers the potential for the application of new ‘easy-on/easy-off’ capture systems for CO2 and SO2 that carry fewer economic and environmental penalties. Porous solids are well suited to the capture of environmentally harmful gases, but further understanding of the solid–gas interactions involved is required. Combining dynamic and static characterization with modelling, researchers have now described how a metal–organic framework binds CO2 and SO2 selectively through hydroxyl groups — rather than amine ones as typically featured.

Title: 
Anionic silicate organic frameworks constructed from hexacoordinate silicon centres

Crystalline frameworks composed of hexacoordinate silicon species have thus far only been observed in a few high pressure silicate phases. By implementing reversible Si–O chemistry for the crystallization of covalent organic frameworks, we demonstrate the simple one-pot synthesis of silicate organic frameworks based on octahedral dianionic SiO6 building units. Clear evidence of the hexacoordinate environment around the silicon atoms is given by 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Characterization by high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction, density functional theory calculation and analysis of the pair-distribution function showed that those anionic frameworks—M2[Si(C16H10O4)1.5], where M = Li, Na, K and C16H10O4 is 9,10-dimethylanthracene-2,3,6,7-tetraolate—crystallize as two-dimensional hexagonal layers stabilized in a fully eclipsed stacking arrangement with pronounced disorder in the stacking direction. Permanent microporosity with high surface area (up to 1,276 m2 g−1) was evidenced by gas-sorption measurements. The negatively charged backbone balanced with extra-framework cations and the permanent microporosity are characteristics that are shared with zeolites. Hexacoordinate silicon is seen often in molecular compounds, but very rarely in crystalline silicate materials. Now, reversible Si–O chemistry has been used to assemble octahedral dianionic SiO6 building units and anthracene derivatives into crystalline microporous silicate organic frameworks that share characteristics of both covalent organic frameworks and inorganic zeolites.

Title: 
Dissociative electron attachment to CO2 produces molecular oxygen

Until recently, it was widely regarded that only one reaction pathway led to the production of molecular oxygen in Earth's prebiotic primitive atmosphere: a three-body recombination reaction of two oxygen atoms and a third body that removes excess energy. However, an additional pathway has recently been observed that involves the photodissociation of CO2 on exposure to ultraviolet light. Here we demonstrate a further pathway to O2 production, again from CO2, but via dissociative electron attachment (DEA). Using anion-velocity image mapping, we provide experimental evidence for a channel of DEA to CO2 that produces O2(X3Σ−g) + C−. This observed channel coexists in the same energy range as the competitive three-body dissociation of CO2 to give O + O + C−. The abundance of low-energy electrons in interstellar space and the upper atmosphere of Earth suggests that the contributions of these pathways are significant and should be incorporated into atmospheric chemistry models. Until recently, the three-body recombination reaction was widely regarded as the only reaction pathway to the production of molecular oxygen in Earth's prebiotic primitive atmosphere. Observation of a CO2 photodissociation pathway altered this view, but now, using anion velocity imaging, a further source of molecular oxygen is revealed, formed via the dissociative electron attachment to CO2.

Initiation of carbon nanotube growth by well-defined carbon nanorings

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), tubular molecular entities that consist of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, are currently produced as mixtures that contain tubes of various diameters and different sidewall structures. The electronic and optical properties of CNTs are determined by their diameters and sidewall structures and so a controlled synthesis of uniform-diameter, single-chirality CNTs—a significant chemical challenge—would provide access to pure samples with predictable properties. Here we report a rational bottom-up approach to synthesize structurally uniform CNTs using carbon nanorings (cycloparaphenylenes) as templates and ethanol as the carbon source. The average diameter of the CNTs formed is close to that of the carbon nanorings used, which supports the operation of a ‘growth-from-template’ mechanism in CNT formation. This bottom-up organic chemistry approach is intrinsically different from other conventional approaches to making CNTs and, if it can be optimized sufficiently, offers a route to the programmable synthesis of structurally uniform CNTs. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are typically produced as a mixture of tubes with different diameters and sidewall structures — parameters that determine the optical and electronic properties of these materials. Now, it has been shown that discrete carbon nanorings can be used as templates to control the bottom-up growth of CNTs with a narrow distribution of diameters.

Title: 
Rational design of functional and tunable oscillating enzymatic networks

Life is sustained by complex systems operating far from equilibrium and consisting of a multitude of enzymatic reaction networks. The operating principles of biology's regulatory networks are known, but the in vitro assembly of out-of-equilibrium enzymatic reaction networks has proved challenging, limiting the development of synthetic systems showing autonomous behaviour. Here, we present a strategy for the rational design of programmable functional reaction networks that exhibit dynamic behaviour. We demonstrate that a network built around autoactivation and delayed negative feedback of the enzyme trypsin is capable of producing sustained oscillating concentrations of active trypsin for over 65 h. Other functions, such as amplification, analog-to-digital conversion and periodic control over equilibrium systems, are obtained by linking multiple network modules in microfluidic flow reactors. The methodology developed here provides a general framework to construct dissipative, tunable and robust (bio)chemical reaction networks. In vitro assembly of out-of-equilibrium enzymatic reaction networks has proved challenging, limiting the development of autonomous synthetic systems. Now, a methodology has been developed to construct an enzymatic reaction network producing oscillations of active trypsin. The modular approach allows amplification or analog-to-digital conversion of the oscillations, and control over a self-assembly process.

Title: 
A new and selective cycle for dehydrogenation of linear and cyclic alkanes under mild conditions using a base metal

Selectively converting linear alkanes to α-olefins under mild conditions is a highly desirable transformation given the abundance of alkanes as well as the use of olefins as building blocks in the chemical community. Until now, this reaction has been primarily the remit of noble-metal catalysts, despite extensive work showing that base-metal alkylidenes can mediate the reaction in a stoichiometric fashion. Here, we show how the presence of a hydrogen acceptor, such as the phosphorus ylide, when combined with the alkylidene complex (PNP)Ti=CHtBu(CH3) (PNP=N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2−), catalyses the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes to cyclic alkenes, and linear alkanes with chain lengths of C4 to C8 to terminal olefins under mild conditions. This Article represents the first example of a homogeneous and selective alkane dehydrogenation reaction using a base-metal titanium catalyst. We also propose a unique mechanism for the transfer dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons to olefins and discuss a complete cycle based on a combined experimental and computational study. The direct, selective conversion of linear alkanes to α-olefins — without isomerization — is an important reaction in the field of catalysis from both a fundamental and industrial perspective. Now, a detailed pathway has been described for how a base metal can promote such a reaction with several turnovers, in a non-oxidative set of C–H activation reactions, thus preventing olefin isomerization.

Title: 
Multidimensional steric parameters in the analysis of asymmetric catalytic reactions

Although asymmetric catalysis is universally dependent on spatial interactions to impart specific chirality on a given substrate, examination of steric effects in these catalytic systems remains empirical. Previous efforts by our group and others have seen correlation between steric parameters developed by Charton and simple substituents in both substrate and ligand; however, more complex substituents were not found to be correlative. Here, we review and compare the steric parameters common in quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR), a common method for pharmaceutical function optimization, and how they might be applied in asymmetric catalysis, as the two fields are undeniably similar. We re-evaluate steric/enantioselection relationships, which we previously analysed with Charton steric parameters, using the more sophisticated Sterimol parameters developed by Verloop and co-workers in a QSAR context. Use of these Sterimol parameters led to strong correlations in numerous processes where Charton parameters had previously failed. Sterimol parameterization also allows for greater mechanistic insight into the key elements of asymmetric induction within these systems. Many parameters have been designed to describe steric size, but few have been able to explain consistently the selectivity of asymmetric catalytic reactions. Here, Sterimol parameters — originally used to develop quantitative structure–activity relationships in medicinal chemistry — have been used to quantify enantioselectivity in a diverse collection of asymmetric catalytic reactions.

Engineering live cell surfaces with functional polymers via cytocompatible controlled radical polymerization

The capability to graft synthetic polymers onto the surfaces of live cells offers the potential to manipulate and control their phenotype and underlying cellular processes. Conventional grafting-to strategies for conjugating preformed polymers to cell surfaces are limited by low polymer grafting efficiency. Here we report an alternative grafting-from strategy for directly engineering the surfaces of live yeast and mammalian cells through cell surface-initiated controlled radical polymerization. By developing cytocompatible PET-RAFT (photoinduced electron transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization), synthetic polymers with narrow polydispersity (Mw/Mn &lt; 1.3) could be obtained at room temperature in 5 minutes. This polymerization strategy enables chain growth to be initiated directly from chain-transfer agents anchored on the surface of live cells using either covalent attachment or non-covalent insertion, while maintaining high cell viability. Compared with conventional grafting-to approaches, these methods significantly improve the efficiency of grafting polymer chains and enable the active manipulation of cellular phenotypes. A cytocompatible controlled radical polymerization method has now been developed that initiates polymer synthesis directly on the surface of living cells. This method achieves significantly enhanced polymer grafting and enables active manipulation of cellular phenotypes.

Title: 
Chemistry inside molecular containers in the gas phase

Inner-phase chemical reactions of guest molecules encapsulated in a macromolecular cavity give fundamental insight into the relative stabilization of transition states by the surrounding walls of the host, thereby modelling the situation of substrates in enzymatic binding pockets. Although in solution several examples of inner-phase reactions are known, the use of cucurbiturils as macrocyclic hosts and bicyclic azoalkanes as guests has now enabled a systematic mass spectrometric investigation of inner-phase reactions in the gas phase, where typically the supply of thermal energy results in dissociation of the supramolecular host–guest assembly. The results reveal a sensitive interplay in which attractive and repulsive van der Waals interactions between the differently sized hosts and guests need to be balanced with a constrictive binding to allow thermally activated chemical reactions to compete with dissociation. The results are important for the understanding of supramolecular reactivity and have implications for catalysis. Reactions that occur inside macrocyclic hosts have been studied extensively in solution. Such inner-phase reactions have now been investigated in the gas phase using cucurbituril hosts and bicyclic azoalkane guests. Distinct structure–reactivity relationships have been identified, in which not only is the intrinsic activation energy critical, but also the degree of constrictive binding and the size of the void reaction space.

Structure and reactivity of a mononuclear gold(II) complex

Mononuclear gold(II) complexes are very rare labile species. Transient gold(II) species have been suggested in homogeneous catalysis and in medical applications, but their geometric and electronic structures have remained essentially unexplored: even fundamental data, such as the ionic radius of gold(II), are unknown. Now, an unprecedentedly stable neutral gold(II) complex of a porphyrin derivative has been isolated, and its structural and spectroscopic features determined. The gold atom adopts a 2+2 coordination mode in between those of gold(III) (four-coordinate square planar) and gold(I) (two-coordinate linear), owing to a second-order Jahn–Teller distortion enabled by the relativistically lowered 6s orbital of gold. The reactivity of this gold(II) complex towards dioxygen, nitrosobenzene and acids is discussed. This study provides insight on the ionic radius of gold(II), and allows it to be placed within the homologous series of nd9 Cu/Ag/Au divalent ions and the 5d8/9/10 Pt/Au/Hg ‘relativistic’ triad in the periodic table. Mononuclear gold(II) complexes are very labile (and thus very rare) species. Now, a gold(II) porphyrin complex has been isolated and characterized, and its reactivity towards dioxygen, nitrosobenzene and acids investigated. Owing to a second-order Jahn–Teller distortion, the gold atoms were found to adopt a 2+2 coordination mode in a planar N4 environment.

Large-scale screening of hypothetical metal–organic frameworks

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials constructed from modular molecular building blocks, typically metal clusters and organic linkers. These can, in principle, be assembled to form an almost unlimited number of MOFs, yet materials reported to date represent only a tiny fraction of the possible combinations. Here, we demonstrate a computational approach to generate all conceivable MOFs from a given chemical library of building blocks (based on the structures of known MOFs) and rapidly screen them to find the best candidates for a specific application. From a library of 102 building blocks we generated 137,953 hypothetical MOFs and for each one calculated the pore-size distribution, surface area and methane-storage capacity. We identified over 300 MOFs with a predicted methane-storage capacity better than that of any known material, and this approach also revealed structure–property relationships. Methyl-functionalized MOFs were frequently top performers, so we selected one such promising MOF and experimentally confirmed its predicted capacity. Chemists are able to prepare a wide variety of metal–organic frameworks by connecting together inorganic and organic building blocks of all sorts of shapes and properties. Now, a large-scale computational screening approach that simulates thousands of hypothetical MOFs from previously synthesized ones can help identify just which materials should be pursued.

Nickel-catalysed Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of amides

The Suzuki–Miyaura coupling has become one of the most important and prevalent methods for the construction of C–C bonds. Although palladium catalysis has historically dominated the field, the use of nickel catalysis has become increasingly widespread because of its unique ability to cleave carbon–heteroatom bonds that are unreactive towards other transition metals. We report the first nickel-catalysed Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of amides, which proceeds by an uncommon cleavage of the amide C–N bond after N-tert-butoxycarbonyl activation. The methodology is mild, functional-group tolerant and can be strategically employed in sequential transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling sequences to unite heterocyclic fragments. These studies demonstrate that amides, despite classically considered inert substrates, can be harnessed as synthons for use in reactions that form C–C bonds through cleavage of the C–N bond using non-precious metal catalysis. Amides have historically been considered stable and unreactive functional groups because of resonance stabilization. Here, it is demonstrated that Boc-activated amides can be employed in Suzuki–Miyaura couplings using non-precious-metal catalysis. The overall reaction is complementary to the widely employed Weinreb ketone synthesis.

Mass spectrometry captures off-target drug binding and provides mechanistic insights into the human metalloprotease ZMPSTE24

Off-target binding of hydrophobic drugs can lead to unwanted side effects, either through specific or non-specific binding to unintended membrane protein targets. However, distinguishing the binding of drugs to membrane proteins from that of detergents, lipids and cofactors is challenging. Here, we use high-resolution mass spectrometry to study the effects of HIV protease inhibitors on the human zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24. This intramembrane protease plays a major role in converting prelamin A to mature lamin A. We monitored the proteolysis of farnesylated prelamin A peptide by ZMPSTE24 and unexpectedly found retention of the C-terminal peptide product with the enzyme. We also resolved binding of zinc, lipids and HIV protease inhibitors and showed that drug binding blocked prelamin A peptide cleavage and conferred stability to ZMPSTE24. Our results not only have relevance for the progeria-like side effects of certain HIV protease inhibitor drugs, but also highlight new approaches for documenting off-target drug binding. Off-target drug binding of anti-HIV protease inhibitors to a zinc metalloprotease has been suspected for some time. Now, mass spectrometry of human zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 in the presence of four inhibitors has provided molecular evidence for this off-target binding. These results also enabled an investigation of the effects of the inhibitors on the processing of farnesylated prelamin A peptides.

The critical role of phase-transfer catalysis in aprotic sodium oxygen batteries

In the search for improved energy storage, rechargeable metal–oxygen batteries are very attractive owing to their reliance on molecular oxygen, which forms oxides on discharge that decompose reversibly on charge. Much focus has been directed at aprotic Li–O2 cells, but the aprotic Na–O2 system is of equal interest because of its better reversibility. We report here on the critical role and mechanism of phase-transfer catalysis in Na–O2 batteries. We find that it is solely responsible for the growth and dissolution of micrometre-sized cubic NaO2 crystals and for the reversible cell capacity. In the absence of phase-transfer catalysis, quasi-amorphous NaO2 films are formed and cells exhibit negligible capacity. Electrochemical investigations provide a measure of the transportation of superoxide from the carbon electrode to the electrolyte phase by the phase transfer catalyst. This leads to a new understanding of the mechanism of Na–O2 batteries that, significantly, extends to Li–O2 cells and explains their different behaviour. Better understanding of the chemistry of rechargeable metal–oxygen batteries is needed to fulfil their potential. It is now shown that proton phase-transfer catalysts drive Na–O2 batteries, transporting superoxide between the electrode surface and the electrolyte as HO2. The chemistry uncovered gives rise to the system's high reversible capacity.

Rational design of reversible fluorescent probes for live-cell imaging and quantification of fast glutathione dynamics

Alterations in glutathione (GSH) homeostasis are associated with a variety of diseases and cellular functions, and therefore, real-time live-cell imaging and quantification of GSH dynamics are important for understanding pathophysiological processes. However, existing fluorescent probes are unsuitable for these purposes due to their irreversible fluorogenic mechanisms or slow reaction rates. In this work, we have successfully overcome these problems by establishing a design strategy inspired by Mayr's work on nucleophilic reaction kinetics. The synthesized probes exhibit concentration-dependent, reversible and rapid absorption/fluorescence changes (t1/2 = 620 ms at [GSH] = 1 mM), as well as appropriate Kd values (1–10 mM: within the range of intracellular GSH concentrations). We also developed FRET-based ratiometric probes, and demonstrated that they are useful for quantifying GSH concentration in various cell types and also for real-time live-cell imaging of GSH dynamics with temporal resolution of seconds. Reversible fluorescent probes for intracellular glutathione (GSH) imaging have now been designed and synthesized based on Si-rhodamine fluorophores. These probes are shown to be capable of quantifying the GSH concentration in various living cell types and also for monitoring real-time live-cell imaging of GSH dynamics with a temporal resolution of seconds.

Sub-50-fs photoinduced spin crossover in [Fe(bpy)3]2+

It is known that excitation by visible light of the singlet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (1MLCT) states of Fe(II) complexes leads to population of the lowest-lying high-spin quintet state (5T) with unity quantum yield. Here we investigate this so-called spin crossover (SCO) transition in aqueous iron(II)tris(bipyridine). We use pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy with a high time resolution of &lt;60 fs in the ultraviolet probe range, in which the 5T state absorbs, and of &lt;40 fs in the visible probe range, in which both the hot MLCT state and the 5T state absorb. Our results show that the 5T state is impulsively populated in less than 50 fs, which is the time we measured for the depopulation of the MCLT manifold. We propose that non-totally-symmetric modes mediate the process, possibly high-frequency modes of the bipyridine (bpy) ligand. These results show that even though the SCO process in Fe(II) complexes represents a strongly spin-forbidden (ΔS = 2) two-electron transition, spin flipping occurs at near subvibrational times and is intertwined with the electron and structural dynamics of the system. Fe(II) complexes display transitions between spin states that can be triggered externally. Now the light-induced ΔS = 2 transition upon excitation of the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer states of Fe(II)-polypyridine complexes has been investigated at high time-resolution in the visible and the ultraviolet range. It has been shown to occur in less than 50 fs — that is, on a sub-vibrational timescale.

Self-healing chemistry enables the stable operation of silicon microparticle anodes for high-energy lithium-ion batteries

The ability to repair damage spontaneously, which is termed self-healing, is an important survival feature in nature because it increases the lifetime of most living creatures. This feature is highly desirable for rechargeable batteries because the lifetime of high-capacity electrodes, such as silicon anodes, is shortened by mechanical fractures generated during the cycling process. Here, inspired by nature, we apply self-healing chemistry to silicon microparticle (SiMP) anodes to overcome their short cycle-life. We show that anodes made from low-cost SiMPs (~3–8&nbsp;µm), for which stable deep galvanostatic cycling was previously impossible, can now have an excellent cycle life when coated with a self-healing polymer. We attain a cycle life ten times longer than state-of-art anodes made from SiMPs and still retain a high capacity (up to ~3,000&nbsp;mA h g−1). Cracks and damage in the coating during cycling can be healed spontaneously by the randomly branched hydrogen-bonding polymer used. The ability to self-heal is an important survival feature in nature, with in-built systems working to correct faults and extend the lifetimes of organisms. Now, self-healing chemistry has been applied to overcome the short cycling lifetime of high-capacity rechargeable lithium-ion batteries with silicon-microparticle anodes that suffer from mechanical fractures.

Carbon dioxide transport in molten calcium carbonate occurs through an oxo-Grotthuss mechanism via a pyrocarbonate anion

The reactivity, speciation and solvation structure of CO2 in carbonate melts are relevant for both the fate of carbon in deep geological formations and for its electroreduction to CO (to be used as fuel) when solvated in a molten carbonate electrolyte. In particular, the high solubility of CO2 in carbonate melts has been tentatively attributed to the formation of the pyrocarbonate anion, C2O52–. Here we study, by first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, the behaviour of CO2 in molten calcium carbonate. We find that pyrocarbonate forms spontaneously and the identity of the CO2 molecule is quickly lost through O2– exchange. The transport of CO2 in this molten carbonate thus occurs in a fashion similar to the Grotthuss mechanism in water, and is three times faster than molecular diffusion. This shows that Grotthuss-like transport is more general than previously thought. The solvation behaviour of CO2 in carbonate melts is important from both a geochemical point of view and with respect to its electroreduction. Now, simulations have shown that solvation of CO2 in molten CaCO3 leads to the formation of the pyrocarbonate anion, C2O52–, which significantly enhances the transport of CO2 via a Grotthuss-like mechanism.

Highly emissive platinum(II) metallacages

Light-emitting materials, especially those with tunable wavelengths, attract considerable attention for applications in optoelectronic devices, fluorescent probes, sensors and so on. Many species evaluated for these purposes either emit as a dilute solution or on aggregation, with the former often self-quenching at high concentrations, and the latter falling dark when aggregation is disrupted. Here we preserve emissive behaviour at both low- and high-concentration regimes for two discrete supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs). These tetragonal prismatic SCCs are self-assembled on mixing a metal acceptor, Pt(PEt3)2(OSO2CF3)2, with two organic donors, a pyridyl-decorated tetraphenylethylene and one of two benzene dicarboxylate species. The rigid organization of these fluorescence-active ligands imparts an emissive behaviour to dilute solutions of the resulting assemblies. Furthermore, on aggregation the prisms exhibit variable-wavelength visible-light emission, including rare white-light emission in tetrahydrofuran. The favourable photophysical properties and solvent-dependent aggregation behaviour provide a means to tune emission wavelengths. Two metallacages containing Pt(II) phosphine centres bridged by organic donors are shown to display dynamic emission behaviour across a range of concentrations. At low concentrations, the individual cages emit. At high concentrations, or on introduction of additional solvents, aggregation occurs that manifests in colour-tunable fluorescence and white-light emission in THF.

Mechanism-based enhancement of scope and enantioselectivity for reactions involving a copper-substituted stereogenic carbon centre

A rapidly emerging set of catalytic reactions involves intermediates that contain a copper-substituted stereogenic carbon centre. Here, we demonstrate that an intimate understanding of this distinction provides ways for addressing limitations in reaction scope and explaining why unexpected variations in enantioselectivity often occur. By using catalytic enantioselective Cu–boryl addition to alkenes as the model process, we elucidate several key mechanistic principles. We show that higher electrophile concentration can lead to elevated enantioselectivity. This is because diastereoselective Cu–H elimination may be avoided and/or achiral Cu–boryl intermediates can be converted to allyl–B(pin) rather than add to an alkene. We illustrate that lower alkene amounts and/or higher chiral ligand concentration can minimize the deleterious influence of achiral Cu–alkyl species, resulting in improved enantiomeric ratios. Moreover, and surprisingly, we find that enantioselectivities are higher with the less reactive allylphenyl carbonates as chemoselective copper–hydride elimination is faster with an achiral Cu-alkyl species. Although organocopper compounds are well known in organic chemistry, only recently has a set of catalytic reactions emerged that involve intermediates containing a copper-substituted stereogenic carbon centre. Now, a mechanistic study demonstrates that a better understanding of this distinction offers ways to address significant limitations in scope and enantioselectivity, explaining why unexpected variations in selectivity can occur.

Discovering chemistry with an ab initio nanoreactor

Chemical understanding is driven by the experimental discovery of new compounds and reactivity, and is supported by theory and computation that provide detailed physical insight. Although theoretical and computational studies have generally focused on specific processes or mechanistic hypotheses, recent methodological and computational advances harken the advent of their principal role in discovery. Here we report the development and application of the ab initio nanoreactor—a highly accelerated first-principles molecular dynamics simulation of chemical reactions that discovers new molecules and mechanisms without preordained reaction coordinates or elementary steps. Using the nanoreactor, we show new pathways for glycine synthesis from primitive compounds proposed to exist on the early Earth, which provide new insight into the classic Urey–Miller experiment. These results highlight the emergence of theoretical and computational chemistry as a tool for discovery, in addition to its traditional role of interpreting experimental findings. Computational chemistry is traditionally used to interpret experimental findings. Now its use in reaction discovery is described with the development of the ab initio nanoreactor — a highly accelerated, first-principles molecular dynamics simulation of chemical reactions that discovers new molecules and mechanisms without preordained reaction coordinates or elementary steps.

Functional carbon nanosheets prepared from hexayne amphiphile monolayers at room temperature

Carbon nanostructures that feature two-dimensional extended nanosheets are important components for technological applications such as high-performance composites, lithium-ion storage, photovoltaics and nanoelectronics. Chemical functionalization would render such structures better processable and more suited for tailored applications, but typically this is precluded by the high temperatures needed to prepare the nanosheets. Here, we report direct access to functional carbon nanosheets of uniform thickness at room temperature. We used amphiphiles that contain hexayne segments as metastable carbon precursors and self-assembled these into ordered monolayers at the air/water interface. Subsequent carbonization by ultraviolet irradiation in ambient conditions resulted in the quantitative carbonization of the hexayne sublayer. Carbon nanosheets prepared in this way retained their surface functionalization and featured an sp2-rich amorphous carbon structure comparable to that usually obtained on annealing above 800&nbsp;°C. Moreover, they exhibited a molecularly defined thickness of 1.9&nbsp;nm, were mechanically self-supporting over several micrometres and had macroscopic lateral dimensions on the order of centimetres. Carbonization of a self-assembled monolayer of a hexayne amphiphile at the air/water interface at room temperature results in the formation of functional carbon nanosheets. The nanosheets exhibit a molecularly defined thickness, are mechanically self-supporting over several micrometres, and have macroscopic lateral dimensions on the order of centimetres.

Quantifying the chemical beauty of drugs

Drug-likeness is a key consideration when selecting compounds during the early stages of drug discovery. However, evaluation of drug-likeness in absolute terms does not reflect adequately the whole spectrum of compound quality. More worryingly, widely used rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular property inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant compounds towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of drug-likeness based on the concept of desirability called the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). The empirical rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of molecular properties. QED is intuitive, transparent, straightforward to implement in many practical settings and allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of molecular target druggability assessment by prioritizing a large set of published bioactive compounds. The measure may also capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in medicinal chemistry. Drug-likeness is a key consideration when selecting compounds during the early stages of drug discovery, but its evaluation in absolute terms does not adequately reflect the spectrum of compound quality. Here, an intuitive and transparent quantitative measure of drug-likeness is proposed that attempts to capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in medicinal chemistry.

Electron transfer through rigid organic molecular wires enhanced by electronic and electron–vibration coupling

Electron transfer (ET) is a fundamental process in a wide range of biological systems, photovoltaics and molecular electronics. Therefore to understand the relationship between molecular structure and ET properties is of prime importance. For this purpose, photoinduced ET has been studied extensively using donor–bridge–acceptor molecules, in which π-conjugated molecular wires are employed as bridges. Here, we demonstrate that carbon-bridged oligo-p-phenylenevinylene (COPV), which is both rigid and flat, shows an 840-fold increase in the ET rate compared with the equivalent flexible molecular bridges. A 120-fold rate enhancement is explained in terms of enhanced electronic coupling between the electron donor and the electron acceptor because of effective conjugation through the COPVs. The remainder of the rate enhancement is explained by inelastic electron tunnelling through COPV caused by electron–vibration coupling, unprecedented for organic molecular wires in solution at room temperature. This type of nonlinear effect demonstrates the versatility and potential practical utility of COPVs in molecular device applications. The relationship between electron-transfer properties and the structure of molecular electronics is still not fully understood. Now, a rigid and flat molecular wire has been shown to significantly enhance the rate of electron transfer compared with conventional flexible molecular wires. This enhancement is attributable to both conjugation-induced electronic coupling and inelastic electron tunnelling-enabled electron–vibration coupling.

Biosynthetic consequences of multiple sequential post-transition-state bifurcations

Selectivity in chemical reactions that form complex molecular architectures from simpler precursors is usually rationalized by comparing competing transition-state structures that lead to different possible products. Herein we describe a system for which a single transition-state structure leads to the formation of many isomeric products via pathways that feature multiple sequential bifurcations. The reaction network described connects the pimar-15-en-8-yl cation to miltiradiene, a tricyclic diterpene natural product, and isomers via cyclizations and/or rearrangements. The results suggest that the selectivity of the reaction is controlled by (post-transition-state) dynamic effects, that is, how the carbocation structure changes in response to the distribution of energy in its vibrational modes. The inherent dynamical effects revealed herein (characterized through quasiclassical direct dynamics calculations using density functional theory) have implications not only for the general principles of selectivity prediction in systems with complex potential energy surfaces, but also for the mechanisms of terpene synthase enzymes and their evolution. These findings redefine the challenges faced by nature in controlling the biosynthesis of complex natural products. A terpene-forming carbocation reaction is described for which a single transition-state structure leads to the formation of many isomeric products via pathways that feature multiple sequential bifurcations. Dynamic effects are shown to contribute to the selectivity of the reaction, with consequences for how enzymes control the biosynthesis of complex natural products.

Selective transformations of complex molecules are enabled by aptameric protective groups

Emerging trends in drug discovery are prompting a renewed interest in natural products as a source of chemical diversity and lead structures. However, owing to the structural complexity of many natural compounds, the synthesis of derivatives is not easily realized. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new approach using oligonucleotides as aptameric protective groups. These block several functionalities by non-covalent interactions in a complex molecule and enable the highly chemo- and regioselective derivatization (&gt;99%) of natural antibiotics in a single synthetic step with excellent conversions of up to 83%. This technique reveals an important structure–activity relationship in neamine-based antibiotics and should help both to accelerate the discovery of new biologically active structures and to avoid potentially costly and cumbersome synthetic routes. Selective modifications of structurally complex molecules bearing multiple reactive functional groups often require cumbersome multistep synthetic efforts. Here, aptameric protective groups based on short RNA sequences are described — they bind to neamine antibiotics, simultaneously protecting several functionalities and enabling regio- and chemoselective functionalizations.

A grossly warped nanographene and the consequences of multiple odd-membered-ring defects

Graphite, the most stable form of elemental carbon, consists of pure carbon sheets stacked upon one another like reams of paper. Individual sheets, known as graphene, prefer planar geometries as a consequence of the hexagonal honeycomb-like arrangements of trigonal carbon atoms that comprise their two-dimensional networks. Defects in the form of non-hexagonal rings in such networks cause distortions away from planarity. Herein we report an extreme example of this phenomenon. A 26-ring C80H30 nanographene that incorporates five seven-membered rings and one five-membered ring embedded in a hexagonal lattice was synthesized by stepwise chemical methods, isolated, purified and fully characterized spectroscopically. Its grossly warped structure was revealed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. An independent synthetic route to a freely soluble derivative of this new type of ‘nanocarbon’ is also reported. Experimental data reveal how the properties of such a large graphene subunit are affected by multiple odd-membered-ring defects. A grossly warped nanographene, C80H30, that incorporates five 7-membered rings and one 5-membered ring embedded in a hexagonal lattice has been synthesized, isolated and fully characterized. Experiments revealing how the properties of such a large graphene subunit are affected by multiple odd-membered-ring defects are also reported.

Stable, crystalline, porous, covalent organic frameworks as a platform for chiral organocatalysts

The periodic layers and ordered nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) make these materials viable open catalytic nanoreactors, but their low stability has precluded their practical implementation. Here we report the synthesis of a crystalline porous COF that is stable against water, strong acids and strong bases, and we demonstrate its utility as a material platform for structural design and functional development. We endowed a crystalline and porous imine-based COF with stability by incorporating methoxy groups into its pore walls to reinforce interlayer interactions. We subsequently converted the resulting achiral material into two distinct chiral organocatalysts, with the high crystallinity and porosity retained, by appending chiral centres and catalytically active sites on its channel walls. The COFs thus prepared combine catalytic activity, enantioselectivity and recyclability, which are attractive in heterogeneous organocatalysis, and were shown to promote asymmetric C–C bond formation in water under ambient conditions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) feature periodic layers and ordered pores that make them promising for applications in catalysis, but they typically suffer from poor stability. Now, adding methoxy groups to its pore walls has been shown to strengthen a COF's interlayer interactions, resulting in a stable, crystalline, porous material that can be further converted into chiral organocatalysts.

Title: 
An organic thiyl radical catalyst for enantioselective cyclization

A diverse array of chiral organocatalysts have been developed that rely on acid–base interactions to promote enantioselective ionic reactions via the movement of electron pairs. The stereocontrol of radical reactions using organocatalysts is an alternative approach, and several studies have shown that synthetically useful reactivity can result by controlling the movement of single electrons. However, in these studies, it is still an acid–based organocatalyst which forms a closed-shell intermediate with substrate prior to the radical reaction and imparts chiral information, and use of a chiral organic radical directly as catalyst has only rarely been explored. Here, we report the design of an organic thiyl radical catalyst with a carefully designed chiral pocket constructed around a chiral thiol precatalyst. The resulting catalyst was used to effect highly diastereo- and enantioselective C–C bond-forming radical cyclizations. The ability of thiyl radicals to promote reactions has been known for decades although its extension to asymmetric catalysis has only rarely been explored. Now, an organic thiyl radical catalyst with a carefully structured chiral pocket has been designed as a means to achieve highly enantioselective radical cyclizations.

Optical control of antibacterial activity

Bacterial resistance is a major problem in the modern world, stemming in part from the build-up of antibiotics in the environment. Novel molecular approaches that enable an externally triggered increase in antibiotic activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and auto-inactivation are highly desirable. Here we report a responsive, broad-spectrum, antibacterial agent that can be temporally activated with light, whereupon it auto-inactivates on the scale of hours. The use of such a ‘smart’ antibiotic might prevent the build-up of active antimicrobial material in the environment. Reversible optical control over active drug concentration enables us to obtain pharmacodynamic information. Precisely localized control of activity is achieved, allowing the growth of bacteria to be confined to defined patterns, which has potential for the development of treatments that avoid interference with the endogenous microbial population in other parts of the organism.&nbsp; Avoiding the development of microbial antibiotic resistance is a major challenge. Now the incorporation of a photoswitchable group into quinolones has been used to create ‘smart’ antibiotics that can be activated with light. The subsequent loss of activity (within hours) should prevent the build-up of active antibiotics in the environment.

Title: 
Biosynthesis of the tunicamycin antibiotics proceeds via unique exo-glycal intermediates

The tunicamycins are archetypal nucleoside antibiotics targeting bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis and eukaryotic protein N-glycosylation. Understanding the biosynthesis of their unusual carbon framework may lead to variants with improved selectivity. Here, we demonstrate in vitro recapitulation of key sugar-manipulating enzymes from this pathway. TunA is found to exhibit unusual regioselectivity in the reduction of a key α,β-unsaturated ketone. The product of this reaction is shown to be the preferred substrate for TunF—an epimerase that converts the glucose derivative to a galactose. In Streptomyces strains in which another gene (tunB) is deleted, the biosynthesis is shown to stall at this exo-glycal product. These investigations confirm the combined TunA/F activity and delineate the ordering of events in the metabolic pathway. This is the first time these surprising exo-glycal intermediates have been seen in biology. They suggest that construction of the aminodialdose core of tunicamycin exploits their enol ether motif in a mode of C–C bond formation not previously observed in nature, to create an 11-carbon chain. Construction of the remarkable 11-carbon frame of the antibiotic tunicamycin is shown to use cyclic enol ethers (exo-glycals) — the first time such intermediates have been seen in biology. Exo-glycal synthase TunA uses an elegantly subtle mechanism to control regioselectivity and with exo-glycal epimerase TunF sets a logical chemical stage for downstream radical C–C coupling.

Title: 
Efficient room-temperature synthesis of a highly strained carbon nanohoop fragment of buckminsterfullerene

Warped carbon-rich molecules have captured the imagination of scientists across many disciplines. Owing to their promising materials properties and challenging synthesis, strained hydrocarbons are attractive targets that push the limits of synthetic methods and molecular design. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of [5]cycloparaphenylene ([5]CPP), a carbon nanohoop that can be envisaged as an open tubular fragment of C60, the equator of C70 fullerene and the unit cycle of a [5,5] armchair carbon nanotube. Given its calculated 119&nbsp;kcal&nbsp;mol−1 strain energy and severely distorted benzene rings, this synthesis, which employs a room-temperature macrocyclization of a diboronate precursor, single-electron reduction and elimination, is remarkably mild and high yielding (27% over three steps). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were obtained to confirm its geometry and previously disputed benzenoid character. First and second pseudoreversible oxidation and reduction events were observed via cyclic voltammetry. The ease of synthesis, high solubility and narrowest optical HOMO/LUMO gap of any para-polyphenylene synthesized make [5]CPP a desirable new material for organic electronics. Strained hydrocarbons are more than molecular curiosities — they often have promising materials properties, and even just making them offers challenges that push the limits of synthetic methods. Now, a short, efficient and room-temperature synthesis of [5]cycloparaphenylene, a carbon nanohoop with 119&nbsp;kcal&nbsp;per&nbsp;mol of strain energy, is reported.

Organometallic neptunium(III) complexes

Studies of transuranic organometallic complexes provide a particularly valuable insight into covalent contributions to the metal–ligand bonding, in which the subtle differences between the transuranium actinide ions and their lighter lanthanide counterparts are of fundamental importance for the effective remediation of nuclear waste. Unlike the organometallic chemistry of uranium, which has focused strongly on UIII and has seen some spectacular advances, that of the transuranics is significantly technically more challenging and has remained dormant. In the case of neptunium, it is limited mainly to NpIV. Here we report the synthesis of three new NpIII organometallic compounds and the characterization of their molecular and electronic structures. These studies suggest that NpIII complexes could act as single-molecule magnets, and that the lower oxidation state of NpII is chemically accessible. In comparison with lanthanide analogues, significant d- and f-electron contributions to key NpIII orbitals are observed, which shows that fundamental neptunium organometallic chemistry can provide new insights into the behaviour of f-elements. Probing the chemistry of transuranic elements is notoriously challenging. Now, three neptunium(III) organometallic sandwich complexes have been prepared using a flexible macrocycle as ligand, and their molecular and electronic structures characterized, adding to our understanding of the behaviour of f-elements and suggesting that the lower oxidation state Np(II) may be chemically accessible.

Transfer of molecular recognition information from DNA nanostructures to gold nanoparticles

DNA nanotechnology offers unparalleled precision and programmability for the bottom-up organization of materials. This approach relies on pre-assembling a DNA scaffold, typically containing hundreds of different strands, and using it to position functional components. A particularly attractive strategy is to employ DNA nanostructures not as permanent scaffolds, but as transient, reusable templates to transfer essential information to other materials. To our knowledge, this approach, akin to top-down lithography, has not been examined. Here we report a molecular printing strategy that chemically transfers a discrete pattern of DNA strands from a three-dimensional DNA structure to a gold nanoparticle. We show that the particles inherit the DNA sequence configuration encoded in the parent template with high fidelity. This provides control over the number of DNA strands and their relative placement, directionality and sequence asymmetry. Importantly, the nanoparticles produced exhibit the site-specific addressability of DNA nanostructures, and are promising components for energy, information and biomedical applications. DNA nanostructures are typically used as molecular scaffolds. Now, it has been shown that they can also act as reusable templates for ‘molecular printing’ of DNA strands onto gold nanoparticles. The products inherit the recognition elements of the parent template: number, orientation and sequence asymmetry of DNA strands. This converts isotropic nanoparticles into complex building blocks.

Title: 
Dynamics of the triplet-pair state reveals the likely coexistence of coherent and incoherent singlet fission in crystalline hexacene

The absorption of a photon usually creates a singlet exciton (S1) in molecular systems, but in some cases S1 may split into two triplets (2×T1) in a process called singlet fission. Singlet fission is believed to proceed through the correlated triplet-pair 1(TT) state. Here, we probe the 1(TT) state in crystalline hexacene using time-resolved photoemission and transient absorption spectroscopies. We find a distinctive 1(TT) state, which decays to 2×T1 with a time constant of 270 fs. However, the decay of S1 and the formation of 1(TT) occur on different timescales of 180 fs and &lt;50 fs, respectively. Theoretical analysis suggests that, in addition to an incoherent S1→1(TT) rate process responsible for the 180 fs timescale, S1 may couple coherently to a vibronically excited 1(TT) on ultrafast timescales (&lt;50 fs). The coexistence of coherent and incoherent singlet fission may also reconcile different experimental observations in other acenes. Singlet fission — the splitting of a singlet exciton into two triplets — is a process that could be exploited to improve the power conversion efficiency of solar cells. Spectroscopic data now suggest that coherent and incoherent mechanisms for singlet fission in crystalline hexacene coexist and occur on different timescales.

Snapshot of the equilibrium dynamics of a drug bound to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase

The anti-AIDS drug rilpivirine undergoes conformational changes to bind HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), which is an essential enzyme for the replication of HIV. These changes allow it to retain potency against mutations that otherwise would render the enzyme resistant. Here we report that water molecules play an essential role in this binding process. Femtosecond experiments and theory expose the molecular level dynamics of rilpivirine bound to HIV-1 RT. Two nitrile substituents, one on each arm of the drug, are used as vibrational probes of the structural dynamics within the binding pocket. Two-dimensional vibrational echo spectroscopy reveals that one nitrile group is unexpectedly hydrogen-bonded to a mobile water molecule, not identified in previous X-ray structures. Ultrafast nitrile–water dynamics are confirmed by simulations. A higher (1.51&nbsp;Å) resolution X-ray structure also reveals a water–drug interaction network. Maintenance of a crucial anchoring hydrogen bond may help retain the potency of rilpivirine against pocket mutations despite the structural variations they cause. Conformational changes are known to occur during binding of the anti-AIDS drug rilpivirine to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, an essential enzyme for the replication of HIV. Vibrational spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and simulations now show that water molecules play an essential role in this binding process, which may help it retain potency despite mutations within the binding pocket.

Redox-controlled potassium intercalation into two polyaromatic hydrocarbon solids

Alkali metal intercalation into polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been studied intensely after reports of superconductivity in a number of potassium- and rubidium-intercalated materials. There are, however, no reported crystal structures to inform our understanding of the chemistry and physics because of the complex reactivity of PAHs with strong reducing agents at high temperature. Here we present the synthesis of crystalline K2Pentacene and K2Picene by a solid–solid insertion protocol that uses potassium hydride as a redox-controlled reducing agent to access the PAH dianions, and so enables the determination of their crystal structures. In both cases, the inserted cations expand the parent herringbone packings by reorienting the molecular anions to create multiple potassium sites within initially dense molecular layers, and thus interact with the PAH anion π systems. The synthetic and crystal chemistry of alkali metal intercalation into PAHs differs from that into fullerenes and graphite, in which the cation sites are pre-defined by the host structure. Reports of superconductivity in KxPicene spurred interest in alkali-intercalated polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds, but their compositions and structures have remained unclear. Now crystalline K2Pentacene and K2Picene — neither of which are superconducting — have been prepared by mild synthesis. Structural analysis shows that the cation sites arise within the molecular layers from reorientation of the PAHs within a herringbone packing.

Alteration of the oxygen-dependent reactivity of de novo Due Ferri proteins

De novo proteins provide a unique opportunity to investigate the structure–function relationships of metalloproteins in a minimal, well-defined and controlled scaffold. Here, we describe the rational programming of function in a de novo designed di-iron carboxylate protein from the Due Ferri family. Originally created to catalyse the O2-dependent, two-electron oxidation of hydroquinones, the protein was reprogrammed to catalyse the selective N-hydroxylation of arylamines by remodelling the substrate access cavity and introducing a critical third His ligand to the metal-binding cavity. Additional second- and third-shell modifications were required to stabilize the His ligand in the core of the protein. These structural changes resulted in at least a 106-fold increase in the relative rate between the arylamine N-hydroxylation and hydroquinone oxidation reactions. This result highlights the potential for using de novo proteins as scaffolds for future investigations of the geometric and electronic factors that influence the catalytic tuning of di-iron active sites. Representing the first successful rational reprogramming of function in a de novo protein, the reactivity of a designed di-iron carboxylate protein from the Due Ferri family was altered from hydroquinone oxidation to arylamine N-hydroxylation through the introduction of a critical third histidine ligand in the active site.

Title: 
A highly stretchable autonomous self-healing elastomer

It is a challenge to synthesize materials that possess the properties of biological muscles—strong, elastic and capable of self-healing. Herein we report a network of poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer chains crosslinked by coordination complexes that combines high stretchability, high dielectric strength, autonomous self-healing and mechanical actuation. The healing process can take place at a temperature as low as −20 °C and is not significantly affected by surface ageing and moisture. The crosslinking complexes used consist of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide ligands that coordinate to Fe(III) centres through three different interactions: a strong pyridyl–iron one, and two weaker carboxamido–iron ones through both the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the carboxamide groups. As a result, the iron–ligand bonds can readily break and re-form while the iron centres still remain attached to the ligands through the stronger interaction with the pyridyl ring, which enables reversible unfolding and refolding of the chains. We hypothesize that this behaviour supports the high stretchability and self-healing capability of the material. Polymers that are both elastic and self-healing are desirable for a variety of applications, but often rely on hydrogen bonding which makes them moisture-sensitive. Now, by incorporating metal–ligand interactions with different bond strengths into flexible polymer backbones, an elastomer has been devised that combines high stretchability and high dielectric strength with autonomous self-healing and mechanical actuation capabilities.

Stability of xenon oxides at high pressures

Xenon, which is quite inert under ambient conditions, may become reactive under pressure. The possibility of the formation of stable xenon oxides and silicates in the interior of the Earth could explain the atmospheric missing xenon paradox. Using an ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we predict the existence of thermodynamically stable Xe–O compounds at high pressures (XeO, XeO2 and XeO3 become stable at pressures above 83, 102 and 114&nbsp;GPa, respectively). Our calculations indicate large charge transfer in these oxides, suggesting that large electronegativity difference and high pressure are the key factors favouring the formation of xenon compounds. However, xenon compounds cannot exist in the Earth's mantle: xenon oxides are unstable in equilibrium with the metallic iron occurring in the lower mantle, and xenon silicates are predicted to decompose spontaneously at all mantle pressures (&lt;136&nbsp;GPa). However, it is possible that xenon atoms may be retained at defects in mantle silicates and oxides. Xenon is an inert element at ambient conditions but may become reactive under pressure. It has now been predicted that pressure stabilizes increasing oxidation states of Xe atoms (from Xe0 to Xe2+ to Xe4+ to Xe6+), and thus a series of compounds — XeO, XeO2 and XeO3 — become thermodynamically stable at megabar pressures.

Catalytic enantioselective synthesis of indanes by a cation-directed 5-endo-trig cyclization

5-Endo-trig cyclizations are generally considered to be kinetically unfavourable, as described by Baldwin's rules. Consequently, observation of this mode of reaction under kinetic control is rare. This is usually ascribed to challenges in achieving appropriate approach trajectories for orbital overlap in the transition state. Here, we describe a highly enantio- and diastereoselective route to complex indanes bearing all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centres via a 5-endo-trig cyclization catalysed by a chiral ammonium salt. Through computation, the preference for the formally disfavoured 5-endo-trig Michael reaction over the formally favoured 5-exo-trig Dieckmann reaction is shown to result from thermodynamic contributions to the innate selectivity of the nucleophilic group, which outweigh the importance of the approach trajectory as embodied by Baldwin's rules. Our experimental and theoretical findings demonstrate that geometric and stereoelectronic constraints may not be decisive in the observed outcome of irreversible ring-closing reactions. A highly enantio- and diastereoselective route to complex indanes via a 5-endo-trig Michael reaction catalysed by a chiral ammonium salt is described. The preference for this formally disfavoured cyclization over a formally favoured alternative shows that geometric and stereoelectronic constraints may not be decisive in the observed outcome of irreversible ring closing reactions.

Suppression of Kasha's rule as a mechanism for fluorescent molecular rotors and aggregation-induced emission

Although there are some proposed explanations for aggregation-induced emission, a phenomenon with applications that range from biosensors to organic light-emitting diodes, current understanding of the quantum-mechanical origin of this photophysical behaviour is limited. To address this issue, we assessed the emission properties of a series of BF2–hydrazone-based dyes as a function of solvent viscosity. These molecules turned out to be highly efficient fluorescent molecular rotors. This property, in addition to them being aggregation-induced emission luminogens, enabled us to probe deeper into their emission mechanism. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations and experimental results showed that the emission is not from the S1 state, as predicted from Kasha's rule, but from a higher energy (&gt;S1) state. Furthermore, we found that suppression of internal conversion to the dark S1 state by restricting the rotor rotation enhances fluorescence, which leads to the proposal that suppression of Kasha's rule is the photophysical mechanism responsible for emission in both viscous solution and the solid state. A family of fluorescent molecular rotors has been developed and their mechanism for emission understood. It has been observed that, although most fluorescent molecules emit from their lowest energy excited state, S1 (in accordance with Kasha's rule), BODIHY dyes do not. Furthermore, their fluorescence is enhanced through restricted rotor rotation, which suppresses internal conversion to the dark S1 state.

Studying the role of protein dynamics in an SN2 enzyme reaction using free-energy surfaces and solvent coordinates

Conformational changes are known to be able to drive an enzyme through its catalytic cycle, allowing, for example, substrate binding or product release. However, the influence of protein motions on the chemical step is a controversial issue. One proposal is that the simple equilibrium fluctuations incorporated into transition-state theory are insufficient to account for the catalytic effect of enzymes and that protein motions should be treated dynamically. Here, we propose the use of free-energy surfaces, obtained as a function of both a chemical coordinate and an environmental coordinate, as an efficient way to elucidate the role of protein structure and motions during the reaction. We show that the structure of the protein provides an adequate environment for the progress of the reaction, although a certain degree of flexibility is needed to attain the full catalytic effect. However, these motions do not introduce significant dynamical corrections to the rate constant and can be described as equilibrium fluctuations. The influence of protein motions on the chemical step of enzyme reactions is a contentious issue. Now, by constructing free-energy surfaces using an explicit solvent coordinate, it is shown that, although some structural flexibility is required, protein motions can be described as equilibrium fluctuations.

Allosteric activation of membrane-bound glutamate receptors using coordination chemistry within living cells

The controlled activation of proteins in living cells is an important goal in protein-design research, but to introduce an artificial activation switch into membrane proteins through rational design is a significant challenge because of the structural and functional complexity of such proteins. Here we report the allosteric activation of two types of membrane-bound neurotransmitter receptors, the ion-channel type and the G-protein-coupled glutamate receptors, using coordination chemistry in living cells. The high programmability of coordination chemistry enabled two His mutations, which act as an artificial allosteric site, to be semirationally incorporated in the vicinity of the ligand-binding pockets. Binding of Pd(2,2′-bipyridine) at the allosteric site enabled the active conformations of the glutamate receptors to be stabilized. Using this approach, we were able to activate selectively a mutant glutamate receptor in live neurons, which initiated a subsequent signal-transduction pathway. The controlled activation of proteins inside living cells is an important goal in protein design research. Now, a strategy for allosteric activation using coordination chemistry has been demonstrated for two different kinds of neurotransmitter receptors, an ion-channel and a G-protein coupled glutamate receptor.

Protein fold determined by paramagnetic magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy

Biomacromolecules that are challenging for the usual structural techniques can be studied with atomic resolution by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. However, the paucity of distance restraints &gt;5&nbsp;Å, traditionally derived from measurements of magnetic dipole–dipole couplings between protein nuclei, is a major bottleneck that hampers such structure elucidation efforts. Here, we describe a general approach that enables the rapid determination of global protein fold in the solid phase via measurements of nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) in several analogues of the protein of interest containing covalently attached paramagnetic tags, without the use of conventional internuclear distance restraints. The method is demonstrated using six cysteine–EDTA–Cu2+ mutants of the 56-residue B1 immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G, for which ~230 longitudinal backbone 15N PREs corresponding to distances of ~10–20&nbsp;Å were obtained. The mean protein fold determined in this manner agrees with the X-ray structure with a backbone atom root-mean-square deviation of 1.8&nbsp;Å. Despite recent progress, solving protein structures using solid-state NMR spectroscopy is not routine. Now, a method for the rapid determination of global protein fold is reported, based on measurements of 15N longitudinal paramagnetic relaxation enhancements in several protein variants modified with covalently attached cysteine–EDTA–Cu2+ tags.

Simple peptides derived from the ribosomal core potentiate RNA polymerase ribozyme function

The emergence of functional interactions between nucleic acids and polypeptides was a key transition in the origin of life and remains at the heart of all biology. However, how and why simple non-coded peptides could have become critical for RNA function is unclear. Here, we show that putative ancient peptide segments from the cores of both ribosomal subunits enhance RNA polymerase ribozyme (RPR) function, as do derived homopolymeric peptides comprising lysine or the non-proteinogenic lysine analogues ornithine or, to a lesser extent, diaminobutyric acid, irrespective of chirality or chiral purity. Lysine decapeptides enhance RPR function by promoting holoenzyme assembly through primer–template docking, accelerate RPR evolution, and allow RPR-catalysed RNA synthesis at near physiological (≥1 mM) Mg2+ concentrations, enabling templated RNA synthesis within membranous protocells. Our results outline how compositionally simple, mixed-chirality peptides may have augmented the functional potential of early RNAs and promoted the emergence of the first protocells. Lysine-rich peptides from the ribosomal core and derived homolysine decapeptides of either L-, D- or mixed chirality have now been shown to enhance RNA polymerase ribozyme activity at low magnesium concentrations, accelerate ribozyme evolution and enable templated RNA synthesis within membranous protocells.

Direct, enantioselective α-alkylation of aldehydes using simple olefins

Although the α-alkylation of ketones has already been established, the analogous reaction using aldehyde substrates has proven surprisingly elusive. Despite the structural similarities between the two classes of compounds, the sensitivity and unique reactivity of the aldehyde functionality has typically required activated substrates or specialized additives. Here, we show that the synergistic merger of three catalytic processes—photoredox, enamine and hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) catalysis—enables an enantioselective α-aldehyde alkylation reaction that employs simple olefins as coupling partners. Chiral imidazolidinones or prolinols, in combination with a thiophenol, iridium photoredox catalyst and visible light, have been successfully used in a triple catalytic process that is temporally sequenced to deliver a new hydrogen and electron-borrowing mechanism. This multicatalytic process enables both intra- and intermolecular aldehyde α-methylene coupling with olefins to construct both cyclic and acyclic products, respectively. With respect to atom and step-economy ideals, this stereoselective process allows the production of high-value molecules from feedstock chemicals in one step while consuming only photons. The catalytic asymmetric α-alkylation of aldehydes has historically been a significant challenge within organic synthesis. Now, this elusive transformation has been achieved through the merger of organocatalysis, photoredox catalysis and hydrogen-atom transfer catalysis to enable the coupling of simple olefins and aldehydes.

Effects of correlated parameters and uncertainty in electronic-structure-based chemical kinetic modelling

Kinetic models based on first principles are becoming common place in heterogeneous catalysis because of their ability to interpret experimental data, identify the rate-controlling step, guide experiments and predict novel materials. To overcome the tremendous computational cost of estimating parameters of complex networks on metal catalysts, approximate quantum mechanical calculations are employed that render models potentially inaccurate. Here, by introducing correlative global sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification, we show that neglecting correlations in the energies of species and reactions can lead to an incorrect identification of influential parameters and key reaction intermediates and reactions. We rationalize why models often underpredict reaction rates and show that, despite the uncertainty being large, the method can, in conjunction with experimental data, identify influential missing reaction pathways and provide insights into the catalyst active site and the kinetic reliability of a model. The method is demonstrated in ethanol steam reforming for hydrogen production for fuel cells. Theoretical electronic-structure methods are routinely used to estimate the parameters of complex kinetic models. It is now shown that uncertainty in such model parameters is correlated and that it can be quantified. An associated sensitivity analysis method is also derived that handles complex systems with many correlated reactions.

Selective, rapid and optically switchable regulation of protein function in live mammalian cells

The rapid and selective regulation of a target protein within living cells that contain closely related family members is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce genetically directed bioorthogonal ligand tethering (BOLT) and demonstrate selective inhibition (iBOLT) of protein function. In iBOLT, inhibitor–conjugate/target protein pairs are created where the target protein contains a genetically encoded unnatural amino acid with bioorthogonal reactivity and the inhibitor conjugate contains a complementary bioorthogonal group. iBOLT enables the first rapid and specific inhibition of MEK isozymes, and introducing photoisomerizable linkers in the inhibitor conjugate enables reversible, optical regulation of protein activity (photo-BOLT) in live mammalian cells. We demonstrate that a pan kinase inhibitor conjugate allows selective and rapid inhibition of the lymphocyte specific kinase, indicating the modularity and scalability of BOLT. We anticipate that BOLT will enable the rapid and selective regulation of diverse proteins for which no selective small-molecule ligands exist. The rapid and selective regulation of a target protein within living cells containing closely related family members is a longstanding challenge. Now the introduction of genetically directed bioorthogonal ligand tethering (BOLT) and the demonstration of selective inhibition (iBOLT) and optical switching (photo-BOLT) of protein function in live mammalian cells addresses this challenge.

Title: 
A synthetic molecular pentafoil knot

Knots are being discovered with increasing frequency in both biological and synthetic macromolecules and have been fundamental topological targets for chemical synthesis for the past two decades. Here, we report on the synthesis of the most complex non-DNA molecular knot prepared to date: the self-assembly of five bis-aldehyde and five bis-amine building blocks about five metal cations and one chloride anion to form a 160-atom-loop molecular pentafoil knot (five crossing points). The structure and topology of the knot is established by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography, revealing a symmetrical closed-loop double helicate with the chloride anion held at the centre of the pentafoil knot by ten CH···Cl– hydrogen bonds. The one-pot self-assembly reaction features an exceptional number of different design elements—some well precedented and others less well known within the context of directing the formation of (supra)molecular species. We anticipate that the strategies and tactics used here can be applied to the rational synthesis of other higher-order interlocked molecular architectures. The most complex non-DNA molecular knot prepared so far is self-assembled around a chloride anion from five metal cations, five bis-aldehyde and five bis-amine building blocks, in a one-pot reaction. The X-ray crystal structure of the 160-atom-loop pentafoil knot reveals a symmetrical closed-loop double helicate with a chloride anion held at its centre by ten CH···Cl− hydrogen bonds.

Terahertz echoes reveal the inhomogeneity of aqueous salt solutions

The structural and dynamical properties of water are known to be affected by ion solvation. However, a consistent molecular picture that describes how and to what extent ions perturb the water structure is still missing. Here we apply 2D Raman–terahertz spectroscopy to investigate the impact of monatomic cations on the relaxation dynamics of the hydrogen-bond network in aqueous salt solutions. The inherent ability of multidimensional spectroscopy to deconvolute heterogeneous relaxation dynamics is used to reveal the correlation between the inhomogeneity of the collective intermolecular hydrogen-bond modes and the viscosity of a salt solution. Specifically, we demonstrate that the relaxation time along the echo direction t1 = t2 correlates with the capability of a given cation to ‘structure’ water. Moreover, we provide evidence that the echo originates from the water–water modes, and not the water–cation modes, which implies that cations can structure the hydrogen-bond network to a certain extent. Ultrafast 2D Raman-THz spectroscopy has been applied to investigate the dynamics of the hydrogen-bond networks in aqueous salt solutions. It was demonstrated that the degree of inhomogeneity of the intermolecular modes of the liquid correlates with the structure-making capability of the cation.

Light-controlled self-assembly of non-photoresponsive nanoparticles

The ability to guide the assembly of nanosized objects reversibly with external stimuli, in particular light, is of fundamental importance, and it contributes to the development of applications as diverse as nanofabrication and controlled drug delivery. However, all the systems described to date are based on nanoparticles (NPs) that are inherently photoresponsive, which makes their preparation cumbersome and can markedly hamper their performance. Here we describe a conceptually new methodology to assemble NPs reversibly using light that does not require the particles to be functionalized with light-responsive ligands. Our strategy is based on the use of a photoswitchable medium that responds to light in such a way that it modulates the interparticle interactions. NP assembly proceeds quantitatively and without apparent fatigue, both in solution and in gels. Exposing the gels to light in a spatially controlled manner allowed us to draw images that spontaneously disappeared after a specific period of time. Controlling the self-assembly of nanoparticles using light has been demonstrated in many systems where the particle surfaces are functionalized with photoswitchable ligands. Now, it has been shown that the light-controlled self-assembly of non-photoresponsive nanoparticles can be achieved in a quantitative and reversible fashion by placing them in a photoresponsive medium.

Reconstitution of [Fe]-hydrogenase using model complexes

[Fe]-Hydrogenase catalyses the reversible hydrogenation of a methenyltetrahydromethanopterin substrate, which is an intermediate step during the methanogenesis from CO2 and H2. The active site contains an iron-guanylylpyridinol cofactor, in which Fe2+ is coordinated by two CO ligands, as well as an acyl carbon atom and a pyridinyl nitrogen atom from a 3,4,5,6-substituted 2-pyridinol ligand. However, the mechanism of H2 activation by [Fe]-hydrogenase is unclear. Here we report the reconstitution of [Fe]-hydrogenase from an apoenzyme using two FeGP cofactor mimics to create semisynthetic enzymes. The small-molecule mimics reproduce the ligand environment of the active site, but are inactive towards H2 binding and activation on their own. We show that reconstituting the enzyme using a mimic that contains a 2-hydroxypyridine group restores activity, whereas an analogous enzyme with a 2-methoxypyridine complex was essentially inactive. These findings, together with density functional theory computations, support a mechanism in which the 2-hydroxy group is deprotonated before it serves as an internal base for heterolytic H2 cleavage. [Fe]-hydrogenase has an iron-guanylylpyridinol cofactor and catalyses the reversible hydrogenation of a methenyl-tetrahydromethanopterin. Now, [Fe]-hydrogenase has been reconstituted using synthetic cofactor mimics. The enzyme containing a mimic with a 2-hydroxy-pyridine group was active, whereas one containing a 2-methoxy-pyridine group was inactive. This result, together with DFT computations, supports a catalytic mechanism involving the deprotonated pyridinol hydroxy group as a proton acceptor.

Title: 
Bicyclic Baird-type aromaticity

Classic formulations of aromaticity have long been associated with topologically planar conjugated macrocyclic systems. The theoretical possibility of so-called bicycloaromaticity was noted early on. However, it has yet to be demonstrated by experiment in a simple synthetic organic molecule. Conjugated organic systems are attractive for studying the effect of structure on electronic features. This is because, in principle, they can be modified readily through dedicated synthesis. As such, they can provide useful frameworks for testing by experiment with fundamental insights provided by theory. Here we detail the synthesis and characterization of two purely organic non-planar dithienothiophene-bridged [34]octaphyrins that permit access to two different aromatic forms as a function of the oxidation state. In their neutral forms, these congeneric systems contain competing 26 and 34 π-electronic circuits. When subject to two-electron oxidation, electronically mixed [4n+1]/[4n+1] triplet biradical species in the ground state are obtained that display global aromaticity in accord with Baird's rule. Realization of the bicyclic aromaticity has attracted much attention because of the potential to modulate the fundamental properties of 3D aromatic organic molecules that are not topologically planar. Now, the synthesis and characterization of dual-aromatic molecules, and their electronically mixed [4n+1]/[4n+1] triplet bi-radical species displaying Baird-type aromaticity, has been realized.

Title: 
The aromatic ene reaction

The ene reaction is a pericyclic process in which an alkene with an allylic hydrogen atom (the ene donor) reacts with a second unsaturated species (the enophile) to form a new product with a transposed π-bond. The aromatic ene reaction, in which the alkene component is embedded in an aromatic ring, has only been reported in a few (four) instances and has proceeded in low yield (≤6%). Here, we show efficient aromatic ene reactions in which a thermally generated aryne intermediate engages a pendant m-alkylarene substituent to produce a dearomatized isotoluene, itself another versatile but rare reactive intermediate. Our experiments were guided by computational studies that revealed structural features conducive to the aromatic ene process. We proceeded to identify a cascade comprising three reactions: (1) hexadehydro-Diels–Alder (for aryne generation), (2) intramolecular aromatic ene and (3) bimolecular Alder ene. The power of this cascade is evident from the structural complexity of the final products, the considerable scope, and the overall efficiency of these multistage, reagent- and by-product-free, single-pot transformations. An aryne intermediate produced by a hexadehydro-Diels–Alder reaction is shown to engage in an unusual — and before this work rare and inefficient — aromatic ene reaction to produce an isotoluene. This second reactive intermediate can then engage an external enophile resulting in a conjunctive cascade in which four C–C bonds and three rings are created without involvement of reagents or generation of by-products.

Programming molecular self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins containing sequences of low complexity

Dynamic protein-rich intracellular structures that contain phase-separated intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) composed of sequences of low complexity (SLC) have been shown to serve a variety of important cellular functions, which include signalling, compartmentalization and stabilization. However, our understanding of these structures and our ability to synthesize models of them have been limited. We present design rules for IDPs possessing SLCs that phase separate into diverse assemblies within droplet microenvironments. Using theoretical analyses, we interpret the phase behaviour of archetypal IDP sequences and demonstrate the rational design of a vast library of multicomponent protein-rich structures that ranges from uniform nano-, meso- and microscale puncta (distinct protein droplets) to multilayered orthogonally phase-separated granular structures. The ability to predict and program IDP-rich assemblies in this fashion offers new insights into (1) genetic-to-molecular-to-macroscale relationships that encode hierarchical IDP assemblies, (2) design rules of such assemblies in cell biology and (3) molecular-level engineering of self-assembled recombinant IDP-rich materials. A programmable model of membraneless organelles comprised of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) containing sequences of low complexity has now been developed. The rules governing the assembly of archetypal IDPs into biologically inspired mixed, layered and size-controlled configurations provides a new means for understanding intracellular phase behaviour of IDPs.

Title: 
The essential role of charge-shift bonding in hypervalent prototype XeF2

Hypervalency in XeF2 and isoelectronic complexes is generally understood in terms of the Rundle–Pimentel model (which invokes a three-centre/four-electron molecular system) or its valence bond version as proposed by Coulson, which replaced the old expanded octet model of Pauling. However, the Rundle–Pimentel model is not always successful in describing such complexes and has been shown to be oversimplified. Here using ab initio valence bond theory coupled to quantum Monte Carlo methods, we show that the Rundle–Pimentel model is insufficient by itself in accounting for the great stability of XeF2, and that charge-shift bonding, wherein the large covalent–ionic interaction energy has the dominant role, is a major stabilizing factor. The energetic contribution of the old expanded octet model is also quantified and shown to be marginal. Generalizing to isoelectronic systems such as ClF3, SF4, PCl5 and others, it is suggested that charge-shift bonding is necessary, in association with the Rundle–Pimentel model, for hypervalent analogues of XeF2 to be strongly bonded. Complexes featuring rare gas atoms can be very strongly bonded even though these hypervalent molecules violate the octet rule. Now ab initio valence bond calculations on the XeF2 prototype highlight the essential role of charge-shift bonding, in which the covalent–ionic resonance energy is exceptionally large.

Title: 
Organocatalytic asymmetric arylation of indoles enabled by azo groups

Arylation is a fundamental reaction that can be mostly fulfilled by electrophilic aromatic substitution and transition-metal-catalysed aryl functionalization. Although the azo group has been used as a directing group for many transformations via transition-metal-catalysed aryl carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bond activation, there remain significant unmet challenges in organocatalytic arylation. Here, we show that the azo group can effectively act as both a directing and activating group for organocatalytic asymmetric arylation of indoles via formal nucleophilic aromatic substitution of azobenzene derivatives. Thus, a wide range of axially chiral arylindoles have been achieved in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities by utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as catalyst. Furthermore, highly enantioenriched pyrroloindoles bearing two contiguous quaternary chiral centres have also been obtained via a cascade enantioselective formal nucleophilic aromatic substitution–cyclization process. This strategy should be useful in other related research fields and will open new avenues for organocatalytic asymmetric aryl functionalization. The use of activating and directing groups can dramatically alter the course of a reaction. Now, it has been shown that an azo group can effectively perform as both in chiral phosphoric-acid catalysed formal nucleophilic aromatic substitution of azobenzene derivatives with indoles, affording axially chiral arylindoles with excellent enantioselectivities.

Title: 
Enabling singlet fission by controlling intramolecular charge transfer in π-stacked covalent terrylenediimide dimers

When an assembly of two or more molecules absorbs a photon to form a singlet exciton, and the energetics and intermolecular interactions are favourable, the singlet exciton can rapidly and spontaneously produce two triplet excitons by singlet fission. To understand this process is important because it may prove to be technologically significant for enhancing solar-cell performance. Theory strongly suggests that charge-transfer states are involved in singlet fission, but their role has remained an intriguing puzzle and, up until now, no molecular system has provided clear evidence for such a state. Here we describe a terrylenediimide dimer that forms a charge-transfer state in a few picoseconds in polar solvents, and undergoes equally rapid, high-yield singlet fission in nonpolar solvents. These results show that adjusting the charge-transfer-state energy relative to those of the exciton states can serve to either inhibit or promote singlet fission. Singlet fission in assemblies of molecular chromophores offers a promising route to improving solar cell efficiencies, but its mechanism is not fully understood. Now, a series of covalently bound π-stacked terrylenediimide dimers have been studied to elucidate the role of interchromophore charge-transfer states in the mechanism of singlet fission.

Title: 
A transferable model for singlet-fission kinetics

Exciton fission is a process that occurs in certain organic materials whereby one singlet exciton splits into two independent triplets. In photovoltaic devices these two triplet excitons can each generate an electron, producing quantum yields per photon of &gt;100% and potentially enabling single-junction power efficiencies above 40%. Here, we measure fission dynamics using ultrafast photoinduced absorption and present a first-principles expression that successfully reproduces the fission rate in materials with vastly different structures. Fission is non-adiabatic and Marcus-like in weakly interacting systems, becoming adiabatic and coupling-independent at larger interaction strengths. In neat films, we demonstrate fission yields near unity even when monomers are separated by &gt;5&nbsp;Å. For efficient solar cells, however, we show that fission must outcompete charge generation from the singlet exciton. This work lays the foundation for tailoring molecular properties like solubility and energy level alignment while maintaining the high fission yield required for photovoltaic applications. Understanding the process of exciton fission, which occurs in certain organic materials, could lead to the development of more efficient photovoltaic devices. Here, an expression derived from first principles is used to accurately characterize the singlet fission rate of a wide array of materials, reproducing a transition from weak to strong coupling as a function of molecular separation.

Molecular motor-driven abrupt anisotropic shape change in a single crystal of a Ni complex

Many molecular machines with controllable molecular-scale motors have been developed. However, transmitting molecular movement to the macroscopic scale remains a formidable challenge. Here we report a single crystal of a Ni complex whose shape changes abruptly and reversibly in response to thermal changes at around room temperature. Variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies show that the crystalline shape change is induced by an unusual 90° rotation of uniaxially aligned oxalate molecules. The oxalate dianions behave as molecular-scale rotors, with their movement propagated through the entire crystalline material via intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Consequently, the subnanometre-scale changes in the oxalate molecules are instantly amplified to a micrometre-scale contraction or expansion of the crystal, accompanied by a thermal hysteresis loop. The shape change in the crystal was clearly detected under an optical microscope. The large directional deformation and prompt response suggest a role for this material in microscale or nanoscale thermal actuators. Transferring molecular motion to macroscopic shape change of a crystal has potential application in actuators, or ‘artificial muscles’. Now, a single crystal of a Ni complex has been shown to exhibit a large, abrupt, temperature-induced crystal expansion/contraction near room temperature. The crystal deformation is induced by a collective 90° rotation of oxalate anions in the complex.

Iterative design of a helically folded aromatic oligoamide sequence for the selective encapsulation of fructose

The ab initio design of synthetic molecular receptors for a specific biomolecular guest remains an elusive objective, particularly for targets such as monosaccharides, which have very close structural analogues. Here we report a powerful approach to produce receptors with very high selectivity for specific monosaccharides and, as a demonstration, we develop a foldamer that selectively encapsulates fructose. The approach uses an iterative design process that exploits the modular structure of folded synthetic oligomer sequences in conjunction with molecular modelling and structural characterization to inform subsequent refinements. Starting from a first-principles design taking size, shape and hydrogen-bonding ability into account and using the high predictability of aromatic oligoamide foldamer conformations and their propensity to crystallize, a sequence that binds to β-D-fructopyranose in organic solvents with atomic-scale complementarity was obtained in just a few iterative modifications. This scheme, which mimics the adaptable construction of biopolymers from a limited number of monomer units, provides a general protocol for the development of selective receptors. Designing synthetic molecular receptors that can differentiate between specific monosaccharide guests is very challenging. Now, a helically folded oligoamide that selectively encapsulates fructose has been designed using an iterative approach that exploits the modular structure of folded synthetic oligomer sequences, in conjunction with molecular modelling and structural characterization.

Efficient discovery of bioactive scaffolds by activity-directed synthesis

The structures and biological activities of natural products have often provided inspiration in drug discovery. The functional benefits of natural products to the host organism steers the evolution of their biosynthetic pathways. Here, we describe a discovery approach—which we term activity-directed synthesis—in which reactions with alternative outcomes are steered towards functional products. Arrays of catalysed reactions of α-diazo amides, whose outcome was critically dependent on the specific conditions used, were performed. The products were assayed at increasingly low concentration, with the results informing the design of a subsequent reaction array. Finally, promising reactions were scaled up and, after purification, submicromolar ligands based on two scaffolds with no previous annotated activity against the androgen receptor were discovered. The approach enables the discovery, in tandem, of both bioactive small molecules and associated synthetic routes, analogous to the evolution of biosynthetic pathways to yield natural products. A discovery approach termed activity-directed synthesis is described; it exploits arrays of reactions whose outcome is critically dependent on the conditions used, and prioritizes reactions that yield bioactive product mixtures. The discovery of both bioactive small molecules and associated synthetic routes thus occurs in parallel.

Metal–organic frameworks with dynamic interlocked components

The dynamics of mechanically interlocked molecules such as rotaxanes and catenanes have been studied in solution as examples of rudimentary molecular switches and machines, but in this medium, the molecules are randomly dispersed and their motion incoherent. As a strategy for achieving a higher level of molecular organization, we have constructed a metal–organic framework material using a [2]rotaxane as the organic linker and binuclear Cu(II) units as the nodes. Activation of the as-synthesized material creates a void space inside the rigid framework that allows the soft macrocyclic ring of the [2]rotaxane to rotate rapidly, unimpeded by neighbouring molecular components. Variable-temperature 13C and 2H solid-state NMR experiments are used to characterize the nature and rate of the dynamic processes occurring inside this unique material. These results provide a blueprint for the future creation of solid-state molecular switches and molecular machines based on mechanically interlocked molecules. The dynamics of mechanically interlocked molecules such as catenanes and rotaxanes have been studied in solution as examples of rudimentary molecular switches and machines. A metal–organic framework with a [2]rotaxane as a building block demonstrates that such dynamic processes can also operate inside a solid-state material.

Probing chemical space with alkaloid-inspired libraries

Screening of small-molecule libraries is an important aspect of probe and drug discovery science. Numerous authors have suggested that bioactive natural products are attractive starting points for such libraries because of their structural complexity and sp3-rich character. Here, we describe the construction of a screening library based on representative members of four families of biologically active alkaloids (Stemonaceae, the structurally related cyclindricine and lepadiformine families, lupin and Amaryllidaceae). In each case, scaffolds were based on structures of the naturally occurring compounds or a close derivative. Scaffold preparation was pursued following the development of appropriate enabling chemical methods. Diversification provided 686 new compounds suitable for screening. The libraries thus prepared had structural characteristics, including sp3 content, comparable to a basis set of representative natural products and were highly rule-of-five compliant. It has been suggested that bioactive natural products are an attractive starting point for the construction of screening libraries. Here, four families of biologically active alkaloids are used as the basis for the construction of 686 new compounds suitable for screening. The libraries thus prepared have characteristics comparable to representative natural products and are highly rule-of-five compliant.

Title: 
Ultrafast above-threshold dynamics of the radical anion of a prototypical quinone electron-acceptor

Quinones feature prominently as electron acceptors in nature. Their electron-transfer reactions are often highly exergonic, for which Marcus theory predicts reduced electron-transfer rates because of a free-energy barrier that occurs in the inverted region. However, the electron-transfer kinetics that involve quinones can appear barrierless. Here, we consider the intrinsic properties of the para-benzoquinone radical anion, which serves as the prototypical electron-transfer reaction product involving a quinone-based acceptor. Using time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we show that excitation at 400 and 480&nbsp;nm yields excited states that are unbound with respect to electron loss. These excited states are shown to decay on a sub-40 fs timescale through a series of conical intersections with lower-lying excited states, ultimately to form the ground anionic state and avoid autodetachment. From an isolated electron-acceptor perspective, this ultrafast stabilization mechanism accounts for the ability of para-benzoquinone to capture and retain electrons. Quinones are key electron acceptors in nature, however, the role of their excited states is not fully understood. Femtosecond spectroscopy and quantum calculations on the prototypical parabenzoquinone radical anion provide insight into quinones’ intrinsic electron-accepting ability, revealing how unbound electronically excited states relax to form the ground-state radical anion.

A missing link in the transformation from asymmetric to symmetric metallofullerene cages implies a top-down fullerene formation mechanism

Although fullerenes were discovered nearly three decades ago, the mechanism of their formation remains a mystery. Many versions of the classic ‘bottom-up’ formation mechanism have been advanced, starting with C2 units that build up to form chains and rings of carbon atoms and ultimately form those well-known isolated fullerenes (for example, Ih-C60). In recent years, evidence from laboratory and interstellar observations has emerged to suggest a ‘top-down’ mechanism, whereby small isolated fullerenes are formed via shrinkage of giant fullerenes generated from graphene sheets. Here, we present molecular structural evidence for this top-down mechanism based on metal carbide metallofullerenes M2C2@C1(51383)-C84 (M&nbsp;=&nbsp;Y, Gd). We propose that the unique asymmetric C1(51383)-C84 cage with destabilizing fused pentagons is a preserved ‘missing link’ in the top-down mechanism, and in well-established rearrangement steps can form many well-known, high-symmetry fullerene structures that account for the majority of solvent-extractable metallofullerenes. An asymmetric pentalene-containing C1(51383)-C84 fullerene cage is found in two different metal carbide metallofullerenes. This particular cage can, in simple steps, rearrange into many well-known fullerene cages that are more stable and more symmetric, suggesting it is likely that metallofullerenes are generated by a ‘top-down’ formation mechanism.

Non-lattice surface oxygen species implicated in the catalytic partial oxidation of decane to oxygenated aromatics

The one-step transformation of C7–C12 linear alkanes into more valuable oxygenates provides heterogeneous catalysis with a major challenge. In evaluating the potential of a classic mixed-metal-oxide catalyst, we demonstrate new insights into the reactivity of adsorbed oxygen species. During the aerobic gas-phase conversion of n-decane over iron molybdate, the product distribution correlates with the condition of the catalyst. Selectivity to oxygenated aromatics peaks at 350&nbsp;°C while the catalyst is in a fully oxidized state, whereas decene and aromatic hydrocarbons dominate at higher temperatures. The high-temperature performance is consistent with an underlying redox mechanism in which lattice oxide ions abstract hydrogen from decane. At lower temperatures, the formation of oxygenated aromatics competes with the formation of CO2, implying that electrophilic adsorbed oxygen is involved in both reactions. We suggest, therefore, that so-called non-selective oxygen is capable of insertion into carbon-rich surface intermediates to generate aromatic partial oxidation products. Mixed-metal oxide catalysts oxidize hydrocarbons into CO and CO2 through surface oxygen species that have yet to form lattice oxide ions. The one-step oxidation of decane into a range of oxygenated aromatics by a fully oxidized iron molybdate catalyst has now revealed that these species can also be involved in selective oxygen insertion.

Ionization of dimethyluracil dimers leads to facile proton transfer in the absence of hydrogen bonds

Proton transfer is ubiquitous in chemistry and biology, occurring, for example, in proteins, enzyme reactions and across proton channels and pumps. However, it has always been described in the context of hydrogen-bonding networks (‘proton wires’) acting as proton conduits. Here, we report efficient intramolecular ionization-induced proton transfer across a 1,3-dimethyluracil dimer, a model π-stacked system with no hydrogen bonds. Upon photoionization by tunable vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation, the dimethyluracil dimer undergoes proton transfer and dissociates to produce a protonated monomer. Deuterated dimethyluracil experiments confirm that proton transfer occurs from the methyl groups and not from the aromatic C–H sites. Calculations reveal qualitative differences between the proton transfer reaction coordinate in the π-stacked and hydrogen-bonded base pairs, and that proton transfer in methylated dimers involves significant rearrangements of the two fragments, facilitating a relatively low potential energy barrier of only 0.6&nbsp;eV in the ionized dimer. Proton transfer is usually considered in the context of hydrogen-bonding networks serving as proton-shuttling pathways. Now, an efficient ionization-induced proton transfer in the absence of hydrogen bonds has been observed in a model π-stacked system, the 1,3-dimethyluracil dimer.

Elucidating bonding preferences in tetrakis(imido)uranate(VI) dianions

Actinyl species, [AnO2]2+, are well-known derivatives of the f-block because of their natural occurrence and essential roles in the nuclear fuel cycle. Along with their nitrogen analogues, [An(NR)2]2+, actinyls are characterized by their two strong trans-An–element multiple bonds, a consequence of the inverse trans influence. We report that these robust bonds can be weakened significantly by increasing the number of multiple bonds to uranium, as demonstrated by a family of uranium(VI) dianions bearing four U–N multiple bonds, [M]2[U(NR)4] (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs). Their geometry is dictated by cation coordination and sterics rather than by electronic factors. Multiple bond weakening by the addition of strong π donors has the potential for applications in the processing of high-valent actinyls, commonly found in environmental pollutants and spent nuclear fuels. The field of high-valent uranium chemistry has been dominated by the linear uranyl moiety [UO2]2+ and its imido analogues. A family of tetrakis(imido)uranate dianions has now been developed that displays four uranium–nitrogen multiple bonds. Their geometry is dictated by cation coordination and steric factors rather than electronic ones.

Designed, synthetically accessible bryostatin analogues potently induce activation of latent HIV reservoirs in vitro

Bryostatin is a unique lead in the development of potentially transformative therapies for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and the eradication of HIV/AIDS. However, the clinical use of bryostatin has been hampered by its limited supply, difficulties in accessing clinically relevant derivatives, and side effects. Here, we address these problems through the step-economical syntheses of seven members of a new family of designed bryostatin analogues using a highly convergent Prins-macrocyclization strategy. We also demonstrate for the first time that such analogues effectively induce latent HIV activation in vitro with potencies similar to or better than bryostatin. Significantly, these analogues are up to 1,000-fold more potent in inducing latent HIV expression than prostratin, the current clinical candidate for latent virus induction. This study provides the first demonstration that designed, synthetically accessible bryostatin analogues could serve as superior candidates for the eradication of HIV/AIDS through induction of latent viral reservoirs in conjunction with current antiretroviral therapy. Simplified bryostatin analogues are shown to potently induce latent HIV expression in vitro. These analogues display comparable or better potency when compared with bryostatin. Moreover, they are up to 1,000-fold more potent in inducing latent HIV expression than prostratin, the current lead preclinical candidate.

Three-way switching in a cyanide-bridged [CoFe] chain

Bistable compounds that exist in two interchangeable phases under identical conditions can act as switches under external stimuli. Among such switchable materials, coordination complexes have energy levels (or phases) that are determined by the electronic states of their constituent metal ions and ligands. They can exhibit multiple bistabilities and hold promise in the search for multifaceted materials that display different properties in different phases, accessible through the application of contrasting external stimuli. Molecular systems that exhibit both thermo- and photoinduced magnetic bistabilities are excellent candidates for such systems. Here we describe a cyanide-bridged [CoFe] one-dimensional chiral coordination polymer that displays both magnetic and electric bistabilities in the same temperature range. Both the electric and magnetic switching probably arise from the same electron-transfer coupled spin-transition phenomenon, which enables the reversible conversion between an insulating diamagnetic phase and either a semiconducting paramagnetic (thermoinduced) or a type of ferromagnetic single-chain magnet (photoinduced) state. Bistable materials, which exist in either one of two phases under identical conditions, are intriguing both from a fundamental perspective and for their practical applications. A cyanide-bridged [CoFe] coordination chain has now been prepared that shows both magnetic and electric bistabilities in the same temperature range, undergoing thermo- and photo-induced conversions between insulating, semiconducting and single-chain magnet-type phases.

Title: 
Chemical polyglycosylation and nanolitre detection enables single-molecule recapitulation of bacterial sugar export

The outermost protective layer of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is composed of bacterial capsular polysaccharides. Insights into the interactions between the capsular polysaccharide and its transporter and the mechanism of sugar export would not only increase our understanding of this key process, but would also help in the design of novel therapeutics to block capsular polysaccharide export. Here, we report a nanolitre detection system that makes use of the bilayer interface between two droplets, and we use this system to study single-molecule recapitulation of sugar export. A synthetic strategy of polyglycosylation based on tetrasaccharide monomers enables ready synthetic access to extended fragments of K30 oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Examination of the interactions between the Escherichia coli sugar transporter Wza and very small amounts of fragments of the K30 capsular polysaccharide substrate reveal the translocation of smaller but not larger fragments. We also observe capture events that occur only on the intracellular side of Wza, which would complement coordinated feeding by adjunct biosynthetic machinery. Capsular polysaccharides are a protective layer enveloping pathogenic bacteria. Understanding their export could guide the design of therapeutics that render bacteria vulnerable to attack by the immune system or other therapeutic agents. Now, a synthetic strategy of polyglycosylation has been developed to obtain defined capsular polysaccharide fragments. Subsequent nanolitre detection enables their export to be studied at the single-molecule level.

Copolymerization of carbon dioxide and butadiene via a lactone intermediate

Although carbon dioxide has attracted broad interest as a renewable carbon feedstock, its use as a monomer in copolymerization with olefins has long been an elusive endeavour. A major obstacle for this process is that the propagation step involving carbon dioxide is endothermic; typically, attempted reactions between carbon dioxide and an olefin preferentially yield olefin homopolymerization. Here we report a strategy to circumvent the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers for copolymerizations of carbon dioxide and olefins by using a metastable lactone intermediate, 3-ethylidene-6-vinyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is formed by the palladium-catalysed condensation of carbon dioxide and 1,3-butadiene. Subsequent free-radical polymerization of the lactone intermediate afforded polymers of high molecular weight with a carbon dioxide content of 33&nbsp;mol% (29 wt%). Furthermore, the protocol was applied successfully to a one-pot copolymerization of carbon dioxide and 1,3-butadiene, and one-pot terpolymerizations of carbon dioxide, butadiene and another 1,3-diene. This copolymerization technique provides access to a new class of polymeric materials made from carbon dioxide. Radical polymerization of a metastable lactone intermediate — formed from carbon dioxide and butadiene using a palladium catalyst — produces a high-CO2-content (29 wt%) polymer. This approach circumvents the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers typically associated with direct copolymerization of carbon dioxide and olefins, and can also be applied to one-pot co- and terpolymerization of carbon dioxide and 1,3-butadienes.

A direct approach to amines with remote stereocentres by enantioselective CuH-catalysed reductive relay hydroamination

Amines with remote stereocentres (stereocentres that are three or more bonds away from the C–N bond) are important structural elements in many pharmaceutical agents and natural products. However, previously reported methods to prepare these compounds in an enantioselective manner are indirect and require multistep synthesis. Here, we report a copper-hydride-catalysed, enantioselective synthesis of γ- or δ-chiral amines from readily available allylic alcohols, esters and ethers using a reductive relay hydroamination strategy (a net reductive process in which an amino group is installed at a site remote from the original carbon–carbon double bond). The protocol was suitable for substrates containing a wide range of functional groups and provided remote chiral amine products with high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity. Sequential amination of substrates containing several carbon–carbon double bonds could be achieved, demonstrating the high chemoselectivity of this process. Single operation transformations that enantioselectively install a stereogenic centre while introducing a distal functional group are synthetically valuable but rare processes. Now, a copper-catalysed reductive relay hydroamination process that simultaneously creates a remote chiral centre is described. The resulting γ- and δ-chiral amines are important structural elements in many pharmaceutical agents and natural products.

Title: 
Diindeno-fusion of an anthracene as a design strategy for stable organic biradicals

The consequence of unpaired electrons in organic molecules has fascinated and confounded chemists for over a century. The study of open-shell molecules has been rekindled in recent years as new synthetic methods, improved spectroscopic techniques and powerful computational tools have been brought to bear on this field. Nonetheless, it is the intrinsic instability of the biradical species that limits the practicality of this research. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a molecule based on the diindeno[b,i]anthracene framework that exhibits pronounced open-shell character yet possesses remarkable stability. The synthetic route is rapid, efficient and possible on the gram scale. The molecular structure was confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. From variable-temperature Raman spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements a thermally accessible triplet excited state was found. Organic field-effect transistor device data show an ambipolar performance with balanced electron and hole mobilities. Our results demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of an air- and temperature-stable biradical compound. Biradical polycyclic hydrocarbons are promising materials for organic spintronic and photovoltaic applications. The efficient and scalable synthesis of a diindenoanthracene derivative that exhibits moderate biradical character, yet is remarkably stable towards oxygen and heat, is now reported. A thermally accessible magnetic triplet state was studied through variable temperature techniques.

Efficient green methanol synthesis from glycerol

The production of biodiesel from the transesterification of plant-derived triglycerides with methanol has been commercialized extensively. Impure glycerol is obtained as a by-product at roughly one-tenth the mass of the biodiesel. Utilization of this crude glycerol is important in improving the viability of the overall process. Here we show that crude glycerol can be reacted with water over very simple basic or redox oxide catalysts to produce methanol in high yields, together with other useful chemicals, in a one-step low-pressure process. Our discovery opens up the possibility of recycling the crude glycerol produced during biodiesel manufacture. Furthermore, we show that molecules containing at least two hydroxyl groups can be converted into methanol, which demonstrates some aspects of the generality of this new chemistry. Impure glycerol is obtained as a significant by-product of biodiesel production. Now it is shown that this crude glycerol can be reacted with water over very simple basic or redox oxide catalysts to produce methanol in high yields, together with other useful chemicals, in a one-step low pressure process.

Title: 
The direct anti-Markovnikov addition of mineral acids to styrenes

The direct anti-Markovnikov addition of strong Brønsted acids to alkenes remains an unsolved problem in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an efficient organic photoredox catalyst system for the addition of HCl, HF and also phosphoric and sulfonic acids to alkenes, with complete regioselectivity. These transformations were developed using a photoredox catalyst in conjunction with a redox-active hydrogen atom donor. The nucleophile counterion plays a critical role by ensuring high reactivity, with 2,6-lutidinium salts typically furnishing the best results. The nature of the redox-active hydrogen atom donor is also consequential, with 4-methoxythiophenol providing the best reactivity when 2,6-lutidinium salts are used. A novel acridinium sensitizer provides enhanced reactivity within several of the more challenging reaction manifolds. This Article demonstrates how nucleophilic addition reactions mediated by photoredox catalysis can change the way electrophilic and homofugal precursors are constructed. Strong mineral acids usually add to alkenes such that hydrogen is added to the least substituted carbon — a pattern known as Markovnikov addition. Now, using photoredox catalysis in conjunction with a redox-active hydrogen atom donor, it has been shown that this pattern can be reversed to produce otherwise difficult to access products.

Title: 
Homochiral polymerization-driven selective growth of graphene nanoribbons

The surface-assisted bottom-up fabrication of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which consists of the radical polymerization of precursors followed by dehydrogenation, has attracted attention because of the method's ability to control the edges and widths of the resulting ribbon. Although these reactions on a metal surface are believed to be catalytic, the mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate ‘conformation-controlled surface catalysis’: the two-zone chemical vapour deposition of a ‘Z-bar-linkage’ precursor, which represents two terphenyl units linked in a ‘Z’ shape, results in the efficient formation of acene-type GNRs with a width of 1.45 nm through optimized cascade reactions. These precursors exhibit flexibility that allows them to adopt chiral conformations with height asymmetry on a Au(111) surface, which enables the production of self-assembled homochiral polymers in a chain with a planar conformation, followed by dehydrogenation via a conformation-controlled mechanism. This is conceptually analogous to enzymatic catalysis and will be useful for the fabrication of new nanocarbon materials. Metal surfaces have been believed to be catalytic, but the mechanism of catalysis is unknown. Now, graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) can be grown on Au(111) from a ‘Z-bar-linkage' precursor through a conformation-controlled mechanism. Chemical vapour deposition of precursors adopting a chiral conformation produced homochiral polymers, which are dehydrogenated to form GNRs.

Title: 
RNA with iron(II) as a cofactor catalyses electron transfer

Mg2+ is essential for RNA folding and catalysis. However, for the first 1.5 billion years of life on Earth RNA inhabited an anoxic Earth with abundant and benign Fe2+. We hypothesize that Fe2+ was an RNA cofactor when iron was abundant, and was substantially replaced by Mg2+ during a period known as the ‘great oxidation’, brought on by photosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate that reversing this putative metal substitution in an anoxic environment, by removing Mg2+ and replacing it with Fe2+, expands the catalytic repertoire of RNA. Fe2+ can confer on some RNAs a previously uncharacterized ability to catalyse single-electron transfer. We propose that RNA function, in analogy with protein function, can be understood fully only in the context of association with a range of possible metals. The catalysis of electron transfer, requisite for metabolic activity, may have been attenuated in RNA by photosynthesis and the rise of O2. Removing Mg2+ from RNA and replacing it with Fe2+ confers on some RNAs the ability to catalyse single-electron transfer. Here, it is hypothesized that Fe2+ was an RNA cofactor on the early Earth, when iron was benign and abundant, and was replaced by Mg2+ during a period known as the great oxidation, brought on by photosynthesis.

Title: 
Submolecular control, spectroscopy and imaging of bond-selective chemistry in single functionalized molecules

One of the key challenges in chemistry is to break and form bonds selectively in complex organic molecules that possess a range of different functional groups. To do this at the single-molecule level not only provides an opportunity to create custom nanoscale devices, but offers opportunities for the in-depth study of how the molecular electronic structure changes in individual reactions. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to induce a sequence of targeted bond dissociation and formation steps in single thiol-based π-conjugated molecules adsorbed on a NiAl(110) surface. Furthermore, the electronic resonances of the resulting species were measured by spatially resolved electronic spectroscopy at each reaction step. Specifically, the STM was used to cleave individual acetyl groups and to form Au–S bonds by manipulating single Au atoms. A detailed understanding of the Au–S bond and its non-local influence is fundamentally important for determining the electron transport in thiol-based molecular junction. The selective dissociation and formation of different functional groups in a single organic molecule may prove useful for making nanoscale devices and offer new opportunities for studying changes in electronic structure. It has now been shown that bond-selective chemistry can be induced and visualized at the submolecular level in a complex thiol-based molecule using a scanning tunnelling microscope.

Title: 
Placing and shaping liposomes with reconfigurable DNA nanocages

The diverse structure and regulated deformation of lipid bilayer membranes are among a cell's most fascinating features. Artificial membrane-bound vesicles, known as liposomes, are versatile tools for modelling biological membranes and delivering foreign objects to cells. To fully mimic the complexity of cell membranes and optimize the efficiency of delivery vesicles, controlling liposome shape (both statically and dynamically) is of utmost importance. Here we report the assembly, arrangement and remodelling of liposomes with designer geometry: all of which are exquisitely controlled by a set of modular, reconfigurable DNA nanocages. Tubular and toroid shapes, among others, are transcribed from DNA cages to liposomes with high fidelity, giving rise to membrane curvatures present in cells yet previously difficult to construct in vitro. Moreover, the conformational changes of DNA cages drive membrane fusion and bending with predictable outcomes, opening up opportunities for the systematic study of membrane mechanics. Controlling liposome shape, arrangement and dynamics is important for biophysical studies and synthetic biology applications. Now, using a family of reconfigurable DNA nanocages as templates, spherical, tubular, toroidal and helical liposomes with predefined geometry have been produced. DNA-guided membrane fusion and bending is also demonstrated.

Title: 
Oligoarginine peptides slow strand annealing and assist non-enzymatic RNA replication

The non-enzymatic replication of RNA is thought to have been a critical process required for the origin of life. One unsolved difficulty with non-enzymatic RNA replication is that template-directed copying of RNA results in a double-stranded product. After strand separation, rapid strand reannealing outcompetes slow non-enzymatic template copying, which renders multiple rounds of RNA replication impossible. Here we show that oligoarginine peptides slow the annealing of complementary oligoribonucleotides by up to several thousand-fold; however, short primers and activated monomers can still bind to template strands, and template-directed primer extension can still occur, all within a phase-separated condensed state, or coacervate. Furthermore, we show that within this phase, partial template copying occurs even in the presence of full-length complementary strands. This method to enable further rounds of replication suggests one mechanism by which short non-coded peptides could have enhanced early cellular fitness, and potentially explains how longer coded peptides, that is, proteins, came to prominence in modern biology. Identifying a non-enzymatic method of replicating RNA for multiple cycles has been problematic because rapid strand reannealing outcompetes slow non-enzymatic template copying. Now, oligoarginine peptides have been shown to inhibit reannealing while still allowing short primers and activated monomers to bind to the template strand, facilitating the next round of template copying.

Title: 
Label-assisted mass spectrometry for the acceleration of reaction discovery and optimization

The identification of new reactions expands our knowledge of chemical reactivity and enables new synthetic applications. Accelerating the pace of this discovery process remains challenging. We describe a highly effective and simple platform for screening a large number of potential chemical reactions in order to discover and optimize previously unknown catalytic transformations, thereby revealing new chemical reactivity. Our strategy is based on labelling one of the reactants with a polyaromatic chemical tag, which selectively undergoes a photoionization/desorption process upon laser irradiation, without the assistance of an external matrix, and enables rapid mass spectrometric detection of any products originating from such labelled reactants in complex reaction mixtures without any chromatographic separation. This method was successfully used for high-throughput discovery and subsequent optimization of two previously unknown benzannulation reactions. The development of new reaction methodology is a core activity for organic chemists, but the process can be slow and can rely on serendipity. Here, a reaction discovery platform is described that relies on the labelling of a reaction component with a chemical tag that enables rapid mass spectrometric detection of the derived products in complex mixtures.

Quantitative visualization of DNA G-quadruplex structures in human cells

Four-stranded G-quadruplex nucleic acid structures are of great interest as their high thermodynamic stability under near-physiological conditions suggests that they could form in cells. Here we report the generation and application of an engineered, structure-specific antibody employed to quantitatively visualize DNA G-quadruplex structures in human cells. We show explicitly that G-quadruplex formation in DNA is modulated during cell-cycle progression and that endogenous G-quadruplex DNA structures can be stabilized by a small-molecule ligand. Together these findings provide substantive evidence for the formation of G-quadruplex structures in the genome of mammalian cells and corroborate the application of stabilizing ligands in a cellular context to target G-quadruplexes and intervene with their function. A structure-specific antibody generated and employed to visualize DNA G-quadruplex structures in human cells shows that these structures are modulated during the cell cycle and can be stabilized by a small-molecule ligand. This provides substantive evidence for endogenous DNA G-quadruplex formation in mammalian cells.

Title: 
Applying green chemistry to the photochemical route to artemisinin

Artemisinin is an important antimalarial drug, but, at present, the environmental and economic costs of its semi-synthetic production are relatively high. Most of these costs lie in the final chemical steps, which follow a complex acid- and photo-catalysed route with oxygenation by both singlet and triplet oxygen. We demonstrate that applying the principles of green chemistry can lead to innovative strategies that avoid many of the problems in current photochemical processes. The first strategy combines the use of liquid CO2 as solvent and a dual-function solid acid/photocatalyst. The second strategy is an ambient-temperature reaction in aqueous mixtures of organic solvents, where the only inputs are dihydroartemisinic acid, O2 and light, and the output is pure, crystalline artemisinin. Everything else—solvents, photocatalyst and aqueous acid—can be recycled. Some aspects developed here through green chemistry are likely to have wider application in photochemistry and other reactions. Two semi-synthetic processes for the production of the antimalarial natural product artemisinin have been developed by applying the principles of green chemistry. Solvent manipulation allows catalyst recycling and reduction of waste, ultimately leading to a purification-free process with lower environmental and economic costs; a potential contribution to the world-wide fight against malaria.

Title: 
Ligand-modulated conformational switching in a fully synthetic membrane-bound receptor

Signal transduction through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involves binding to signalling molecules at the cell surface, which leads to global changes in molecular conformation that are communicated through the membrane. Artificial mechanisms for communication involving ligand binding and global conformational switching have been demonstrated so far only in the solution phase. Here, we report a membrane-bound synthetic receptor that responds to binding of a ligand by undergoing a conformational change that is propagated over several nanometres, deep into the phospholipid bilayer. Our design uses a helical foldamer core, with structural features borrowed from a class of membrane-active fungal antibiotics, ligated to a water-compatible, metal-centred binding site and a conformationally responsive fluorophore. Using the fluorophore as a remote reporter of conformational change, we find that binding of specific carboxylate ligands to a Cu(II) cofactor at the binding site perturbs the foldamer's global conformation, mimicking the conformational response of a GPCR to ligand binding. A dynamic foldamer scaffold has now been ligated to a water-compatible, metal-centred binding site and a conformationally responsive fluorophore to form a receptor mimic that inserts into the membrane of artificial vesicles. Binding of specific carboxylate ligands induces a global conformational change that depends on the structure of the ligand, and can be detected via fluorescence.

Title: 
Entomopathogenic bacteria use multiple mechanisms for bioactive peptide library design

The production of natural product compound libraries has been observed in nature for different organisms such as bacteria, fungi and plants; however, little is known about the mechanisms generating such chemically diverse libraries. Here we report mechanisms leading to the biosynthesis of the chemically diverse rhabdopeptide/xenortide peptides (RXPs). They are exclusively present in entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus that live in symbiosis with nematodes delivering them to insect prey, which is killed and utilized for nutrition by both nematodes and bacteria. Chemical diversity of the biologically active RXPs results from a combination of iterative and flexible use of monomodular nonribosomal peptide synthetases including substrate promiscuity, enzyme cross-talk and enzyme stoichiometry as shown by in vivo and in vitro experiments. Together, this highlights several of nature's methods for diversification, or evolution, of natural products and sheds light on the biosynthesis of the bioactive RXPs. Nature has evolved a variety of different mechanisms to generate chemical diversity; however, the reactions responsible for generating such diverse chemical libraries are often not clear. Now, the mechanisms employed by entomopathogenic bacteria for the biosynthesis of a large family of bioactive peptides have been identified. These include substrate promiscuity, enzyme cross-talk and enzyme stoichiometry.

Title: 
Temporal separation of catalytic activities allows anti-Markovnikov reductive functionalization of terminal alkynes

There is currently great interest in the development of multistep catalytic processes in which one or several catalysts act sequentially to rapidly build complex molecular structures. Many enzymes—often the inspiration for new synthetic transformations—are capable of processing a single substrate through a chain of discrete, mechanistically distinct catalytic steps. Here, we describe an approach to emulate the efficiency of these natural reaction cascades within a synthetic catalyst by the temporal separation of catalytic activities. In this approach, a single catalyst exhibits multiple catalytic activities sequentially, allowing for the efficient processing of a substrate through a cascade pathway. Application of this design strategy has led to the development of a method to effect the anti-Markovnikov (linear-selective) reductive functionalization of terminal alkynes. The strategy of temporal separation may facilitate the development of other efficient synthetic reaction cascades. Multifunctional catalysts typically process substrates and intermediates concurrently. Here, a strategy is described to separate catalytic activities in the time domain (temporal separation). Application of this strategy has led to the development of a method to effect the anti-Markovnikov reductive functionalization of terminal alkynes; such an approach may facilitate the development of other synthetic reaction cascades.

Title: 
Encoding complexity within supramolecular analogues of frustrated magnets

The solid phases of gold(I) and/or silver(I) cyanides are supramolecular assemblies of inorganic polymer chains in which the key structural degrees of freedom—namely, the relative vertical shifts of neighbouring chains—are mathematically equivalent to the phase angles of rotating planar (‘XY’) spins. Here, we show how the supramolecular interactions between chains can be tuned to mimic different magnetic interactions. In this way, the structures of gold(I) and/or silver(I) cyanides reflect the phase behaviour of triangular XY magnets. Complex magnetic states predicted for this family of magnets—including collective spin-vortices of relevance to data storage applications—are realized in the structural chemistry of these cyanide polymers. Our results demonstrate how chemically simple inorganic materials can behave as structural analogues of otherwise inaccessible ‘toy’ spin models and also how the theoretical understanding of those models allows control over collective (‘emergent’) phenomena in supramolecular systems. Competing metallophilic and electrostatic interactions between gold and/or silver cyanide chains govern their assembly into different structures. An analogy has now been drawn between these systems and two-dimensional magnets. Supramolecular interactions between the chains have been tuned to mimic different magnetic interactions, leading to the realization of complex states predicted for magnets.

Catalytic enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric biaryls by a cation-directed O-alkylation

Axially chiral biaryls, as exemplified by 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL), are key components of catalysts, natural products and medicines. These materials are synthesized conventionally in enantioenriched form through metal-mediated cross coupling, de novo construction of an aromatic ring, point-to-axial chirality transfer or an atropselective transformation of an existing biaryl. Here, we report a highly enantioselective organocatalytic method for the synthesis of atropisomeric biaryls by a cation-directed O-alkylation. Treatment of racemic 1-aryl-2-tetralones with a chiral quinidine-derived ammonium salt under basic conditions in the presence of an alkylating agent leads to atropselective O-alkylation with e.r. up to 98:2. Oxidation with DDQ gives access to C2-symmetric and non-symmetric BINOL derivatives without compromising e.r. We propose that the chiral ammonium counterion differentiates between rapidly equilibrating atropisomeric enolates, leading to highly atropselective O-alkylation. This dynamic kinetic resolution process offers a general approach to the synthesis of enantioenriched atropisomeric materials. A chiral ammonium salt mediates a dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic α-aryl ketones by atropselective O-alkylation. Oxidation with DDQ gives access to C2-symmetric and non-symmetric BINOL derivatives in high yields and with high enantioselectivity.

Title: 
Catalytic, stereospecific syn-dichlorination of alkenes

As some of the oldest organic chemical reactions known, the ionic additions of elemental halogens such as bromine and chlorine to alkenes are prototypical examples of stereospecific reactions, typically delivering vicinal dihalides resulting from anti-addition. Although the invention of enantioselective variants is an ongoing challenge, the ability to overturn the intrinsic anti-diastereospecificity of these transformations is also a largely unsolved problem. Here, we describe the first catalytic, syn-stereospecific dichlorination of alkenes, employing a group transfer catalyst based on a redox-active main group element (selenium). With diphenyl diselenide (PhSeSePh) (5 mol%) as the pre-catalyst, benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BnEt3NCl) as the chloride source and an N-fluoropyridinium salt as the oxidant, a wide variety of functionalized cyclic and acyclic 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, including simple allylic alcohols, deliver syn-dichlorides with exquisite stereocontrol. This methodology is expected to find applications in streamlining the synthesis of polychlorinated natural products such as the chlorosulfolipids. The synthetic challenge of constructing arrays of contiguous, chlorinated stereogenic centres in natural products, like the chlorosulfolipids, has sparked recent interest in new methods for stereocontrolled chlorination. Now the first catalytic, syn-stereospecific dichlorination of alkenes, employing a redox-active main group element as a group transfer catalyst is described.

Synthesis of marmycin A and investigation into its cellular activity

Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin are used extensively in the treatment of cancers. Anthraquinone-related angucyclines also exhibit antiproliferative properties and have been proposed to operate via similar mechanisms, including direct genome targeting. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of marmycin A and the study of its cellular activity. The aromatic core was constructed by means of a one-pot multistep reaction comprising a regioselective Diels–Alder cycloaddition, and the complex sugar backbone was introduced through a copper-catalysed Ullmann cross-coupling, followed by a challenging Friedel–Crafts cyclization. Remarkably, fluorescence microscopy revealed that marmycin A does not target the nucleus but instead accumulates in lysosomes, thereby promoting cell death independently of genome targeting. Furthermore, a synthetic dimer of marmycin A and the lysosome-targeting agent artesunate exhibited a synergistic activity against the invasive MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line. These findings shed light on the elusive pathways through which anthraquinone derivatives act in cells, pointing towards unanticipated biological and therapeutic applications. Marmycin A is an anthraquinone natural product with antiproliferative properties. Now the chemical synthesis of marmycin A—through a Diels–Alder cycloaddition, an Ullmann aromatic amination and a Friedel–Crafts cyclization—has enabled a study of its biological activity. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that marmycin A accumulates in lysosomes and promotes cell death independently of genome targeting.

Title: 
Scalable enantioselective total synthesis of taxanes

Taxanes form a large family of terpenes comprising over 350 members, the most famous of which is Taxol (paclitaxel), a billion-dollar anticancer drug. Here, we describe the first practical and scalable synthetic entry to these natural products via a concise preparation of (+)-taxa-4(5),11(12)-dien-2-one, which has a suitable functional handle with which to access more oxidized members of its family. This route enables a gram-scale preparation of the ‘parent’ taxane—taxadiene—which is the largest quantity of this naturally occurring terpene ever isolated or prepared in pure form. The characteristic 6-8-6 tricyclic system of the taxane family, containing a bridgehead alkene, is forged via a vicinal difunctionalization/Diels–Alder strategy. Asymmetry is introduced by means of an enantioselective conjugate addition that forms an all-carbon quaternary centre, from which all other stereocentres are fixed through substrate control. This study lays a critical foundation for a planned access to minimally oxidized taxane analogues and a scalable laboratory preparation of Taxol itself. The taxane diterpene family is structurally complex and exhibits a wide range of biological activities, best exemplified by the successful drug Taxol. Here, two of the least oxidized taxanes in the family, ‘taxadienone’ and taxadiene, are prepared by total synthesis on a gram scale. The concise synthetic route described herein provides a scalable, enantioselective entry to the taxane family of natural products.

Switching on the fluorescence of 2-aminopurine by site-selective microhydration

2-Aminopurine (2AP) is a fluorescent isomer of adenine and has a fluorescence lifetime of ~11 ns in water. It is widely used in biochemical settings as a site-specific fluorescent probe of DNA and RNA structure and base-flipping and -folding. These assays assume that 2AP is intrinsically strongly fluorescent. Here, we show this not to be the case, observing that gas-phase, jet-cooled 2-aminopurine and 9-methyl-2-aminopurine have very short fluorescence lifetimes (156 ps and 210 ps, respectively); they are, to all intents and purposes, non-fluorescent. We find that the lifetime of 2-aminopurine increases dramatically when it is part of a hydrate cluster, 2AP·(H2O)n, where n = 1–3. Not only does it depend on the presence of water molecules, it also depends on the specific hydrogen-bonding site to which they attach and on the number of H2O molecules at that site. We selectively microhydrate 2-aminopurine at its sugar-edge, cis-amino or trans-amino sites and see that its fluorescence lifetime increases by 4, 50 and 95 times (to 14.5 ns), respectively. The adenine analogue 2-aminopurine has been considered as intrinsically fluorescent and is widely used in biochemical assays to probe DNA and RNA structure. It is now shown that the molecule alone is nearly non-fluorescent, however, its fluorescence is increased by up to 95 times through hydrogen bonding to a single water molecule.

Direct assembly of multiply oxygenated carbon chains by decarbonylative radical–radical coupling reactions

Pentoses and hexoses contain more than three oxygen-bearing stereocentres and are ideal starting materials for the synthesis of multiply oxygenated natural products such as sagittamide D, maitotoxin and hikizimycin. Here we demonstrate new radical–radical homocoupling reactions of sugar derivatives with minimal perturbation of their chiral centres. The radical exchange procedure using Et3B/O2 converted sugar-derived α-alkoxyacyl tellurides into α-alkoxy radicals via decarbonylation and rapidly dimerized the monomeric radicals. The robustness of this process was demonstrated by a single-step preparation of 12 stereochemically diverse dimers with 6–10 secondary hydroxy groups, including the C5–C10 stereohexad of sagittamide D and the enantiomer of the C51–C60 stereodecad of maitotoxin. Furthermore, the optimally convergent radical–radical cross-coupling reaction achieved a one-step assembly of the protected C1–C11 oxygenated carbon chain of the anthelmintic hikizimycin. These exceptionally efficient homo- and heterocoupling methods together provide a powerful strategy for the expedited total synthesis of contiguously hydroxylated natural products. Pentoses and hexoses represent important structural motifs in bioactive secondary metabolites, though their synthesis often requires several elongation steps. Now, a method for radical–radical coupling reactions of sugar derivatives enables the single-step preparation of the oxygenated carbon chains of several natural products, including sagittamide D, maitotoxin and hikizimycin.

The rate of the F + H2 reaction at very low temperatures

The prototypical F&nbsp;+&nbsp;H2&nbsp;→&nbsp;HF&nbsp;+&nbsp;H reaction possesses a substantial energetic barrier (~800&nbsp;K) and might therefore be expected to slow to a negligible rate at low temperatures. It is, however, the only source of interstellar HF, which has been detected in a wide range of cold (10–100&nbsp;K) environments. In fact, the reaction does take place efficiently at low temperatures due to quantum-mechanical tunnelling. Rate constant measurements at such temperatures have essentially been limited to fast barrierless reactions, such as those between two radicals. Using uniform supersonic hydrogen flows we can now report direct experimental measurements of the rate of this reaction down to a temperature of 11&nbsp;K, in remarkable agreement with state-of-the-art quantum reactive scattering calculations. The results will allow a stronger link to be made between observations of interstellar HF and the abundance of the most common interstellar molecule, H2, and hence a more accurate estimation of the total mass of astronomical objects. The reaction F&nbsp;+&nbsp;H2&nbsp;→&nbsp;HF&nbsp;+&nbsp;H is the only source of interstellar HF, but studying it at relevant cold temperatures has proved problematic. Now, the rates of this reaction have been measured at various temperatures down to 11 K and their remarkable agreement with state-of-the-art quantum mechanical calculations has been shown.

Title: 
Evolution of thermophilic DNA polymerases for the recognition and amplification of C2ʹ-modified DNA

The PCR amplification of oligonucleotides enables the evolution of sequences called aptamers that bind specific targets with antibody-like affinity. However, in many applications the use of these aptamers is limited by nuclease-mediated degradation. In contrast, oligonucleotides that are modified at their sugar C2ʹ positions with methoxy or fluorine substituents are stable to nucleases, but they cannot be synthesized by natural polymerases. Here we report the development of a polymerase-evolution system and its use to evolve thermostable polymerases that efficiently interconvert C2ʹ-OMe-modified oligonucleotides and their DNA counterparts via ‘transcription’ and ‘reverse transcription’ or, more importantly, that PCR-amplify partially C2ʹ-OMe- or C2ʹ-F-modified oligonucleotides. A mechanistic analysis demonstrates that the ability to amplify the modified oligonucleotides evolved by optimizing interdomain interactions that stabilize the catalytically competent closed conformation of the polymerase. The evolved polymerases should find practical applications and the developed evolution system should be a powerful tool for tailoring polymerases to have other types of novel function. Naturally occurring DNA polymerases can amplify DNA efficiently via PCR, but they cannot utilize C2′-modified substrates to make non-natural nucleic acids. Such C2′-modified nucleic acids are of interest as they are resistant to nucleases. Now, a Stoffel fragment DNA polymerase has been evolved to transcribe C2′-modified DNA from a DNA template, reverse transcribe C2′-modified DNA back into DNA, and PCR-amplify C2′-modified DNA.

Synthetic nat- or ent-steroids in as few as five chemical steps from epichlorohydrin

Today, more than 100 Food and Drug Administration-approved steroidal agents are prescribed daily for indications including heart failure, inflammation, pain and cancer. While triumphs in organic chemistry have enabled the establishment and sustained growth of the steroid pharmaceutical industry, the production of highly functionalized synthetic steroids of varying substitution and stereochemistry remains challenging, despite the numerous reports of elegant strategies for their de novo synthesis. Here, we describe an advance in chemical synthesis that has established an enantiospecific means to access novel steroids with unprecedented facility and flexibility through the sequential use of two powerful ring-forming reactions: a modern metallacycle-mediated annulative cross-coupling and a new acid-catalysed vinylcyclopropane rearrangement cascade. In addition to accessing synthetic steroids of either enantiomeric series, these steroidal products have been selectively functionalized within each of the four carbocyclic rings, a synthetic ent-steroid has been prepared on a multigram scale, the enantiomer of a selective oestrogen has been synthesized, and a novel ent-steroid with growth inhibitory properties in three cancer cell lines has been discovered. Steroids are arguably the most well studied and successful class of natural-product-inspired pharmaceuticals, yet step-economical and enantiospecific de novo synthesis remains challenging. Now, it is shown that the combination of metallacycle-mediated annulative cross-coupling and vinyl cyclopropane rearrangement chemistry can be used to deliver a variety of partially aromatic synthetic steroids in a concise, flexible and enantiospecific fashion.

Ultrafast dynamics in the power stroke of a molecular rotary motor

Light-driven molecular motors convert light into mechanical energy through excited-state reactions. Unidirectional rotary molecular motors based on chiral overcrowded alkenes operate through consecutive photochemical and thermal steps. The thermal (helix inverting) step has been optimized successfully through variations in molecular structure, but much less is known about the photochemical step, which provides power to the motor. Ultimately, controlling the efficiency of molecular motors requires a detailed picture of the molecular dynamics on the excited-state potential energy surface. Here, we characterize the primary events that follow photon absorption by a unidirectional molecular motor using ultrafast fluorescence up-conversion measurements with sub 50 fs time resolution. We observe an extraordinarily fast initial relaxation out of the Franck–Condon region that suggests a barrierless reaction coordinate. This fast molecular motion is shown to be accompanied by the excitation of coherent excited-state structural motion. The implications of these observations for manipulating motor efficiency are discussed. The light-driven power stroke of a unidirectional molecular motor is studied using ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy. The evolution on the excited-state energy surface is observed on the 100 fs timescale and is accompanied by damped coherent molecular motion. The implications of these observations for the operation of the molecular motors are discussed.

Global profiling of lysine reactivity and ligandability in the human proteome

Nucleophilic amino acids make important contributions to protein function, including performing key roles in catalysis and serving as sites for post-translational modification. Electrophilic groups that target amino-acid nucleophiles have been used to create covalent ligands and drugs, but have, so far, been mainly limited to cysteine and serine. Here, we report a chemical proteomic platform for the global and quantitative analysis of lysine residues in native biological systems. We have quantified, in total, more than 9,000 lysines in human cell proteomes and have identified several hundred residues with heightened reactivity that are enriched at protein functional sites and can frequently be targeted by electrophilic small molecules. We have also discovered lysine-reactive fragment electrophiles that inhibit enzymes by active site and allosteric mechanisms, as well as disrupt protein–protein interactions in transcriptional regulatory complexes, emphasizing the broad potential and diverse functional consequences of liganding lysine residues throughout the human proteome. A chemical proteomic strategy has now been reported for the global profiling of lysine reactivity and ligandability. Using this approach, &gt;9000 lysines in the human proteome were evaluated, leading to the discovery of hyper-reactive lysines, and lysines that can be targeted by electrophilic small molecules to perturb enzyme function and protein–protein interactions.

Common origins of RNA, protein and lipid precursors in a cyanosulfidic protometabolism

A minimal cell can be thought of as comprising informational, compartment-forming and metabolic subsystems. To imagine the abiotic assembly of such an overall system, however, places great demands on hypothetical prebiotic chemistry. The perceived differences and incompatibilities between these subsystems have led to the widely held assumption that one or other subsystem must have preceded the others. Here we experimentally investigate the validity of this assumption by examining the assembly of various biomolecular building blocks from prebiotically plausible intermediates and one-carbon feedstock molecules. We show that precursors of ribonucleotides, amino acids and lipids can all be derived by the reductive homologation of hydrogen cyanide and some of its derivatives, and thus that all the cellular subsystems could have arisen simultaneously through common chemistry. The key reaction steps are driven by ultraviolet light, use hydrogen sulfide as the reductant and can be accelerated by Cu(I)–Cu(II) photoredox cycling. A minimal cell — one that has all the minimum requirements for life — is still a complex entity comprising informational, compartment-forming and metabolic subsystems. Here it is shown that, contrary to previous assumptions, a common prebiotically plausible chemistry can give rise to building blocks for all the subsystems.

Title: 
An M18L24 stellated cuboctahedron through post-stellation of an M12L24 core

Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, well-known to mathematicians, have been recently constructed by chemists at a molecular scale by defining the vertices and the edges with metal ions (M) and organic ligands (L), respectively. Here, we report the first synthesis of a concave-surface ‘stellated polyhedron’, constructed by extending the faces of its precursor polyhedron until they intersect, forming additional nodes. Our approach involves the formation of an M12L24 cuboctahedron core, the linkers of which each bear a pendant ligand site that is subsequently able to bind an additional metal centre to form the stellated M18L24 cuboctahedron. During this post-stellation process, the square faces of the M12L24 core are closed by coordination of the pendant moieties to the additional metal centres, but they are re-opened on removing these metals ions from the vertices. This behaviour is reminiscent of the analogous metal-triggered gate opening–closing switches found in spherical virus capsids. A molecular ‘stellated polyhedron’ with concave faces — constructed by extending the faces of its counterpart polyhedron until they intersect — has now been synthesized. Ligands that constitute the square faces of a metal–organic cuboctahedral cage were decorated with pendant side chains, which reversibly coordinate to additional metal centres to give rise to the stellated cage.

Title: 
Deep-hole transfer leads to ultrafast charge migration in DNA hairpins

Charge transport through the DNA double helix is of fundamental interest in chemistry and biochemistry, but also has potential technological applications such as for DNA-based nanoelectronics. For the latter, it is of considerable interest to explore ways to influence or enhance charge transfer. In this Article we demonstrate a new mechanism for DNA charge transport, namely ‘deep-hole transfer’, which involves long-range migration of a hole through low-lying electronic states of the nucleobases. Here, we demonstrate, in a combined experimental and theoretical study, that it is possible to achieve such transfer behaviour by changing the energetics of charge injection. This mechanism leads to an enhancement in transfer rates by up to two orders of magnitude and much weaker distance dependence. This transfer is faster than relaxation to the lowest-energy state, setting this mechanism apart from those previously described. This opens up a new direction to optimize charge transfer in DNA with unprecedented charge-transfer rates. Charge transfer in DNA is of fundamental interest in chemistry and biochemistry and has possible applications in nano-electronics. Now it has been shown, through a combined experimental and theoretical study, that the migration of positive charges through low-lying orbitals of nucleobases (deep-hole transfer) leads to charge transfer that is faster than previously considered transport regimes.

Title: 
Efficient, non-toxic anion transport by synthetic carriers in cells and epithelia

Transmembrane anion transporters (anionophores) have potential for new modes of biological activity, including therapeutic applications. In particular they might replace the activity of defective anion channels in conditions such as cystic fibrosis. However, data on the biological effects of anionophores are scarce, and it remains uncertain whether such molecules are fundamentally toxic. Here, we report a biological study of an extensive series of powerful anion carriers. Fifteen anionophores were assayed in single cells by monitoring anion transport in real time through fluorescence emission from halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein. A bis-(p-nitrophenyl)ureidodecalin shows especially promising activity, including deliverability, potency and persistence. Electrophysiological tests show strong effects in epithelia, close to those of natural anion channels. Toxicity assays yield negative results in three cell lines, suggesting that promotion of anion transport may not be deleterious to cells. We therefore conclude that synthetic anion carriers are realistic candidates for further investigation as treatments for cystic fibrosis. Synthetic anion transporters that replace the activity of defective anion channels have been proposed as treatments for cystic fibrosis; however, it remains uncertain whether such molecules are fundamentally toxic. A series of bis- and tris-(thio)ureas capable of transporting anions have now been tested in cells expressing halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein. One bis-urea compound proved especially effective while showing almost no toxicity.

Discovery of a Ni-Ga catalyst for carbon dioxide reduction to methanol

The use of methanol as a fuel and chemical feedstock could become very important in the development of a more sustainable society if methanol could be efficiently obtained from the direct reduction of CO2 using solar-generated hydrogen. If hydrogen production is to be decentralized, small-scale CO2 reduction devices are required that operate at low pressures. Here, we report the discovery of a Ni-Ga catalyst that reduces CO2 to methanol at ambient pressure. The catalyst was identified through a descriptor-based analysis of the process and the use of computational methods to identify Ni-Ga intermetallic compounds as stable candidates with good activity. We synthesized and tested a series of catalysts and found that Ni5Ga3 is particularly active and selective. Comparison with conventional Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the same or better methanol synthesis activity, as well as considerably lower production of CO. We suggest that this is a first step towards the development of small-scale low-pressure devices for CO2 reduction to methanol. A Ni-Ga catalyst that reduces CO2 to methanol at ambient pressure has been discovered through a descriptor-based computational analysis, and has been shown experimentally to be particularly active and selective. This represents a first step towards the development of small-scale low-pressure processes for CO2 reduction to methanol from distributed hydrogen production.

Title: 
Optimizing the specificity of nucleic acid hybridization

The specific hybridization of complementary sequences is an essential property of nucleic acids, enabling diverse biological and biotechnological reactions and functions. However, the specificity of nucleic acid hybridization is compromised for long strands, except near the melting temperature. Here, we analytically derived the thermodynamic properties of a hybridization probe that would enable near-optimal single-base discrimination and perform robustly across diverse temperature, salt and concentration conditions. We rationally designed ‘toehold exchange’ probes that approximate these properties, and comprehensively tested them against five different DNA targets and 55 spurious analogues with energetically representative single-base changes (replacements, deletions and insertions). These probes produced discrimination factors between 3 and 100+ (median, 26). Without retuning, our probes function robustly from 10&nbsp;°C to 37&nbsp;°C, from 1&nbsp;mM Mg2+ to 47&nbsp;mM Mg2+, and with nucleic acid concentrations from 1&nbsp;nM to 5&nbsp;µM. Experiments with RNA also showed effective single-base change discrimination. High-fidelity pairing of nucleic acid polymers is important in the development of sensors and for the application of DNA nanotechnology. Here, a set of hybridization probes is described that discriminates single-base changes with high specificity. The probes function robustly across many different temperatures, salinities and nucleic acid concentrations.

High-performance Ag–Co alloy catalysts for electrochemical oxygen reduction

The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction is the limiting half-reaction for low-temperature hydrogen fuel cells, and currently costly Pt-based electrocatalysts are used to generate adequate rates. Although most other metals are not stable in typical acid-mediated cells, alkaline environments permit the use of less costly electrodes, such as silver. Unfortunately, monometallic silver is not sufficiently active for economical fuel cells. Herein we demonstrate the design of low-cost Ag–Co surface alloy nanoparticle electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction. Their performance relative to that of Pt is potential dependent, but reaches over half the area-specific activity of Pt nanoparticle catalysts and is more than a fivefold improvement over pure silver nanoparticles at typical operating potentials. The Ag–Co electrocatalyst was initially identified with quantum chemical calculations and then synthesized using a novel technique that generates a surface alloy, despite bulk immiscibility of the constituent materials. Characterization studies support the hypothesis that the activity improvement comes from a ligand effect, in which cobalt atoms perturb surface silver sites. The oxygen reduction reaction limits fuel cell performance and currently requires costly electrocatalysts with high platinum content to achieve adequate power densities. Now a silver–cobalt surface alloy electrocatalyst has been developed for the oxygen reduction reaction that is stable in alkaline electrolytes and is more economical than traditional platinum-based materials.

Title: 
Mechanically triggered heterolytic unzipping of a low-ceiling-temperature polymer

Biological systems rely on recyclable materials resources such as amino acids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. When biomaterials are damaged as a result of aging or stress, tissues undergo repair by a depolymerization–repolymerization sequence of remodelling. Integration of this concept into synthetic materials systems may lead to devices with extended lifetimes. Here, we show that a metastable polymer, end-capped poly(o-phthalaldehyde), undergoes mechanically initiated depolymerization to revert the material to monomers. Trapping experiments and steered molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with a heterolytic scission mechanism. The obtained monomer was repolymerized by a chemical initiator, effectively completing a depolymerization–repolymerization cycle. By emulating remodelling of biomaterials, this model system suggests the possibility of smart materials where aging or mechanical damage triggers depolymerization, and orthogonal conditions regenerate the polymer when and where necessary. Strong acoustic fields applied to solutions of linear polymers typically result in mid-chain scission, yielding products half the molecular weight of the original. Now it has been shown that poly(o-phthalaldehyde), a polymer with a ceiling temperature below room temperature, undergoes chain scission and subsequent depolymerization to monomers. Introduction of an appropriate initiator to the monomer regenerates poly(o-phthaladehyde) macromolecules.

Title: 
A frustrated-Lewis-pair approach to catalytic reduction of alkynes to cis-alkenes

Frustrated Lewis pairs are compounds containing both Lewis acidic and Lewis basic moieties, where the formation of an adduct is prevented by steric hindrance. They are therefore highly reactive, and have been shown to be capable of heterolysis of molecular hydrogen, a property that has led to their use in hydrogenation reactions of polarized multiple bonds. Here, we describe a general approach to the hydrogenation of alkynes to cis-alkenes under mild conditions using the unique ansa-aminohydroborane as a catalyst. Our approach combines several reactions as the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle: hydroboration (substrate binding), heterolytic hydrogen splitting (typical frustrated-Lewis-pair reactivity) and facile intramolecular protodeborylation (product release). The mechanism is verified by experimental and computational studies. Frustrated Lewis pairs have been shown to be capable of heterolysis of strong covalent bonds such as those in molecular hydrogen, and have been used in the hydrogenation of polar multiple bonds. Here, a new type of ansa-aminohydroborane is shown to be active for the partial hydrogenation of alkynes under mild conditions.

Title: 
Catalyst design for natural-gas upgrading through oxybromination chemistry

Natural gas contains large volumes of light alkanes, and its abundant reserves make it an appealing feedstock for value-added chemicals and fuels. However, selectively activating the C–H bonds in these useful hydrocarbons is one of the greatest challenges in catalysis. Here we report an attractive oxybromination method for the one-step functionalization of methane under mild conditions that integrates gas-phase alkane bromination with heterogeneously catalysed HBr oxidation, a step that is usually executed separately. Catalyst-design strategies to provide optimal synergy between these two processes are discussed. Among many investigated material families, vanadium phosphate (VPO) is identified as the best oxybromination catalyst, as it provides selectivity for CH3Br up to 95% and stable operation for over 100 hours on stream. The outstanding performance of VPO is rationalized by its high activity in HBr oxidation and low propensity for methane and bromomethane oxidation. Data on the oxybromination of ethane and propane over VPO suggest that the reaction network for higher alkanes is more complex. Efficiently and selectively activating the C–H bonds within the light alkanes of natural gas is a challenge that must be overcome if we are to make the most of Earth's abundant reserves. An oxybromination method that functionalizes methane under mild conditions has now been developed and vanadium phosphate was identified as the best catalyst for this reaction.

Title: 
π-Clamp-mediated cysteine conjugation

Site-selective functionalization of complex molecules is one of the most significant challenges in chemistry. Typically, protecting groups or catalysts must be used to enable the selective modification of one site among many that are similarly reactive, and general strategies that selectively tune the local chemical environment around a target site are rare. Here, we show a four-amino-acid sequence (Phe-Cys-Pro-Phe), which we call the ‘π-clamp’, that tunes the reactivity of its cysteine thiol for site-selective conjugation with perfluoroaromatic reagents. We use the π-clamp to selectively modify one cysteine site in proteins containing multiple endogenous cysteine residues. These examples include antibodies and cysteine-based enzymes that would be difficult to modify selectively using standard cysteine-based methods. Antibodies modified using the π-clamp retained binding affinity to their targets, enabling the synthesis of site-specific antibody–drug conjugates for selective killing of HER2-positive breast cancer cells. The π-clamp is an unexpected approach to mediate site-selective chemistry and provides new avenues to modify biomolecules for research and therapeutics. Incorporation of a π-clamp—a four-residue sequence (Phe-Cys-Pro-Phe)—into a protein enables the site-specific modification of the π-clamp cysteine side-chain. The π-clamp can be genetically encoded and does not require protecting-groups or catalysts to provide selective conjugation.

Spontaneous reduction and C–H borylation of arenes mediated by uranium(III) disproportionation

Transition-metal–arene complexes such as bis(benzene)chromium Cr(η6-C6H6)2 are historically important to d-orbital bonding theory and have modern importance in organic synthesis, catalysis and organic spintronics. In investigations of f-block chemistry, however, arenes are invariably used as solvents rather than ligands. Here, we show that simple uranium complexes UX3 (X&nbsp;=&nbsp;aryloxide, amide) spontaneously disproportionate, transferring an electron and X-ligand, allowing the resulting UX2 to bind and reduce arenes, forming inverse sandwich molecules [X2U(µ-η6:η6-arene)UX2] and a UX4 by-product. Calculations and kinetic studies suggest a ‘cooperative small-molecule activation’ mechanism involving spontaneous arene reduction as an X-ligand is transferred. These mild reaction conditions allow functionalized arenes such as arylsilanes to be incorporated. The bulky UX3 are also inert to reagents such as boranes that would react with the traditional harsh reaction conditions, allowing the development of a new in situ arene C–H bond functionalization methodology converting C–H to C–B bonds. Simple uranium complexes, UX3, are shown to disproportionate in the presence of a reducing agent under mild conditions, cooperatively binding and reducing arenes. This enables arene C–H bond activation and borylation, and the trapping of reactive substituted arenes in inverse sandwich complexes.

Title: 
End-to-end conformational communication through a synthetic purinergic receptor by ligand-induced helicity switching

The long-range communication of information, exemplified by signal transduction through membrane-bound receptors, is a central biochemical function. Reversible binding of a messenger ligand induces a local conformational change that is relayed through the receptor, inducing a chemical effect typically several nanometres from the binding site. We report a synthetic receptor mimic that transmits structural information from a boron-based ligand binding site to a spectroscopic reporter located more than 2&nbsp;nm away. Reversible binding of a diol ligand to the N-terminal binding site induces a screw-sense preference in a helical oligo(aminoisobutyric acid) foldamer, which is relayed to a reporter group at the remote C-terminus, communicating information about the structure and stereochemistry of the ligand. The reversible nature of boronate esterification was exploited to switch the receptor sequentially between left- and right-handed helices, while the exquisite conformational sensitivity of the helical relay allowed the reporter to differentiate even between purine and pyrimidine nucleosides as ligands. Biological receptors communicate information through ligand-induced conformational changes. A synthetic receptor with a boron-containing binding site that can selectively and reversibly complex a ligand (such as a purine nucleoside) is shown to function in a similar fashion. The resulting conformational change is relayed through the receptor, communicating structural information about the ligand to a spectroscopic reporter more than 2 nm away.

Simultaneous structure–activity studies and arming of natural products by C–H amination reveal cellular targets of eupalmerin acetate

Natural products have a venerable history of, and enduring potential for the discovery of useful biological activity. To fully exploit this, the development of chemical methodology that can functionalize unique sites within these complex structures is highly desirable. Here, we describe the use of rhodium(II)-catalysed C–H amination reactions developed by Du Bois to carry out simultaneous structure–activity relationship studies and arming (alkynylation) of natural products at ‘unfunctionalized’ positions. Allylic and benzylic C–H bonds in the natural products undergo amination while olefins undergo aziridination, and tertiary amine-containing natural products are converted to amidines by a C–H amination–oxidation sequence or to hydrazine sulfamate zwitterions by an unusual N-amination. The alkynylated derivatives are ready for conversion into cellular probes that can be used for mechanism-of-action studies. Chemo- and site-selectivity was studied with a diverse library of natural products. For one of these—the marine-derived anticancer diterpene, eupalmerin acetate—quantitative proteome profiling led to the identification of several protein targets in HL-60 cells, suggesting a polypharmacological mode of action. Natural products are enduring leads for exploring cell biology, yet structure–activity relationship studies and 'arming' of these small molecules for subsequent cellular probe synthesis remains a challenge. Here, a strategy for derivatization of natural products by C–H amination, aziridination and unusual N-aminations is described. Selective derivatization of eupalmarin acetate led to identification of this natural product's target.

Bifluoride-catalysed sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange reaction for the synthesis of polysulfates and polysulfonates

Polysulfates and polysulfonates possess exceptional mechanical properties making them potentially valuable engineering polymers. However, they have been little explored due to a lack of reliable synthetic access. Here we report bifluoride salts (Q+[FHF]–, where Q+ represents a wide range of cations) as powerful catalysts for the sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction between aryl silyl ethers and aryl fluorosulfates (or alkyl sulfonyl fluorides). The bifluoride salts are significantly more active in catalysing the SuFEx reaction compared to organosuperbases, therefore enabling much lower catalyst-loading (down to 0.05 mol%). Using this chemistry, we are able to prepare polysulfates and polysulfonates with high molecular weight, narrow polydispersity and excellent functional group tolerance. The process is practical with regard to the reduced cost of catalyst, polymer purification and by-product recycling. We have also observed that the process is not sensitive to scale-up, which is essential for its future translation from laboratory research to industrial applications. Both click chemistry and polymer synthesis require reliable transformations with high selectivity, efficiency and fidelity. Now, bifluoride salts can be used as powerful catalysts for the sufur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click reaction and they are applied to the synthesis of polysulfates and polysulfonates in a practical and scalable manner.

π-electron S = ½ quantum spin-liquid state in an ionic polyaromatic hydrocarbon

Molecular solids with cooperative electronic properties based purely on π electrons from carbon atoms offer a fertile ground in the search for exotic states of matter, including unconventional superconductivity and quantum magnetism. The field was ignited by reports of high-temperature superconductivity in materials obtained by the reaction of alkali metals with polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as phenanthrene and picene, but the composition and structure of any compound in this family remained unknown. Here we isolate the binary caesium salts of phenanthrene, Cs(C14H10) and Cs2(C14H10), to show that they are multiorbital strongly correlated Mott insulators. Whereas Cs2(C14H10) is diamagnetic because of orbital polarization, Cs(C14H10) is a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with a gapped spin-liquid state that emerges from the coupled highly frustrated Δ-chain magnetic topology of the alternating-exchange spiral tubes of S = ½ (C14H10)•− radical anions. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to 1.8 K (T/J ≈ 0.02; J is the dominant exchange constant) renders the compound an excellent candidate for a spin-½ quantum-spin liquid (QSL) that arises purely from carbon π electrons. Cooperative electronic properties that arise purely from carbon π-electrons can lead to unconventional superconductivity and quantum magnetism. New packing architectures have now been established in two caesium-intercalated polyaromatic hydrocarbons, CsPhenanthrene and Cs2Phenanthrene, both strongly correlated multi-orbital Mott insulators. The frustrated magnetic topology in CsPhenanthrene also renders it a spin-½ quantum spin liquid candidate.

An infrared spectroscopy approach to follow β-sheet formation in peptide amyloid assemblies

Amyloidogenic peptides and proteins play a crucial role in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These proteins undergo a spontaneous transition from a soluble, often partially folded form, into insoluble amyloid fibrils that are rich in β-sheets. Increasing evidence suggests that highly dynamic, polydisperse folding intermediates, which occur during fibril formation, are the toxic species in the amyloid-related diseases. Traditional condensed-phase methods are of limited use for characterizing these states because they typically only provide ensemble averages rather than information about individual oligomers. Here we report the first direct secondary-structure analysis of individual amyloid intermediates using a combination of ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry and gas-phase infrared spectroscopy. Our data reveal that oligomers of the fibril-forming peptide segments VEALYL and YVEALL, which consist of 4–9 peptide strands, can contain a significant amount of β-sheet. In addition, our data show that the more-extended variants of each oligomer generally exhibit increased β-sheet content. There is increasing evidence that highly dynamic, polydisperse peptide oligomers are the toxic species in amyloid-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Now, the secondary structure of individual amyloid oligomers has been analysed directly for the first time using a combination of ion-mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry and gas-phase infrared spectroscopy.

Oligomeric ferrocene rings

Cyclic oligomers comprising strongly interacting redox-active monomer units represent an unknown, yet highly desirable class of nanoscale materials. Here we describe the synthesis and properties of the first family of molecules belonging to this compound category—differently sized rings comprising only 1,1′-disubstituted ferrocene units (cyclo[n], n = 5–7, 9). Due to the close proximity and connectivity of centres (covalent Cp–Cp linkages; Cp = cyclopentadienyl) solution voltammograms exhibit well-resolved, separated 1e– waves. Theoretical interrogations into correlations based on ring size and charge state are facilitated using values of the equilibrium potentials of these transitions, as well as their relative spacing. As the interaction free energies between the redox centres scale linearly with overall ring charge and in conjunction with fast intramolecular electron transfer (∼107 s−1), these molecules can be considered as uniformly charged nanorings (diameter ∼1–2 nm). Cyclic molecules often exhibit unusual properties; consider for example the resonance stabilization energy of benzene or the strong cation binding of crown ethers. Now, a family of rings comprising varying numbers of directly linked ferrocenes has been prepared. These compounds are highly symmetric in solution and undergo rapid ‘oxidation-state isomerism’ when charged.

MoS2 monolayer catalyst doped with isolated Co atoms for the hydrodeoxygenation reaction

The conversion of oxygen-rich biomass into hydrocarbon fuels requires efficient hydrodeoxygenation catalysts during the upgrading process. However, traditionally prepared CoMoS2 catalysts, although efficient for hydrodesulfurization, are not appropriate due to their poor activity, sulfur loss and rapid deactivation at elevated temperature. Here, we report the synthesis of MoS2 monolayer sheets decorated with isolated Co atoms that bond covalently to sulfur vacancies on the basal planes that, when compared with conventionally prepared samples, exhibit superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrodeoxygenation of 4-methylphenol to toluene. This higher activity allows the reaction temperature to be reduced from the typically used 300 °C to 180 °C and thus allows the catalysis to proceed without sulfur loss and deactivation. Experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal a large number of sites at the interface between the Co and Mo atoms on the MoS2 basal surface and we ascribe the higher activity to the presence of sulfur vacancies that are created local to the observed Co–S–Mo interfacial sites. Converting oxygen-rich biomass into fuels requires the removal of oxygen groups through hydrodeoxygenation. MoS2 monolayer sheets decorated with isolated Co atoms bound to sulfur vacancies in the basal plane have now been synthesized that exhibit superior catalytic activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrodeoxygenation of 4-methylphenol to toluene when compared to conventionally prepared materials.

A sustainable catalytic pyrrole synthesis

The pyrrole heterocycle is a prominent chemical motif and is found widely in natural products, drugs, catalysts and advanced materials. Here we introduce a sustainable iridium-catalysed pyrrole synthesis in which secondary alcohols and amino alcohols are deoxygenated and linked selectively via the formation of C–N and C–C bonds. Two equivalents of hydrogen gas are eliminated in the course of the reaction, and alcohols based entirely on renewable resources can be used as starting materials. The catalytic synthesis protocol tolerates a large variety of functional groups, which includes olefins, chlorides, bromides, organometallic moieties, amines and hydroxyl groups. We have developed a catalyst that operates efficiently under mild conditions. Pyrroles are a highly important class of compounds with a wide variety of applications in biochemistry, pharmacy and materials science. Here, an iridium-catalysed synthesis of pyrroles is described, starting from renewable resources, alcohols that may be derived from lignocellulosic feedstocks and amino alcohols. The reaction proceeds by a condensation reaction that liberates two equivalents of hydrogen gas.

Cooperative activation of cyclobutanones and olefins leads to bridged ring systems by a catalytic [4 + 2] coupling

Bridged ring systems are widely found in natural products, and successful syntheses of them frequently feature intramolecular Diels–Alder reactions. These reactions are subclassified as either type I or type II depending on how the diene motif is tethered to the rest of the substrate (type I are tethered at the 1-position of the diene and type II at the 2-position). Although the type I reaction has been used with great success, the molecular scaffolds accessible by the type II reactions are limited by the strain inherent in the formation of an sp2 carbon at a bridgehead position. Here, we describe a complementary approach that provides access to these structures through the C–C activation of cyclobutanones and their coupling with olefins. Various alkenes have been coupled with cyclobutanones to provide a range of bridged skeletons. The ketone group of the products serves as a convenient handle for downstream functionalization. Although widely used to form bridged ring systems, certain intramolecular Diels–Alder reactions are hampered by the strain inherent in forming an sp2-carbon at a bridgehead position. Now, an alternative strategy has been described to access these bridged ring systems through the C–C activation and coupling of cyclobutanones with olefins.

Thiourea-catalysed ring opening of episulfonium ions with indole derivatives by means of stabilizing non-covalent interactions

Small organic and metal-containing molecules (molecular mass &lt;1,000) can catalyse synthetically useful reactions with the high levels of stereoselectivity typically associated with macromolecular enzymatic catalysts. Whereas enzymes are generally understood to accelerate reactions and impart selectivity as they stabilize specific transition structures through networks of cooperative interactions, enantioselectivity with chiral, small-molecule catalysts is rationalized typically by the steric destabilization of all but one dominant pathway. However, it is increasingly apparent that stabilizing effects also play an important role in small-molecule catalysis, although the mechanistic characterization of such systems is rare. Here, we show that arylpyrrolidino amido thiourea catalysts catalyse the enantioselective nucleophilic ring opening of episulfonium ions by indoles. Evidence is provided for the selective transition-state stabilization of the major pathway by the thiourea catalyst in the rate- and selectivity-determining step. Enantioselectivity is achieved through a network of attractive anion binding, cation-π and hydrogen-bond interactions between the catalyst and the reacting components in the transition-structure assembly. Arylpyrrolidino amidothiourea catalysts are shown to catalyse the enantioselective ring-opening of episulfonium ions by indole derivatives. Catalysis and enantioinduction are achieved by selective transition-state stabilization of the major pathway in the rate- and selectivity-determining step through a network of attractive anion-binding, cation–π and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the catalyst and the reacting partners.

Spatially resolved multicomponent gels

Multicomponent supramolecular systems could be used to prepare exciting new functional materials, but it is often challenging to control the assembly across multiple length scales. Here we report a simple approach to forming patterned, spatially resolved multicomponent supramolecular hydrogels. A multicomponent gel is first formed from two low-molecular-weight gelators and consists of two types of fibre, each formed by only one gelator. One type of fibre in this ‘self-sorted network’ is then removed selectively by a light-triggered gel-to-sol transition. We show that the remaining network has the same mechanical properties as it would have done if it initially formed alone. The selective irradiation of sections of the gel through a mask leads to the formation of patterned multicomponent networks, in which either one or two networks can be present at a particular position with a high degree of spatial control. Multicomponent supramolecular hydrogels have been prepared using a self-sorting mixture of two different gelators—one of which is photosensitive. Irradiation of the gels through a mask leads to the photosensitive network being selectively removed by a light-triggered gel-to-sol transition in a process that can be used to produce patterned gels with spatially controlled properties.

On the origin of the stability of graphene oxide membranes in water

Graphene oxide (GO) films are known to be highly stable in water and this property has made their use in membrane applications in solution possible. However, this state of affairs is somewhat counterintuitive because GO sheets become negatively charged on hydration and the membrane should disintegrate owing to electrostatic repulsion. We have now discovered a long-overlooked reason behind this apparent contradiction. Our findings show that neat GO membranes do, indeed, readily disintegrate in water, but the films become stable if they are crosslinked by multivalent cationic metal contaminants. Such metal contaminants can be introduced unintentionally during the synthesis and processing of GO, most notably on filtration with anodized aluminium oxide filter discs that corrode to release significant amounts of aluminium ions. This finding has wide implications in interpreting the processing–structure–property relationships of GO and other lamellar membranes. We also discuss strategies to avoid and mitigate metal contamination and demonstrate that this effect can be exploited to synthesize new membrane materials. Porous-alumina filter discs typically used to prepare graphene-oxide films are found to corrode during filtration and release aluminium ions that crosslink the negatively charged sheets and make the films insoluble in water. In contrast, aluminium-free graphene-oxide films are significantly weaker and readily disintegrate in water.

Adsorption-induced auto-amplification of enantiomeric excess on an achiral surface

The homochirality of biomolecules is a signature of life on Earth and has significant implications in, for example, the production of pharmaceutical compounds. It has been suggested that biomolecular homochirality may have arisen from the amplification of a spontaneously formed small enantiomeric excess (e.e.). Many minerals exhibit naturally chiral surfaces and so adsorption has been proposed as one possible mechanism for such an amplification of e.e. Here we show that when gas-phase mixtures of D- and L-aspartic acid are exposed to an achiral Cu(111) surface, a small e.e. in the gas phase, e.e.g, leads to an amplification of the e.e. on the surface, e.e.s, under equilibrium conditions. Adsorption-induced amplification of e.e. does not require a chiral surface. The dependence of e.e.s on e.e.g has been modelled successfully using a Langmuir-like adsorption isotherm that incorporates the formation of homochiral adsorbate clusters on the surface. Equilibrium adsorption of non-racemic mixtures of enantiomers onto an achiral surface is shown to lead to enantioenrichment by formation of homochiral clusters. Such auto-amplification must influence enantioselective processes such as heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption-based separations, and perhaps the processes that lead to the homochirality of life on Earth.

Optimization of a whole-cell biocatalyst by employing genetically encoded product sensors inside nanolitre reactors

Microcompartmentalization offers a high-throughput method for screening large numbers of biocatalysts generated from genetic libraries. Here we present a microcompartmentalization protocol for benchmarking the performance of whole-cell biocatalysts. Gel capsules served as nanolitre reactors (nLRs) for the cultivation and analysis of a library of Bacillus subtilis biocatalysts. The B. subtilis cells, which were co-confined with E. coli sensor cells inside the nLRs, converted the starting material cellobiose into the industrial product vitamin B2. Product formation triggered a sequence of reactions in the sensor cells: (1) conversion of B2 into flavin mononucleotide (FMN), (2) binding of FMN by a RNA riboswitch and (3) self-cleavage of RNA, which resulted in (4) the synthesis of a green fluorescent protein (GFP). The intensity of GFP fluorescence was then used to isolate B. subtilis variants that convert cellobiose into vitamin B2 with elevated efficiency. The underlying design principles of the assay are general and enable the development of similar protocols, which ultimately will speed up the optimization of whole-cell biocatalysts. A method for high-throughput analysis of whole-cell biocatalysts for industrial biotechnology has been developed. The process relies on a combination of specifically tailored bacterial sensor cells that are incubated with biocatalyst variants within nanolitre-sized compartments. The product is secreted by the whole-cell biocatalysts and taken up by the sensor cells, which initiates a sequence of reactions that finish with the synthesis of green fluorescent protein.

Title: 
Enantioselective synthesis of tatanans A–C and reinvestigation of their glucokinase-activating properties

The tatanans are members of a novel class of complex sesquilignan natural products recently isolated from the rhizomes of Acorus tatarinowii Schott plants. Tatanans A, B and C have previously been reported to have potent glucokinase-activating properties that exceed the in vitro activity of known synthetic antidiabetic agents. Here, using a series of sequential [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements, we report the total synthesis of tatanan A in 13 steps and 13% overall yield. We also complete a concise enantioselective total synthesis of more complex, atropisomeric tatanans B and C via a distinct convergent strategy based on a palladium-catalysed diastereotopic aromatic group differentiation (12 steps, 4% and 8% overall yield, respectively). A plausible biosynthetic relationship between acyclic tatanan A and spirocyclic tatanans B and C is proposed and probed experimentally. With sufficient quantities of the natural products in hand, we undertake a detailed functional characterization of the biological activities of tatanans A–C. Contrary to previous reports, our assays utilizing pure recombinant human enzyme demonstrate that tatanans do not function as allosteric activators of glucokinase. Tatanans A, B and C, members of a family of complex sesquilignan natural products, were recently reported to possess potent anti-diabetic, glucokinase-activating properties. Here, a convergent enantioselective total synthesis of these tatanans enabled by catalytic allylic dearomatization is described. Contrary to previous reports, biological assays show that tatanans A–C are not allosteric activators of glucokinase.

Bacteria clustering by polymers induces the expression of quorum-sensing-controlled phenotypes

Bacteria deploy a range of chemistries to regulate their behaviour and respond to their environment. Quorum sensing is one method by which bacteria use chemical reactions to modulate pre-infection behaviour such as surface attachment. Polymers that can interfere with bacterial adhesion or the chemical reactions used for quorum sensing are therefore a potential means to control bacterial population responses. Here, we report how polymeric ‘bacteria sequestrants’, designed to bind to bacteria through electrostatic interactions and therefore inhibit bacterial adhesion to surfaces, induce the expression of quorum-sensing-controlled phenotypes as a consequence of cell clustering. A combination of polymer and analytical chemistry, biological assays and computational modelling has been used to characterize the feedback between bacteria clustering and quorum sensing signalling. We have also derived design principles and chemical strategies for controlling bacterial behaviour at the population level. Bacteria use signalling networks to control population behaviour. Here it is shown that polymers that promote clustering of bacteria can influence bacterial signalling and induce unexpected responses in quorum-sensing-controlled phenotypes. These responses can be better modulated by controlling the affinity of the polymer to both bacteria and signalling molecules.

Title: 
Two-dimensional spectroscopy of a molecular dimer unveils the effects of vibronic coupling on exciton coherences

The observation of persistent oscillatory signals in multidimensional spectra of protein–pigment complexes has spurred a debate on the role of coherence-assisted electronic energy transfer as a key operating principle in photosynthesis. Vibronic coupling has recently been proposed as an explanation for the long lifetime of the observed spectral beatings. However, photosynthetic systems are inherently complicated, and tractable studies on simple molecular compounds are needed to fully understand the underlying physics. In this work, we present measurements and calculations on a solvated molecular homodimer with clearly resolvable oscillations in the corresponding two-dimensional spectra. Through analysis of the various contributions to the nonlinear response, we succeed in isolating the signal due to inter-exciton coherence. We find that although calculations predict a prolongation of this coherence due to vibronic coupling, the combination of dynamic disorder and vibrational relaxation leads to a coherence decay on a timescale comparable to the electronic dephasing time. The observation of long-lived coherent oscillations in the nonlinear spectra of photosynthetic proteins has raised significant discussion on the role of quantum effects in biology. Using a model system, the signatures of inter-exciton coherence have been isolated, which has allowed the influence of vibronic coupling to be studied in unprecedented detail.

Computational design of self-assembling cyclic protein homo-oligomers

Self-assembling cyclic protein homo-oligomers play important roles in biology, and the ability to generate custom homo-oligomeric structures could enable new approaches to probe biological function. Here we report a general approach to design cyclic homo-oligomers that employs a new residue-pair-transform method to assess the designability of a protein–protein interface. This method is sufficiently rapid to enable the systematic enumeration of cyclically docked arrangements of a monomer followed by sequence design of the newly formed interfaces. We use this method to design interfaces onto idealized repeat proteins that direct their assembly into complexes that possess cyclic symmetry. Of 96 designs that were characterized experimentally, 21 were found to form stable monodisperse homo-oligomers in solution, and 15 (four homodimers, six homotrimers, six homotetramers and one homopentamer) had solution small-angle X-ray scattering data consistent with the design models. X-ray crystal structures were obtained for five of the designs and each is very close to their corresponding computational model. A computational method to design cyclic protein homo-oligomers has been developed. Using this approach, a series of idealized repeat proteins incorporating designed interfaces that direct their assembly into complexes possessing cyclic symmetry were fabricated. 15 out of 96 oligomers that were characterized experimentally were shown to be consistent with the computational model.

Title: 
Structural and functional synthetic model of mono-iron hydrogenase featuring an anthracene scaffold

Mono-iron hydrogenase was the third type of hydrogenase discovered. Its Lewis acidic iron(II) centre promotes the heterolytic cleavage of the H–H bond and this non-redox H2 activation distinguishes it from the well-studied dinuclear [FeFe] and [NiFe] hydrogenases. Cleavage of the H–H bond is followed by hydride transfer to the enzyme's organic substrate, H4MPT+, which serves as a CO2 ‘carrier’ in methanogenic pathways. Here we report a scaffold-based synthetic approach by which to model mono-iron hydrogenase using an anthracene framework, which supports a biomimetic fac-C,N,S coordination motif to an iron(II) centre. This arrangement includes the biomimetic and organometallic Fe–C σ bond, which enables bidirectional activity reminiscent of the native enzyme: the complex activates H2 under mild conditions, and catalyses C–H hydride abstraction plus H2 generation from a model substrate. Notably, neither H2 activation nor C–H hydride abstraction was observed in the analogous complex with a pincer-type mer-C,N,S ligation, emphasizing the importance of the fac-C,N,S-iron(II) motif in promoting enzyme-like reactivity. Mono-iron hydrogenase promotes the heterolytic cleavage of H2 and subsequent hydride transfer to its organic substrate, H4MPT+, which serves as a CO2 ‘carrier’ in methanogenic pathways. Now, using an anthracene-scaffold-based approach, a synthetic model featuring enzyme-like Fe-C,N,S facial coordination has been developed. The model complex enables the bidirectional activity of H2 activation and evolution.

Title: 
Halogen-bonding-triggered supramolecular gel formation

Supramolecular gels are topical soft materials involving the reversible formation of fibrous aggregates using non-covalent interactions. There is significant interest in controlling the properties of such materials by the formation of multicomponent systems, which exhibit non-additive properties emerging from interaction of the components. The use of hydrogen bonding to assemble supramolecular gels in organic solvents is well established. In contrast, the use of halogen bonding to trigger supramolecular gel formation in a two-component gel (‘co-gel’) is essentially unexplored, and forms the basis for this study. Here, we show that halogen bonding between a pyridyl substituent in a bis(pyridyl urea) and 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene brings about gelation, even in polar media such as aqueous methanol and aqueous dimethylsulfoxide. This demonstrates that halogen bonding is sufficiently strong to interfere with competing gel-inhibitory interactions and create a ‘tipping point’ in gel assembly. Using this concept, we have prepared a halogen bond donor bis(urea) gelator that forms co-gels with halogen bond acceptors. Supramolecular gels whose properties can be tuned through non-covalent interactions — typically metal coordination or hydrogen bonding — are attracting attention in various fields. Researchers have now shown that halogen bonding is also strong enough to be relied on; it interferes with competitive, gel-inhibitory hydrogen bonding to induce co-gelation between two urea-based components.

Local epigenetic reprogramming induced by G-quadruplex ligands

DNA and histone modifications regulate transcriptional activity and thus represent valuable targets to reprogram the activity of genes. Current epigenetic therapies target the machinery that regulates these modifications, leading to global transcriptional reprogramming with the potential for extensive undesired effects. Epigenetic information can also be modified as a consequence of disrupting processive DNA replication. Here, we demonstrate that impeding replication by small-molecule-mediated stabilization of G-quadruplex nucleic acid secondary structures triggers local epigenetic plasticity. We report the use of the BU-1 locus of chicken DT40 cells to screen for small molecules able to induce G-quadruplex-dependent transcriptional reprogramming. Further characterization of the top hit compound revealed its ability to induce a dose-dependent inactivation of BU-1 expression in two steps: the loss of H3K4me3 and then subsequent DNA cytosine methylation, changes that were heritable across cell divisions even after the compound was removed. Targeting DNA secondary structures thus represents a potentially new approach for locus-specific epigenetic reprogramming. Delayed resolution of G-quadruplexes during replication can induce localized loss of epigenetic information and changes in gene expression. Now, this effect has been used to discover biologically potent G-quadruplex ligands and to demonstrate that G-quadruplex stabilization can induce epigenetic changes that are heritable across cell divisions even after the ligand is removed.

DNA brick crystals with prescribed depths

The ability to assemble functional materials with precise spatial arrangements is important for applications ranging from protein crystallography to photovoltaics. Here, we describe a general framework for constructing two-dimensional crystals with prescribed depths and sophisticated three-dimensional features. The crystals are self-assembled from single-stranded DNA components called DNA bricks. We demonstrate the experimental construction of DNA brick crystals that can grow to micrometre size in their lateral dimensions with precisely controlled depths up to 80 nm. They can be designed to pack DNA helices at angles parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the crystal and to display user-specified sophisticated three-dimensional nanoscale features, such as continuous or discontinuous cavities and channels. The programmed assembly of single DNA strands into bricks and ultimately micrometre-sized two-dimensional crystals with prescribed depths up to 80 nm is described. These crystals display intricate three-dimensional features including continuous or discontinuous cavities and channels with nanometre precision, and can pack DNA helices in parallel or perpendicularly to the plane of the crystals.

Title: 
Combining acid–base, redox and substrate binding functionalities to give a complete model for the [FeFe]-hydrogenase

Some enzymes function by coupling substrate turnover with electron transfer from a redox cofactor such as ferredoxin. In the [FeFe]-hydrogenases, nature's fastest catalysts for the production and oxidation of H2, the one-electron redox by a ferredoxin complements the one-electron redox by the diiron active site. In this Article, we replicate the function of the ferredoxins with the redox-active ligand Cp*Fe(C5Me4CH2PEt2) (FcP*). FcP* oxidizes at mild potentials, in contrast to most ferrocene-based ligands, which suggests that it might be a useful mimic of ferredoxin cofactors. The specific model is Fe2[(SCH2)2NBn](CO)3(FcP*)(dppv) (1), which contains the three functional components of the active site: a reactive diiron centre, an amine as a proton relay and, for the first time, a one-electron redox module. By virtue of the synthetic redox cofactor, [1]2+ exhibits unique reactivity towards hydrogen and CO. In the presence of excess oxidant and base, H2 oxidation by [1]2+ is catalytic. The fastest catalysts in nature for producing and oxidizing hydrogen are [FeFe]-hydrogenases, which make use of an extra one-electron redox equivalent from an iron-sulfur cluster that is outside the core. Now, a ferrocene-based ligand that oxidizes at mild potential performs this cluster's role in an excellent synthetic hydrogenase model.

Catalytic formal [2+2+1] synthesis of pyrroles from alkynes and diazenes via TiII/TiIV redox catalysis

Pyrroles are structurally important heterocycles. However, the synthesis of polysubstituted pyrroles is often challenging. Here, we report a multicomponent, Ti-catalysed formal [2+2+1] reaction of alkynes and diazenes for the oxidative synthesis of penta- and trisubstituted pyrroles: a nitrenoid analogue to classical Pauson–Khand-type syntheses of cyclopentenones. Given the scarcity of early transition-metal redox catalysis, preliminary mechanistic studies are presented. Initial stoichiometric and kinetic studies indicate that the mechanism of this reaction proceeds through a formally TiII/TiIV redox catalytic cycle, in which an azatitanacyclobutene intermediate, resulting from [2+2] alkyne + Ti imido coupling, undergoes a second alkyne insertion followed by reductive elimination to yield pyrrole and a TiII species. The key component for catalytic turnover is the reoxidation of the TiII species to a TiIV imido via the disproportionation of an η2-diazene-TiII complex. Pyrroles are a common substructure in pharmaceuticals, materials and natural products. Now a multicomponent, titanium-catalysed synthesis of polysubstituted pyrroles — a nitrenoid analogue of the Pauson–Khand reaction — is reported. Stoichiometric and kinetic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through an unusual TiII/TiIV redox cycle.

Combined biomass valorization and hydrogen production in a photoelectrochemical cell

In a typical hydrogen-producing photoelectrochemical cell (PEC), water reduction at the cathode (producing hydrogen) is accompanied by water oxidation at the anode (producing oxygen). This anode reaction is, however, not kinetically favourable. Here we investigate the possibility of utilizing solar energy for biomass conversion by performing the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) at the anode of a PEC. HMF is a key intermediate in biomass conversion, and FDCA is an important monomer for the production of numerous polymers. Using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl as a mediator, we obtained a near-quantitative yield and 100% Faradaic efficiency at ambient conditions without the use of precious-metal catalysts. This reaction is also thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable than water oxidation. Our results suggest that solar-driven biomass conversion can be a viable anode reaction that has the potential to increase both the efficiency and the utility of PECs constructed for solar-fuel production. Photoelectrochemical water-splitting produces hydrogen at the cathode and oxygen at the anode. The anode reaction is, however, kinetically unfavourable. Now, reduction of water at the cathode has been combined with oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural at the anode resulting in a photoelectrochemical cell that produces fuel and a useful platform chemical.

Chemoproteomic profiling and discovery of protein electrophiles in human cells

Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) serves as a chemical proteomic platform to discover and characterize functional amino acids in proteins on the basis of their enhanced reactivity towards small-molecule probes. This approach, to date, has mainly targeted nucleophilic functional groups, such as the side chains of serine and cysteine, using electrophilic probes. Here we show that ‘reverse-polarity’ (RP)-ABPP using clickable, nucleophilic hydrazine probes can capture and identify protein-bound electrophiles in cells. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the pyruvoyl cofactor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase (AMD1) is dynamically controlled by intracellular methionine concentrations. We also identify a heretofore unknown modification—an N-terminally bound glyoxylyl group—in the poorly characterized protein secernin-3. RP-ABPP thus provides a versatile method to monitor the metabolic regulation of electrophilic cofactors and discover novel types of electrophilic modifications on proteins in human cells. A chemical proteomic strategy is described for the discovery of protein-bound electrophilic groups in human cells. Using this approach, the dynamic regulation of the pyruvoyl catalytic cofactor in S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase was characterized and an N-terminal glyoxylyl modification on secernin proteins was discovered.

A soluble copper–bipyridine water-oxidation electrocatalyst

The oxidation of water to O2 is a key challenge in the production of chemical fuels from electricity. Although several catalysts have been developed for this reaction, substantial challenges remain towards the ultimate goal of an efficient, inexpensive and robust electrocatalyst. Reported here is the first copper-based catalyst for electrolytic water oxidation. Copper–bipyridine–hydroxo complexes rapidly form in situ from simple commercially available copper salts and bipyridine at high pH. Cyclic voltammetry of these solutions at pH 11.8–13.3 shows large, irreversible currents, indicative of catalysis. The production of O2 is demonstrated both electrochemically and with a fluorescence probe. Catalysis occurs at about 750&nbsp;mV overpotential. Electrochemical, electron paramagnetic resonance and other studies indicate that the catalyst is a soluble molecular species, that the dominant species in the catalytically active solutions is (2,2′-bipyridine)Cu(OH)2 and that this is among the most rapid homogeneous water-oxidation catalysts, with a turnover frequency of ~100&nbsp;s−1. Copper and bipyridine (bpy) self-assemble in aqueous solutions at high pH into an active electrocatalyst for the oxidation of water to O2, one of the great challenges in energy catalysis. These solutions contain primarily (bpy)Cu(OH)2, and are robust and active catalysts, albeit at high overpotentials.

Late-stage chemoselective functional-group manipulation of bioactive natural products with super-electrophilic silylium ions

The selective (and controllable) modification of complex molecules with disparate functional groups (for example, natural products) is a long-standing challenge that has been addressed using catalysts tuned to perform singular transformations (for example, C–H hydroxylation). A method whereby reactions with diverse functional groups within a single natural product are feasible depending on which catalyst or reagent is chosen would widen the possible structures one could obtain. Fluoroarylborane catalysts can heterolytically split Si–H bonds to yield an oxophilic silylium (R3Si+) equivalent along with a reducing (H–) equivalent. Together, these reactive intermediates enable the reduction of multiple functional groups. Exogenous phosphine Lewis bases further modify the catalyst speciation and attenuate aggressive silylium ions for the selective modification of complex natural products. Manipulation of the catalyst, silane reagent and the reaction conditions provides experimental control over which site is modified (and how). Applying this catalytic method to complex bioactive compounds (natural products or drugs) provides a powerful tool for studying structure–activity relationships. Determining the structure­–activity relationships for complex structures can be quite challenging, but it is often the method by which many natural products are optimized for use as drugs. Now, the combination of a fluoroaryl borane catalyst, a phosphine additive and a silane reducing agent enables the late-stage selective modification of complex bioactive natural products in order to provide rapid access to a wide array of structures, and therefore functions.

Reprogramming the assembly of unmodified DNA with a small molecule

The ability of DNA to store and encode information arises from base pairing of the four-letter nucleobase code to form a double helix. Expanding this DNA ‘alphabet’ by synthetic incorporation of new bases can introduce new functionalities and enable the formation of novel nucleic acid structures. However, reprogramming the self-assembly of existing nucleobases presents an alternative route to expand the structural space and functionality of nucleic acids. Here we report the discovery that a small molecule, cyanuric acid, with three thymine-like faces, reprogrammes the assembly of unmodified poly(adenine) (poly(A)) into stable, long and abundant fibres with a unique internal structure. Poly(A) DNA, RNA and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) all form these assemblies. Our studies are consistent with the association of adenine and cyanuric acid units into a hexameric rosette, which brings together poly(A) triplexes with a subsequent cooperative polymerization. Fundamentally, this study shows that small hydrogen-bonding molecules can be used to induce the assembly of nucleic acids in water, which leads to new structures from inexpensive and readily available materials. Cyanuric acid, a small molecule with three thymine-like faces, reprogrammes the assembly of unmodified poly(adenine) into long fibres with a unique internal structure. The association of adenine and cyanuric acid units into a hexameric rosette motif brings together poly(adenine) triplexes with subsequent cooperative polymerization.

Evidence that a ‘dynamic knockout’ in Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase does not affect the chemical step of catalysis

The question of whether protein motions play a role in the chemical step of enzymatic catalysis has generated much controversy in recent years. Debate has recently reignited over possible dynamic contributions to catalysis in dihydrofolate reductase, following conflicting conclusions from studies of the N23PP/S148A variant of the Escherichia coli enzyme. By investigating the temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects, we present evidence that the reduction in the hydride transfer rate constants in this variant is not a direct result of impairment of conformational fluctuations. Instead, the conformational state of the enzyme immediately before hydride transfer, which determines the electrostatic environment of the active site, affects the rate constant for the reaction. Although protein motions are clearly important for binding and release of substrates and products, there appears to be no detectable dynamic coupling of protein motions to the hydride transfer step itself. The connection between protein dynamics and catalysis is an issue of vigorous debate in enzymology. Conformational motions are known to be important for the physical steps in the catalytic cycle of dihydrofolate reductase, however, it is now reported that there is no evidence of a correlation between such motions and the actual chemical step, hydride transfer.

Controlling on-surface polymerization by hierarchical and substrate-directed growth

A key challenge in the field of nanotechnology, in particular in the design of molecular machines, novel materials or molecular electronics, is the bottom-up construction of covalently bound molecular architectures in a well-defined arrangement. To date, only rather simple structures have been obtained because of the limitation of one-step connection processes. Indeed, for the formation of sophisticated structures, step-by-step connection of molecules is required. Here, we present a strategy for the covalent connection of molecules in a hierarchical manner by the selective and sequential activation of specific sites, thereby generating species with a programmed reactivity. This approach leads to improved network quality and enables the fabrication of heterogeneous architectures with high selectivity. Furthermore, substrate-directed growth and a preferred orientation of the molecular nanostructures are achieved on an anisotropic surface. The demonstrated control over reactivity and diffusion during covalent bond formation constitutes a promising route towards the creation of sophisticated multi-component molecular nanostructures. The bottom-up construction of covalently linked molecular architectures on surfaces has recently been demonstrated, but only rather simple structures can be obtained in such one-step connection processes. A sequential approach has now been used to induce the selective connection of molecules with a programmed reactivity, enabling network formation with high selectivity.

Controlling activity and selectivity using water in the Au-catalysed preferential oxidation of CO in H2

Industrial hydrogen production through methane steam reforming exceeds 50 million tons annually and accounts for 2–5% of global energy consumption. The hydrogen product, even after processing by the water–gas shift, still typically contains ∼1% CO, which must be removed for many applications. Methanation (CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O) is an effective solution to this problem, but consumes 5–15% of the generated hydrogen. The preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO with O2 in hydrogen represents a more-efficient solution. Supported gold nanoparticles, with their high CO-oxidation activity and notoriously low hydrogenation activity, have long been examined as PROX catalysts, but have shown disappointingly low activity and selectivity. Here we show that, under the proper conditions, a commercial Au/Al2O3 catalyst can remove CO to below 10 ppm and still maintain an O2-to-CO2 selectivity of 80–90%. The key to maximizing the catalyst activity and selectivity is to carefully control the feed-flow rate and maintain one to two monolayers of water (a key CO-oxidation co-catalyst) on the catalyst surface. The preferential oxidation of CO is a potentially efficient means of purifying industrial hydrogen, however, no catalytic systems are known with sufficiently high activity and selectivity. Now Au/Al2O3 catalysts are shown to have outstanding activity and selectivity when both the feed flow-rate and the amount of surface water are carefully controlled.

Competition between model protocells driven by an encapsulated catalyst

The advent of Darwinian evolution required the emergence of molecular mechanisms for the heritable variation of fitness. One model for such a system involves competing protocell populations, each consisting of a replicating genetic polymer within a replicating vesicle. In this model, each genetic polymer imparts a selective advantage to its protocell by, for example, coding for a catalyst that generates a useful metabolite. Here, we report a partial model of such nascent evolutionary traits in a system that consists of fatty-acid vesicles containing a dipeptide catalyst, which catalyses the formation of a second dipeptide. The newly formed dipeptide binds to vesicle membranes, which imparts enhanced affinity for fatty acids and thus promotes vesicle growth. The catalysed dipeptide synthesis proceeds with higher efficiency in vesicles than in free solution, which further enhances fitness. Our observations suggest that, in a replicating protocell with an RNA genome, ribozyme-catalysed peptide synthesis might have been sufficient to initiate Darwinian evolution. Darwinian evolution involves competition between members of a population. Here, the synthesis of a hydrophobic dipeptide catalysed by a second dipeptide in a model protocell — a vesicle — is described. The reaction product partitions to the vesicle membrane, which grows by accumulating fatty acids derived from neighbouring vesicles. Thus, an encapsulated catalyst drives competition between the model protocells.

Genetically encoded reporters for hyperpolarized xenon magnetic resonance imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables high-resolution non-invasive observation of the anatomy and function of intact organisms. However, previous MRI reporters of key biological processes tied to gene expression have been limited by the inherently low molecular sensitivity of conventional 1H MRI. This limitation could be overcome through the use of hyperpolarized nuclei, such as in the noble gas xenon, but previous reporters acting on such nuclei have been synthetic. Here, we introduce the first genetically encoded reporters for hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI. These expressible reporters are based on gas vesicles (GVs), gas-binding protein nanostructures expressed by certain buoyant microorganisms. We show that GVs are capable of chemical exchange saturation transfer interactions with xenon, which enables chemically amplified GV detection at picomolar concentrations (a 100- to 10,000-fold improvement over comparable constructs for 1H MRI). We demonstrate the use of GVs as heterologously expressed indicators of gene expression and chemically targeted exogenous labels in MRI experiments performed on living cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of gene expression has been limited by the low molecular sensitivity of conventional 1H-MRI. To overcome this limitation, the first genetically encoded reporters for hyperpolarized xenon MRI have been developed. These expressible reporters, based on gas-filled protein nanostructures from buoyant microorganisms, are detectable at picomolar concentrations.

SnAP reagents for the one-step synthesis of medium-ring saturated N-heterocycles from aldehydes

Interest in saturated N-heterocycles as scaffolds for the synthesis of bioactive molecules is increasing. Reliable and predictable synthetic methods for the preparation of these compounds, especially medium-sized rings, are limited. We describe the development of SnAP (Sn amino protocol) reagents for the transformation of aldehydes into seven-, eight- and nine-membered saturated N-heterocycles. This process occurs under mild, room-temperature conditions and offers exceptional substrate scope and functional-group tolerance. Air- and moisture-stable SnAP reagents are prepared on a multigram scale from inexpensive starting materials by simple reaction sequences. These new reagents and processes allow widely available aryl, heteroaryl and aliphatic aldehydes to be converted into diverse N-heterocycles, including diazepanes, oxazepanes, diazocanes, oxazocanes and hexahydrobenzoxazonines, by a single synthetic operation. The availability of facile cross-coupling protocols is sometimes blamed for the high occurrence of ‘flat’ aromatic molecules in drug-screening collections. Here, reagents are described that make possible the one-step transformation of aldehydes into medium-ring saturated N-heterocycles. The methodology has exceptional substrate scope and functional group tolerance and provides a route to heterocycles not easily prepared by other methods.

Title: 
A broadly applicable [18F]trifluoromethylation of aryl and heteroaryl iodides for PET imaging

Molecules labelled with the unnatural isotope fluorine-18 are used for positron emission tomography. Currently, this molecular imaging technology is not exploited at its full potential because many 18F-labelled probes are inaccessible or notoriously difficult to produce. Typical challenges associated with 18F radiochemistry are the short half-life of 18F (&lt;2&nbsp;h), the use of sub-stoichiometric amounts of 18F, relative to the precursor and other reagents, as well as the limited availability of parent 18F sources of suitable reactivity ([18F]F– and [18F]F2). There is a high-priority demand for general methods allowing access to [18F]CF3-substituted molecules for application in pharmaceutical discovery programmes. We report the development of a process for the late-stage [18F]trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes from [18F]fluoride using commercially available reagents and (hetero)aryl iodides. This [18F]CuCF3–based protocol benefits from a large substrate scope and is characterized by its operational simplicity. Positron emission tomography imaging is an increasingly important technology in drug discovery and development, so there is an urgent need for logistically simple processes that allow access to [18F]CF3 (hetero)arenes. Here, a late-stage [18F]trifluoromethylation of (hetero)aryl iodides from [18F]fluoride and commercially available reagents is described, a process that relies on the in&nbsp;situ preparation of [18F]CuCF3.

New ligands for nickel catalysis from diverse pharmaceutical heterocycle libraries

Ligands are essential for controlling the reactivity and selectivity of reactions catalysed by transition metals. Access to large phosphine ligand libraries has become an essential tool for the application of metal-catalysed reactions industrially, but these existing libraries are not well suited to new catalytic methods based on non-precious metals (for example, Ni, Cu and Fe). The development of the requisite nitrogen- and oxygen-based ligand libraries lags far behind that of the phosphines and the development of new libraries is anticipated to be time consuming. Here we show that this process can be dramatically accelerated by mining for new ligands in a typical pharmaceutical compound library that is rich in heterocycles. Using this approach, we were able to screen a structurally diverse set of compounds with minimal synthetic effort and identify several new ligand classes for nickel-catalysed cross-electrophile coupling. These new ligands gave improved yields for challenging cross-couplings of pharmaceutically relevant substrates compared with those of those of previously published ligands. Pharmaceutical compound libraries are an essential part of drug discovery and the screening of libraries for new drug leads is routine. It has now been shown that these heterocycle-rich, diverse libraries can also be used for ligand discovery. The discovery and application of several new ligands to nickel-catalysed cross-electrophile coupling is demonstrated.

Conversion of alkanes to linear alkylsilanes using an iridium–iron-catalysed tandem dehydrogenation–isomerization–hydrosilylation

The conversion of inexpensive, saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks into value-added speciality chemicals using regiospecific, catalytic functionalization of alkanes is a major goal of organometallic chemistry. Linear alkylsilanes represent one such speciality chemical—they have a wide range of applications, including release coatings, silicone rubbers and moulding products. Direct, selective, functionalization of alkanes at primary C–H bonds is difficult and, to date, methods for catalytically converting alkanes into linear alkylsilanes are unknown. Here, we report a well-defined, dual-catalyst system for one-pot, two-step alkane silylations. The system comprises a pincer-ligated Ir catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation and an Fe catalyst that effects a subsequent tandem olefin isomerization–hydrosilylation. This method exhibits exclusive regioselectivity for the production of terminally functionalized alkylsilanes. This dual-catalyst strategy has also been applied to regioselective alkane borylations to form linear alkylboronate esters. The selective conversion of abundant and inexpensive alkane feedstocks into value-added speciality chemicals is a significant and challenging goal, and methods for catalytically converting alkanes into useful linear alkylsilanes are unknown, to date. Now, a strategy combining alkane dehydrogenation with regioselective olefin isomerization–hydrosilylation to produce linear alkylsilanes is described.

Title: 
CO- and HCl-free synthesis of acid chlorides from unsaturated hydrocarbons via shuttle catalysis

The synthesis of carboxylic acid derivatives from unsaturated hydrocarbons is an important process for the preparation of polymers, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and agrochemicals. Despite its industrial relevance, the traditional Reppe-type carbonylation reaction using pressurized CO is of limited applicability to laboratory-scale synthesis because of: (1) the safety hazards associated with the use of CO, (2) the need for special equipment to handle pressurized gas, (3) the low reactivity of several relevant nucleophiles and (4) the necessity to employ different, often tailor-made, catalytic systems for each nucleophile. Herein we demonstrate that a shuttle-catalysis approach enables a CO- and HCl-free transfer process between an inexpensive reagent, butyryl chloride, and a wide range of unsaturated substrates to access the corresponding acid chlorides in good yields. This new transformation provides access to a broad range of carbonyl-containing products through the in situ transformation of the reactive acid chloride intermediate. In a broader context, this work demonstrates that isodesmic shuttle-catalysis reactions can unlock elusive catalytic reactions. Previous methods to transform unsaturated substrates into carbonyl-containing products have generally relied on the use of hazardous carbon monoxide and tailor-made catalysts for each nucleophile employed. Now, shuttle catalysis can be used to perform a CO- and HCl-free transfer hydrochlorocarbonylation to access acid chlorides that can be transformed in situ into virtually any carbonyl-containing product.

Conformer-specific hydrogen atom tunnelling in trifluoromethylhydroxycarbene

Conformational control of organic reactions is at the heart of the biomolecular sciences. To achieve a particular reactivity, one of many conformers may be selected, for instance, by a (bio)catalyst, as the geometrically most suited and appropriately reactive species. The equilibration of energetically close-lying conformers is typically assumed to be facile and less energetically taxing than the reaction under consideration itself: this is termed the ‘Curtin–Hammett principle’. Here, we show that the trans conformer of trifluoromethylhydroxycarbene preferentially rearranges through a facile quantum-mechanical hydrogen tunnelling pathway, while its cis conformer is entirely unreactive. Hence, this presents the first example of a conformer-specific hydrogen tunnelling reaction. The Curtin–Hammett principle is not applicable, due to the high barrier between the two conformers. Control over the selectivity of chemical reactions and biological molecules requires an intimate understanding of how conformation impacts reactivity. It is now shown that the trans conformer of trifluoromethylhydroxycarbene preferentially rearranges through a quantum-mechanical hydrogen-tunnelling pathway, whereas its cis conformer is unreactive.

Title: 
Solvating additives drive solution-mediated electrochemistry and enhance toroid growth in non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries

Given their high theoretical specific energy, lithium–oxygen batteries have received enormous attention as possible alternatives to current state-of-the-art rechargeable Li–ion batteries. However, the maximum discharge capacity in non-aqueous lithium–oxygen batteries is limited to a small fraction of its theoretical value due to the build-up of insulating lithium peroxide (Li2O2), the battery’s primary discharge product. The discharge capacity can be increased if Li2O2 forms as large toroidal particles rather than as a thin conformal layer. Here, we show that trace amounts of electrolyte additives, such as H2O, enhance the formation of Li2O2 toroids and result in significant improvements in capacity. Our experimental observations and a growth model show that the solvating properties of the additives prompt a solution-based mechanism that is responsible for the growth of Li2O2 toroids. We present a general formalism describing an additive’s tendency to trigger the solution process, providing a rational design route for electrolytes that afford larger lithium–oxygen battery capacities. The maximum attainable capacity of the Li–O2 battery is limited by the passivation of its cathode by electronically insulating Li2O2. It is now shown that electrolyte additives, which activate solution-mediated growth of Li2O2, make it possible to circumvent this fundamental limitation, leading to design rules for additive selection.

Title: 
Catalytic asymmetric carbon–carbon bond formation using alkenes as alkylmetal equivalents

Catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition reactions with organometallic reagents are powerful reactions in synthetic chemistry. Procedures that use non-stabilized carbanions have been developed extensively, but these suffer from a number of limitations that prevent their use in many situations. Here, we report that alkylmetal species generated in situ from alkenes can be used in highly enantioselective 1,4-addition initiated by a copper catalyst. Using alkenes as starting materials is desirable because they are readily available and have favourable properties when compared to pre-made organometallics. High levels of enantioselectivity are observed at room temperature in a range of solvents, and the reaction tolerates functional groups that are not compatible with comparable methods—a necessary prerequisite for efficient and protecting-group-free strategies for synthesis. Organometallic reagents are widely used as nucleophiles in asymmetric catalysis. Here, alkylmetal species generated in situ by hydrometallation of alkenes are used in enantioselective copper-catalysed C–C bond formation. The process is formally an asymmetric reductive coupling of an alkene to an enone, and tolerates many functional groups.

Title: 
Membraneless organelles can melt nucleic acid duplexes and act as biomolecular filters

Membraneless organelles are cellular compartments made from drops of liquid protein inside a cell. These compartments assemble via the phase separation of disordered regions of proteins in response to changes in the cellular environment and the cell cycle. Here we demonstrate that the solvent environment within the interior of these cellular bodies behaves more like an organic solvent than like water. One of the most-stable biological structures known, the DNA double helix, can be melted once inside the liquid droplet, and simultaneously structures formed from regulatory single-stranded nucleic acids are stabilized. Moreover, proteins are shown to have a wide range of absorption or exclusion from these bodies, and can act as importers for otherwise-excluded nucleic acids, which suggests the existence of a protein-mediated trafficking system. A common strategy in organic chemistry is to utilize different solvents to influence the behaviour of molecules and reactions. These results reveal that cells have also evolved this capability by exploiting the interiors of membraneless organelles. Membraneless organelles form as liquid droplets inside cells. These bodies are effectively a separate organic phase, with unique biochemical properties. Now, the solvent interior of membraneless organelles has been shown to have a significant effect on the properties and structure of biomolecules. In addition to selectively partitioning and trafficking proteins, they can melt DNA without using ATP.

Title: 
Switchable photooxygenation catalysts that sense higher-order amyloid structures

Proteins can misfold into amyloid structures that are associated with diseases; however, the same proteins often have important biological roles. To degrade selectively the amyloid form without affecting the fraction of functional protein is, therefore, an attractive goal. Here we report target-state-dependent photooxygenation catalysts that are active only when bound to the cross-β-sheet structure that is characteristic of pathogenic aggregated amyloid proteins. We show these catalysts can selectively oxygenate the amyloid form of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) 1–42 in the presence of non-amyloid off-target substrates. Furthermore, photooxygenation with a catalyst that bears an Aβ-binding peptide attenuated the Aβ pathogenicity in the presence of cells. We also show that selective photooxygenation is generally applicable to other amyloidogenic proteins (amylin, insulin, β2-microglobulin, transthyretin and α-synuclein) and does not affect the physiologically functional non-aggregate states of these proteins. This is the first report of an artificial catalyst that can be selectively and reversibly turned on and off depending on the structure and aggregation state of the substrate protein. Selectively degrading the pathogenic, aggregated amyloid state of proteins, without affecting the functional state, is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating amyloid diseases. Now, photooxygenation catalysts that are active only when bound to the cross-β-sheet structure of the amyloid form have been developed.

Amyloid β-sheet mimics that antagonize protein aggregation and reduce amyloid toxicity

The amyloid protein aggregation associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and type II diabetes (among many others) features a bewildering variety of β-sheet-rich structures in transition from native proteins to ordered oligomers and fibres. The variation in the amino-acid sequences of the β-structures presents a challenge to developing a model system of β-sheets for the study of various amyloid aggregates. Here, we introduce a family of robust β-sheet macrocycles that can serve as a platform to display a variety of heptapeptide sequences from different amyloid proteins. We have tailored these amyloid β-sheet mimics (ABSMs) to antagonize the aggregation of various amyloid proteins, thereby reducing the toxicity of amyloid aggregates. We describe the structures and inhibitory properties of ABSMs containing amyloidogenic peptides from the amyloid-β peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease, β2-microglobulin associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis, α-synuclein associated with Parkinson's disease, islet amyloid polypeptide associated with type II diabetes, human and yeast prion proteins, and Tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangles. A family of robust β-sheet macrocycles that can display a variety of heptapeptide sequences from different amyloid proteins is introduced. These amyloid β-sheet mimics can be tailored to antagonize aggregation of the proteins, thereby reducing the toxicity associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Title: 
A molecular shuttle that operates inside a metal–organic framework

A ‘molecular shuttle’ is an interlocked molecular assembly in which a macrocyclic ring is able to move back and forth between two recognition sites. This large-amplitude translational motion was first characterized in solution in 1991. Since that report, many mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have been designed, synthesized and shown to mimic the complex functions of macroscopic switches and machines. Here, we show that this fundamental concept—the translational motion of a molecular shuttle—can be organized, initiated and made to operate inside a crystalline, solid-state material. A metal–organic framework (MOF) designated UWDM-4 was prepared that contains a rigid linker that is a molecular shuttle. It was demonstrated by variable-temperature 1H-13C cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) and 13C 2D exchange correlation spectroscopy (EXSY) solid-state NMR at 21.1 T on a 13C-enriched sample that the macrocyclic ring undergoes rapid shuttling along the rigid axle built between struts of the framework. The piston-like, translational motion of a molecular shuttle — a process that is fundamental to many mechanically interlocked molecular switches and machines — has now been demonstrated to occur inside the highly organized and dense structure (containing approximately 1021 shuttles per cm3) of a metal–organic framework material.

In situ solid-state NMR and XRD studies of the ADOR process and the unusual structure of zeolite IPC-6

The assembly–disassembly–organization–reassembly (ADOR) mechanism is a recent method for preparing inorganic framework materials and, in particular, zeolites. This flexible approach has enabled the synthesis of isoreticular families of zeolites with unprecedented continuous control over porosity, and the design and preparation of materials that would have been difficult—or even impossible—to obtain using traditional hydrothermal techniques. Applying the ADOR process to a parent zeolite with the UTL framework topology, for example, has led to six previously unknown zeolites (named IPC-n, where n = 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10). To realize the full potential of the ADOR method, however, a further understanding of the complex mechanism at play is needed. Here, we probe the disassembly, organization and reassembly steps of the ADOR process through a combination of in situ solid-state NMR spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction experiments. We further use the insight gained to explain the formation of the unusual structure of zeolite IPC-6. The assembly–disassembly–organization–reassembly (ADOR) process has recently enabled the synthesis of unusual — and sometimes previously inaccessible — inorganic materials. Further insight into its complex mechanism has now been gained that explains the unexpected formation and structure of such a zeolite.

Accelerated chemistry in the reaction between the hydroxyl radical and methanol at interstellar temperatures facilitated by tunnelling

Understanding the abundances of molecules in dense interstellar clouds requires knowledge of the rates of gas-phase reactions between uncharged species. However, because of the low temperatures within these clouds, reactions with an activation barrier were considered too slow to play an important role. Here we show that, despite the presence of a barrier, the rate coefficient for the reaction between the hydroxyl radical (OH) and methanol—one of the most abundant organic molecules in space—is almost two orders of magnitude larger at 63&nbsp;K than previously measured at ∼200&nbsp;K. We also observe the formation of the methoxy radical product, which was recently detected in space. These results are interpreted by the formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex that is sufficiently long-lived to undergo quantum-mechanical tunnelling to form products. We postulate that this tunnelling mechanism for the oxidation of organic molecules by OH is widespread in low-temperature interstellar environments. In interstellar clouds, reactions that have an activation barrier have previously been considered too slow to be significant because of the low temperatures experienced. However, large enhancements in the rate coefficient for the reaction of OH with methanol have now been observed at temperatures below 100&nbsp;K. A mechanism involving tunnelling has been proposed.

On-surface generation and imaging of arynes by atomic force microscopy

Reactive intermediates are involved in many chemical transformations. However, their characterization is a great challenge because of their short lifetimes and high reactivities. Arynes, formally derived from arenes by the removal of two hydrogen atoms from adjacent carbon atoms, are prominent reactive intermediates that have been hypothesized for more than a century. Their rich chemistry enables a widespread use in synthetic chemistry, as they are advantageous building blocks for the construction of polycyclic compounds that contain aromatic rings. Here, we demonstrate the generation and characterization of individual polycyclic aryne molecules on an ultrathin insulating film by means of low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Bond-order analysis suggests that a cumulene resonance structure is the dominant one, and the aryne reactivity is preserved at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide important insights into the chemistry of these elusive intermediates and their potential application in the field of on-surface synthesis. Based initially on the outcome of certain reactions but later backed up by spectroscopic evidence, chemists have proposed — for more than a century — the existence of arynes as extremely reactive intermediates in chemical transformations. Now, with the help of atomic force microscopy, it is finally possible to generate and directly visualize this elusive intermediate.

Title: 
Synthetic ion transporters can induce apoptosis by facilitating chloride anion transport into cells

Anion transporters based on small molecules have received attention as therapeutic agents because of their potential to disrupt cellular ion homeostasis. However, a direct correlation between a change in cellular chloride anion concentration and cytotoxicity has not been established for synthetic ion carriers. Here we show that two pyridine diamide-strapped calix[4]pyrroles induce coupled chloride anion and sodium cation transport in both liposomal models and cells, and promote cell death by increasing intracellular chloride and sodium ion concentrations. Removing either ion from the extracellular media or blocking natural sodium channels with amiloride prevents this effect. Cell experiments show that the ion transporters induce the sodium chloride influx, which leads to an increased concentration of reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and apoptosis via caspase activation. However, they do not activate the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway associated with the apoptosis-inducing factor. Ion transporters, therefore, represent an attractive approach for regulating cellular processes that are normally controlled tightly by homeostasis. Anion transporters that disrupt cellular ion homeostasis could represent a new approach for generating therapeutic lead compounds. Now, two pyridine diamide-strapped calix[4]pyrroles have been shown to induce coupled chloride anion and sodium cation transport in liposomal models and cells. These compounds promote cell death by increasing intracellular chloride and sodium ion concentrations.

Direct observation of the collapse of the delocalized excess electron in water

It is generally assumed that the hydrated electron occupies a quasi-spherical cavity surrounded by only a few water molecules in its equilibrated state. However, in the very moment of its generation, before water has had time to respond to the extra charge, it is expected to be significantly larger in size. According to a particle-in-a-box picture, the frequency of its absorption spectrum is a sensitive measure of the initial size of the electronic wavefunction. Here, using transient terahertz spectroscopy, we show that the excess electron initially absorbs in the far-infrared at a frequency for which accompanying ab initio molecular dynamics simulations estimate an initial delocalization length of ≈40 Å. The electron subsequently shrinks due to solvation and thereby leaves the terahertz observation window very quickly, within ≈200 fs. It is generally believed that, after being generated, an excess electron in water shrinks from a strongly delocalized to a localized state in about a picosecond. Now, these early stages in the behaviour of this electron have been observed using a combination of transient THz spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.

Title: 
Latent analysis of unmodified biomolecules and their complexes in solution with attomole detection sensitivity

The study of biomolecular interactions is central to an understanding of function, malfunction and therapeutic modulation of biological systems, yet often involves a compromise between sensitivity and accuracy. Many conventional analytical steps and the procedures required to facilitate sensitive detection, such as the incorporation of chemical labels, are prone to perturb the complexes under observation. Here we present a ‘latent’ analysis approach that uses chemical and microfluidic tools to reveal, through highly sensitive detection of a labelled system, the behaviour of the physiologically relevant unlabelled system. We implement this strategy in a native microfluidic diffusional sizing platform, allowing us to achieve detection sensitivity at the attomole level, determine the hydrodynamic radii of biomolecules that vary by over three orders of magnitude in molecular weight, and study heterogeneous mixtures. We illustrate these key advantages by characterizing a complex of an antibody domain in the solution phase and under physiologically relevant conditions. Labelling biomolecules to improve the sensitivity of analysis can perturb their interactions. Now, microfluidic and chemical tools have been used to allow simple, sensitive detection of a labelled system to reveal the behaviour of the native and physiologically relevant unlabelled system. The system was used to characterize the solution-phase behaviour of a clinically relevant protein–protein interaction.

Asymmetric silver-catalysed intermolecular bromotrifluoromethoxylation of alkenes with a new trifluoromethoxylation reagent

Fluorinated organic compounds are becoming increasingly important in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials science. The introduction of trifluoromethoxy groups into new drugs and agrochemicals has attracted much attention due to their strongly electron-withdrawing nature and high lipophilicity. However, synthesis of trifluoromethoxylated organic molecules is difficult owing to the decomposition of trifluoromethoxide anion and β-fluoride elimination from transition-metal–trifluoromethoxide complexes, and no catalytic enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation reaction has been reported until now. Here, we present an example of an asymmetric silver-catalysed intermolecular bromotrifluoromethoxylation of alkenes with trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS) as a new trifluoromethoxylation reagent. Compared to other trifluoromethoxylation reagents, TFMS is easily prepared and thermally stable with good reactivity. In addition, this reaction is operationally simple, scalable and proceeds under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, broad scope and good functional group compatibility has been demonstrated by application of the method to the bromotrifluoromethoxylation of double bonds in natural products and natural product derivatives. The first example of an asymmetric silver-catalysed intermolecular bromotrifluoromethoxylation of alkenes has been described with trifluoromethyl aryl sulfonate as a new trifluoromethoxylation reagent. This reaction is operationally simple, scalable and proceeds under mild reaction conditions, which can be applied to the late-stage trifluoromethoxylation of complex small molecules.

Title: 
Ammonia formation by a thiolate-bridged diiron amide complex as a nitrogenase mimic

Although nitrogenase enzymes routinely convert molecular nitrogen into ammonia under ambient temperature and pressure, this reaction is currently carried out industrially using the Haber–Bosch process, which requires extreme temperatures and pressures to activate dinitrogen. Biological fixation occurs through dinitrogen and reduced NxHy species at multi-iron centres of compounds bearing sulfur ligands, but it is difficult to elucidate the mechanistic details and to obtain stable model intermediate complexes for further investigation. Metal-based synthetic models have been applied to reveal partial details, although most models involve a mononuclear system. Here, we report a diiron complex bridged by a bidentate thiolate ligand that can accommodate HN=NH. Following reductions and protonations, HN=NH is converted to NH3 through pivotal intermediate complexes bridged by N2H3– and NH2– species. Notably, the final ammonia release was effected with water as the proton source. Density functional theory calculations were carried out, and a pathway of biological nitrogen fixation is proposed. Although it is achieved routinely by nitrogenases, the conversion of molecular dinitrogen into ammonia under ambient conditions is proving difficult with synthetic systems. A thiolate-bridged diiron complex has now been developed that produces ammonia from coordinated N2H2 through a sequence of reduction and protonation reactions that may well mimic the biological nitrogen fixation.

Title: 
Engineering methylaspartate ammonia lyase for the asymmetric synthesis of unnatural amino acids

The redesign of enzymes to produce catalysts for a predefined transformation remains a major challenge in protein engineering. Here, we describe the structure-based engineering of methylaspartate ammonia lyase (which in nature catalyses the conversion of 3-methylaspartate to ammonia and 2-methylfumarate) to accept a variety of substituted amines and fumarates and catalyse the asymmetric synthesis of aspartic acid derivatives. We obtained two single-active-site mutants, one exhibiting a wide nucleophile scope including structurally diverse linear and cyclic alkylamines and one with broad electrophile scope including fumarate derivatives with alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio and arylthio substituents at the C2 position. Both mutants have an enlarged active site that accommodates the new substrates while retaining the high stereo- and regioselectivity of the wild-type enzyme. As an example, we demonstrate a highly enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of threo-3-benzyloxyaspartate (an important inhibitor of neuronal excitatory glutamate transporters in the brain). Substituted aspartic acids are highly valuable as tools for biological research and as chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals. Here, engineering of the enzyme methylaspartate ammonia lyase to accept a large variety of substituted amines and fumarates and catalyse the asymmetric synthesis of aspartic acid derivatives is described.

A unifying paradigm for naphthoquinone-based meroterpenoid (bio)synthesis

Bacterial meroterpenoids constitute an important class of natural products with diverse biological properties and therapeutic potential. The biosynthetic logic for their production is unknown and defies explanation via classical biochemical paradigms. A large subgroup of naphthoquinone-based meroterpenoids exhibits a substitution pattern of the polyketide-derived aromatic core that seemingly contradicts the established reactivity pattern of polyketide phenol nucleophiles and terpene diphosphate electrophiles. We report the discovery of a hitherto unprecedented enzyme-promoted α-hydroxyketone rearrangement catalysed by vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases to account for these discrepancies in the merochlorin and napyradiomycin class of meroterpenoid antibiotics, and we demonstrate that the α-hydroxyketone rearrangement is potentially a conserved biosynthetic reaction in this molecular class. The biosynthetic α-hydroxyketone rearrangement was applied in a concise total synthesis of naphthomevalin, a prominent member of the napyradiomycin meroterpenes, and sheds further light on the mechanism of this unifying enzymatic transformation. Bacterial naphthoquinone meroterpenoid natural products defy biosynthetic logic via classical biochemical paradigms. Now, an enzyme promoted α-hydroxyketone rearrangement catalysed by vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases reveals a conserved biosynthetic reaction in this molecular class that further has inspired a concise biomimetic synthesis of naphthomevalin, a prominent member of the napyradiomycin meroterpenes.

A ring-distortion strategy to construct stereochemically complex and structurally diverse compounds from natural products

High-throughput screening is the dominant method used to identify lead compounds in drug discovery. As such, the makeup of screening libraries largely dictates the biological targets that can be modulated and the therapeutics that can be developed. Unfortunately, most compound-screening collections consist principally of planar molecules with little structural or stereochemical complexity, compounds that do not offer the arrangement of chemical functionality necessary for the modulation of many drug targets. Here we describe a novel, general and facile strategy for the creation of diverse compounds with high structural and stereochemical complexity using readily available natural products as synthetic starting points. We show through the evaluation of chemical properties (which include fraction of sp3 carbons, ClogP and the number of stereogenic centres) that these compounds are significantly more complex and diverse than those in standard screening collections, and we give guidelines for the application of this strategy to any suitable natural product. An approach for the construction of complex and diverse compound libraries is described, whereby natural products are altered through a series of ring system distortion reactions. The compounds produced have markedly different physiochemical properties from those in standard screening collections and thus could offer advantages in the search for lead molecules that can be developed into drug candidates.

Highly efficient catalysis of the Kemp elimination in the cavity of a cubic coordination cage

The hollow cavities of coordination cages can provide an environment for enzyme-like catalytic reactions of small-molecule guests. Here, we report a new example (catalysis of the Kemp elimination reaction of benzisoxazole with hydroxide to form 2-cyanophenolate) in the cavity of a water-soluble M8L12 coordination cage, with two features of particular interest. First, the rate enhancement is among the largest observed to date: at pD 8.5, the value of kcat/kuncat is 2 × 105, due to the accumulation of a high concentration of partially desolvated hydroxide ions around the bound guest arising from ion-pairing with the 16+ cage. Second, the catalysis is based on two orthogonal interactions: (1) hydrophobic binding of benzisoxazole in the cavity and (2) polar binding of hydroxide ions to sites on the cage surface, both of which were established by competition experiments. The Kemp elimination has been catalysed in the cavity of a coordination cage with a rate enhancement (kcat/kuncat) of 200,000 at pD 8.5. The catalysis requires two orthogonal interactions to bring together the components: hydrophobic binding of benzisoxazole, and accumulation of hydroxide ions at the cationic cage surface by ion-pairing.

Ligand-enabled cross-coupling of C(sp3)–H bonds with arylboron reagents via Pd(II)/Pd(0) catalysis

There have been numerous developments in C–H activation reactions in the past decade. Attracted by the ability to functionalize molecules directly at ostensibly unreactive C–H bonds, chemists have discovered reaction conditions that enable reactions of C(sp2)–H and C(sp3)–H bonds with a variety of coupling partners. Despite these advances, the development of suitable ligands that enable catalytic C(sp3)–H bond functionalization remains a significant challenge. Herein we report the discovery of a mono-N-protected amino acid ligand that enables Pd(II)-catalysed coupling of γ-C(sp3)–H bonds in triflyl-protected amines with arylboron reagents. Remarkably, no background reaction was observed in the absence of ligand. A variety of amine substrates and arylboron reagents were cross-coupled using this method. Arylation of optically active substrates derived from amino acids also provides a potential route for preparing non-proteinogenic amino acids. Despite advances in C–H activation reactions in the past decade, the development of suitable ligands that enable catalytic C(sp3)–H bond functionalization remains a significant challenge. Here, the discovery of a mono-N-protected amino acid ligand enables Pd(II)-catalysed cross-coupling of C(sp3)–H bonds in triflyl-protected amines with arylboron reagents.

Side-chain control of porosity closure in single- and multiple-peptide-based porous materials by cooperative folding

Porous materials are attractive for separation and catalysis—these applications rely on selective interactions between host materials and guests. In metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), these interactions can be controlled through a flexible structural response to the presence of guests. Here we report a MOF that consists of glycyl–serine dipeptides coordinated to metal centres, and has a structure that evolves from a solvated porous state to a desolvated non-porous state as a result of ordered cooperative, displacive and conformational changes of the peptide. This behaviour is driven by hydrogen bonding that involves the side-chain hydroxyl groups of the serine. A similar cooperative closure (reminiscent of the folding of proteins) is also displayed with multipeptide solid solutions. For these, the combination of different sequences of amino acids controls the framework's response to the presence of guests in a nonlinear way. This functional control can be compared to the effect of single-point mutations in proteins, in which exchange of single amino acids can radically alter structure and function. A family of dipeptide-based metal–organic frameworks has been shown to respond to the presence of guests in a cooperative manner controlled by one amino acid residue. When the linker features a serine residue, guest removal enables the formation of hydrogen bonds between the residue's side-chains, causing a conformational change that closes the MOF's porous domain.

A steric tethering approach enables palladium-catalysed C–H activation of primary amino alcohols

Aliphatic primary amines are a class of chemical feedstock essential to the synthesis of higher-order nitrogen-containing molecules, commonly found in biologically active compounds and pharmaceutical agents. New methods for the construction of complex amines remain a continuous challenge to synthetic chemists. Here, we outline a general palladium-catalysed strategy for the functionalization of aliphatic C–H bonds within amino alcohols, an important class of small molecule. Central to this strategy is the temporary conversion of catalytically incompatible primary amino alcohols into hindered secondary amines that are capable of undergoing a sterically promoted palladium-catalysed C–H activation. Furthermore, a hydrogen bond between amine and catalyst intensifies interactions around the palladium and orients the aliphatic amine substituents in an ideal geometry for C–H activation. This catalytic method directly transforms simple, easily accessible amines into highly substituted, functionally concentrated and structurally diverse products, and can streamline the synthesis of biologically important amine-containing molecules. The functionalization of primary amines by C–H activation is often hindered by their strong metal-coordinating properties. Now, a steric tethering approach — which temporarily converts amino alcohols into hindered secondary amines — has been developed. The approach allows these amino alcohols to be transformed into structurally complex and diverse products using palladium-catalysed aliphatic C–H activation.

Inducing and quantifying forbidden reactivity with single-molecule polymer mechanochemistry

Forbidden reactions, such as those that violate orbital symmetry effects as captured in the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, remain an ongoing challenge for experimental characterization, because when the competing allowed pathway is available the reactions are intrinsically difficult to trigger. Recent developments in covalent mechanochemistry have opened the door to activating otherwise inaccessible reactions. Here we report single-molecule force spectroscopy studies of three mechanically induced reactions along both their symmetry-allowed and symmetry-forbidden pathways, which enables us to quantify just how ‘forbidden’ each reaction is. To induce reactions on the ~0.1 s timescale of the experiments, the forbidden ring-opening reactions of benzocyclobutene, gem-difluorocyclopropane and gem-dichlorocyclopropane require approximately 130 pN less, 560 pN more and 1,000 pN more force, respectively, than their corresponding allowed analogues. The results provide the first experimental benchmarks for mechanically induced forbidden reactions, and in some cases suggest revisions to prior computational predictions. Externally applied mechanical forces can steer molecules along reaction paths that are otherwise inaccessible. Single-molecule force spectroscopy has now been used to quantify the force required to induce symmetry-forbidden reactivity in three different reactions and compare their behaviour to that of the symmetry-allowed analogues.

Unified biomimetic assembly of voacalgine A and bipleiophylline via divergent oxidative couplings

Bipleiophylline is a highly complex monoterpene indole alkaloid composed of two pleiocarpamine units anchored on an aromatic spacer platform. The synthesis of bipleiophylline is considered as a mountain to climb by the organic chemistry community. Here, a unified oxidative coupling protocol between indole derivatives and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, mediated by silver oxide, has been developed to produce the core of bipleiophylline. This method also allows the independent preparation of benzofuro[2,3-b]indolenine and isochromano[3,4-b]indolenine scaffolds, depending only on the nature of the aromatic platform used. The procedure has been applied to simple indole derivatives and to more challenging monoterpene indole alkaloids, thereby furnishing natural-product-like structures. The use of scarce pleiocarpamine as the starting indole allows the first syntheses of bipleiophylline and of its biosynthetic precursor, voacalgine A. The structure of the latter has been reassigned in the course of our investigations by 2D NMR and displays an isochromano[3,4-b]indolenine motif instead of a benzofuro[2,3-b]indolenine. The biomimetic syntheses of bipleiophylline, one of the most complex monoterpene indole alkaloids, and voacalgine A, its biosynthetic precursor, have been achieved from pleiocarpamine starting material. The development of a divergent oxidative coupling for the formation of the benzofuro[2,3-b]indolenine and isochromano[3,4-b]indolenine moieties was key to this accomplishment.

Rapid assembly of complex cyclopentanes employing chiral, α,β-unsaturated acylammonium intermediates

With the intention of improving synthetic efficiency, organic chemists have turned to bioinspired organocascade or domino processes that generate multiple bonds and stereocentres in a single operation. However, despite the great importance of substituted cyclopentanes, given their prevalence in complex natural products and pharmaceutical agents, the rapid, enantioselective assembly of these carbocycles lags behind cyclohexanes. Here, we describe a Michael–aldol-β-lactonization organocascade process for the synthesis of complex cyclopentanes utilizing chiral α,β-unsaturated acylammonium intermediates, readily generated by activation of commodity unsaturated acid chlorides with chiral isothiourea catalysts. This efficient methodology enables the construction of two C–C bonds, one C–O bond, two rings and up to three contiguous stereogenic centres delivering complex cyclopentanes with high levels of relative and absolute stereocontrol. Our results suggest that α,β-unsaturated acylammonium intermediates have broad utility for the design of organocascade and multicomponent processes, with the latter demonstrated by a Michael–Michael–aldol-β-lactonization. Despite their appearance in a number of bioactive natural products, the synthesis of 5-membered carbocycles has received much less attention than synthesis of their 6-membered counterparts. Here, a Michael-aldol-β-lactonization cascade is used to forge two C-C bonds, one C-O bond, two rings and up to three contiguous stereocentres and deliver complex cyclopentanes with high levels of relative and absolute stereocontrol.

Stereoretentive Pd-catalysed Stille cross-coupling reactions of secondary alkyl azastannatranes and aryl halides

The development of transition metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions has greatly influenced the manner in which the synthesis of complex organic molecules is approached. A wide variety of methods are now available for the formation of C(sp2)–C(sp2) bonds, and more recent work has focused on the use of C(sp3) electrophiles and nucleophiles. The use of secondary and tertiary alkyl nucleophiles in cross-coupling reactions remains a challenge because of the propensity of these alkyl groups to isomerize under the reaction conditions. Here, we report the development of a general Pd-catalysed process for the stereoretentive cross-coupling of secondary alkyl azastannatrane nucleophiles with aryl chlorides, bromides, iodides and triflates. Coupling partners with a wide range of electronic characteristics are well tolerated. The reaction occurs with minimal isomerization of the secondary alkyltin nucleophile, and with retention of absolute configuration. This process constitutes the first general method to use secondary alkyltin reagents in cross-coupling reactions. A general method for the stereoretentive Pd-catalysed cross-coupling of secondary alkyl azastannatranes and aryl electrophiles is described. This work constitutes the first example of a stereoretentive cross-coupling reaction using an unactivated, isolable, optically active organometallic nucleophile.

A two-dimensional mutate-and-map strategy for non-coding RNA structure

Non-coding RNAs fold into precise base-pairing patterns to carry out critical roles in genetic regulation and protein synthesis, but determining RNA structure remains difficult. Here, we show that coupling systematic mutagenesis with high-throughput chemical mapping enables accurate base-pair inference of domains from ribosomal RNA, ribozymes and riboswitches. For a six-RNA benchmark that has challenged previous chemical/computational methods, this ‘mutate-and-map’ strategy gives secondary structures that are in agreement with crystallography (helix error rates, 2%), including a blind test on a double-glycine riboswitch. Through modelling of partially ordered states, the method enables the first test of an interdomain helix-swap hypothesis for ligand-binding cooperativity in a glycine riboswitch. Finally, the data report on tertiary contacts within non-coding RNAs, and coupling to the Rosetta/FARFAR algorithm gives nucleotide-resolution three-dimensional models (helix root-mean-squared deviation, 5.7&nbsp;Å) of an adenine riboswitch. These results establish a promising two-dimensional chemical strategy for inferring the secondary and tertiary structures that underlie non-coding RNA behaviour. Non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous biomolecules with intricate three-dimensional folds that are difficult to characterize. This Article presents an information-rich strategy for inferring RNA structure by combining nucleotide-by-nucleotide mutagenesis with single-nucleotide-resolution chemical mapping.

Designing cooperatively folded abiotic uni- and multimolecular helix bundles

Abiotic foldamers, that is foldamers that have backbones chemically remote from peptidic and nucleotidic skeletons, may give access to shapes and functions different to those of peptides and nucleotides. However, design methodologies towards abiotic tertiary and quaternary structures are yet to be developed. Here we report rationally designed interactional patterns to guide the folding and assembly of abiotic helix bundles. Computational design facilitated the introduction of hydrogen-bonding functionalities at defined locations on the aromatic amide backbones that promote cooperative folding into helix–turn–helix motifs in organic solvents. The hydrogen-bond-directed aggregation of helices not linked by a turn unit produced several thermodynamically and kinetically stable homochiral dimeric and trimeric bundles with structures that are distinct from the designed helix–turn–helix. Relative helix orientation within the bundles may be changed from parallel to tilted on subtle solvent variations. Altogether, these results prefigure the richness and uniqueness of abiotic tertiary structure behaviour. Rationally designed arrays of hydrogen bonds between aromatic oligoamide segments have now been shown to generate abiotic helix-turn-helix and unexpected dimeric and trimeric helix bundle motifs. These structures show kinetic and thermodynamic stability, and cooperative folding in nonpolar solvents.

Bioorthogonal cyclization-mediated in situ self-assembly of small-molecule probes for imaging caspase activity in vivo

Directed self-assembly of small molecules in living systems could enable a myriad of applications in biology and medicine, and already this has been used widely to synthesize supramolecules and nano/microstructures in solution and in living cells. However, controlling the self-assembly of synthetic small molecules in living animals is challenging because of the complex and dynamic in vivo physiological environment. Here we employ an optimized first-order bioorthogonal cyclization reaction to control the self-assembly of a fluorescent small molecule, and demonstrate its in vivo applicability by imaging caspase-3/7 activity in human tumour xenograft mouse models of chemotherapy. The fluorescent nanoparticles assembled in situ were imaged successfully in both apoptotic cells and tumour tissues using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy. This strategy combines the advantages offered by small molecules with those of nanomaterials and should find widespread use for non-invasive imaging of enzyme activity in vivo. Controlling the self-assembly of small molecules within living animals is complicated because of the complex and dynamic nature of the physiological environment. Here, a strategy for directing in situ self-assembly of small molecules into fluorescent nano-aggregates in living mice is demonstrated. The nano-aggregates can be used for imaging caspase-3/7 activity in human tumour xenograft mouse models.

Darwinian evolution of an alternative genetic system provides support for TNA as an RNA progenitor

The pre-RNA world hypothesis postulates that RNA was preceded in the evolution of life by a simpler genetic material, but it is not known if such systems can fold into structures capable of eliciting a desired function. Presumably, whatever chemistry gave rise to RNA would have produced other RNA analogues, some of which may have preceded or competed directly with RNA. Threose nucleic acid (TNA), a potentially natural derivative of RNA, has received considerable interest as a possible RNA progenitor due to its chemical simplicity and ability to exchange genetic information with itself and RNA. Here, we have applied Darwinian evolution methods to evolve, in vitro, a TNA receptor that binds to an arbitrary target with high affinity and specificity. This demonstration shows that TNA has the ability to fold into tertiary structures with sophisticated chemical functions, which provides evidence that TNA could have served as an ancestral genetic system during an early stage of life. The pre-RNA-world hypothesis postulates that RNA was preceded in the evolution of life by a simpler genetic material. Here, Darwinian evolution methods were used to generate a threose nucleic acid (TNA) aptamer. This result provides evidence that TNA could have served as an ancestral genetic system during an early stage of life.

Imaging quantum stereodynamics through Fraunhofer scattering of NO radicals with rare-gas atoms

Stereodynamics describes how the vector properties of molecules, such as the directions in which they move and the axes about which they rotate, affect the probabilities (or cross-sections) of specific processes or transitions that occur on collision. The main aspects of stereodynamics in inelastic atom–molecule collisions can often be understood from classical considerations, in which the particles are represented by billiard-ball-like hard objects. In a quantum picture, however, the collision is described in terms of matter waves, which can also scatter into the region of the geometrical shadow of the object and reveal detailed information on the pure quantum-mechanical contribution to the stereodynamics. Here we present measurements of irregular diffraction patterns for NO radicals colliding with rare-gas atoms that can be explained by the analytical Fraunhofer model. They reveal a hitherto overlooked dependence on (or ‘propensity rule’ for) the magnetic quantum number m of the molecules, and a previously unrecognized type of quantum stereodynamics that has no classical analogue or interpretation. Stereodynamics describes how the vector properties of molecules affect the probabilities of specific processes in molecular collisions. Measurements of irregular diffraction patterns for NO radicals colliding with rare-gas atoms reveal a previously unrecognized type of quantum stereodynamics and a ‘propensity rule’ for the magnetic quantum number (m) of the molecules.

Pick-up, transport and release of a molecular cargo using a small-molecule robotic arm

Modern-day factory assembly lines often feature robots that pick up, reposition and connect components in a programmed manner. The idea of manipulating molecular fragments in a similar way has to date only been explored using biological building blocks (specifically DNA). Here, we report on a wholly artificial small-molecule robotic arm capable of selectively transporting a molecular cargo in either direction between two spatially distinct, chemically similar, sites on a molecular platform. The arm picks up/releases a 3-mercaptopropanehydrazide cargo by formation/breakage of a disulfide bond, while dynamic hydrazone chemistry controls the cargo binding to the platform. Transport is controlled by selectively inducing conformational and configurational changes within an embedded hydrazone rotary switch that steers the robotic arm. In a three-stage operation, 79–85% of 3-mercaptopropanehydrazide molecules are transported in either (chosen) direction between the two platform sites, without the cargo at any time fully dissociating from the machine nor exchanging with other molecules in the bulk. Factory assembly lines often feature robots that pick up, reposition and connect components in a programmed manner. Now, it has been shown that a molecular machine is able to pick up a cargo, reposition it, set it down and release it at a site approximately 2 nm away from the starting position.

Benzazetidine synthesis via palladium-catalysed intramolecular C−H amination

Small-sized N-heterocycles are important structures in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Palladium-catalysed intramolecular aminations of the C−H bonds of unfunctionalized amine precursors have recently emerged as an attractive new method for N-heterocycle synthesis. However, the way to control the reactivity of high-valent Pd intermediates to form the desired C−N cyclized products selectively remains poorly addressed. Herein we report a strategy to control the reductive elimination (RE) pathways in high-valent Pd catalysis and apply this strategy to achieve the synthesis of highly strained four-membered benzazetidines via the Pd-catalysed intramolecular C−H amination of N-benzyl picolinamides. These reactions represent the first practical synthetic method for benzazetidines and enable access to a range of complex benzazetidines from easily obtainable starting materials. The use of a newly designed phenyliodonium dimethylmalonate reagent is critical, as oxidation of Pd(II) palladacycles with this reagent favours a kinetically controlled C−N RE pathway to give strained ring-closed products. Hampered by a lack of practical syntheses, benzazetidines are one of the few rarely explored compounds in N-heterocyclic chemical space. An efficient synthesis of various benzazetidines by Pd-catalysed intramolecular C−H amination of N-benzyl picolinamides is now reported. Reagent-controlled reductive elimination of a Pd intermediate is a key aspect of this particular method.

Atom-efficient regioselective 1,2-dearomatization of functionalized pyridines by an earth-abundant organolanthanide catalyst

Developing earth-abundant, non-platinum metal catalysts for high-value chemical transformations is a critical challenge to contemporary chemical synthesis. Dearomatization of pyridine derivatives is an important transformation to access a wide range of valuable nitrogenous natural products, pharmaceuticals and materials. Here, we report an efficient 1,2-regioselective organolanthanide-catalysed pyridine dearomatization process using pinacolborane, which is compatible with a broad range of pyridines and functional groups and employs equimolar reagent stoichiometry. Regarding the mechanism, derivation of the rate law from NMR spectroscopic and kinetic measurements suggests first order in catalyst concentration, fractional order in pyridine concentration and inverse first order in pinacolborane concentration, with C=N insertion into the La–H bond as turnover-determining. An energetic span analysis affords a more detailed understanding of experimental activity trends and the unusual kinetic behaviour, and proposes the catalyst ‘resting’ state and potential deactivation pathways. Selective pyridine dearomatization processes traditionally use precious metal catalysts with reagents in stoichiometric excess, and are not well-understood mechanistically. Now, efficient 1,2-regioselective pyridine dearomatization is achieved using equimolar pinacolborane and an earth-abundant lanthanide catalyst. Mechanistic and theoretical studies elucidate the reaction mechanism and explain observed reactivity trends.

Rapid point-of-care detection of the tuberculosis pathogen using a BlaC-specific fluorogenic probe

Early diagnosis of tuberculosis can dramatically reduce both its transmission and the associated death rate. The extremely slow growth rate of the causative pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), however, makes this challenging at the point of care, particularly in resource-limited settings. Here we report the use of BlaC (an enzyme naturally expressed/secreted by tubercle bacilli) as a marker and the design of BlaC-specific fluorogenic substrates as probes for Mtb detection. These probes showed an enhancement by 100–200 times in fluorescence emission on BlaC activation and a greater than 1,000-fold selectivity for BlaC over TEM-1 β-lactamase, an important factor in reducing false-positive diagnoses. Insight into the BlaC specificity was revealed by successful co-crystallization of the probe/enzyme mutant complex. A refined green fluorescent probe (CDG-OMe) enabled the successful detection of live pathogen in less than ten minutes, even in unprocessed human sputum. This system offers the opportunity for the rapid, accurate detection of very low numbers of Mtb for the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis in sputum and other specimens. Rapid diagnostic methods that can be applied in resource-limited settings are important in the fight against tuberculosis. Here, fluorogenic probes are described that are activated by BlaC — an enzyme secreted by tubercle bacilli. The probes have enabled detection in unprocessed human sputum of live pathogen in less than 10&nbsp;min.

Component-based syntheses of trioxacarcin A, DC-45-A1 and structural analogues

The trioxacarcins are polyoxygenated, structurally complex natural products that potently inhibit the growth of cultured human cancer cells. Here we describe syntheses of trioxacarcin A, DC-45-A1 and structural analogues by late-stage stereoselective glycosylation reactions of fully functionalized, differentially protected aglycon substrates. Key issues addressed in this work include the identification of an appropriate means to activate and protect each of the two 2-deoxysugar components, trioxacarcinose A and trioxacarcinose B, as well as a viable sequencing of the glycosidic couplings. The convergent, component-based sequence we present allows for rapid construction of structurally diverse, synthetic analogues that would be inaccessible by any other means, in amounts required to support biological evaluation. Analogues that arise from the modification of four of five modular components are assembled in 11 steps or fewer. The majority of these are found to be active in antiproliferative assays using cultured human cancer cells.

An autonomous molecular assembler for programmable chemical synthesis

Molecular machines that assemble polymers in a programmed sequence are fundamental to life. They are also an achievable goal of nanotechnology. Here, we report synthetic molecular machinery made from DNA that controls and records the formation of covalent bonds. We show that an autonomous cascade of DNA hybridization reactions can create oligomers, from building blocks linked by olefin or peptide bonds, with a sequence defined by a reconfigurable molecular program. The system can also be programmed to achieve combinatorial assembly. The sequence of assembly reactions and thus the structure of each oligomer synthesized is recorded in a DNA molecule, which enables this information to be recovered by PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing. Molecular machines that assemble polymers in a programmed sequence are fundamental to life. Now, synthetic machinery built from DNA has been used to execute a molecular program that produces peptides, or olefin oligomers, with a defined sequence. The oligomeric product is linked to a double-stranded DNA product that records the sequence of reactions that were executed.

Total synthesis of (–)-tubingensin B enabled by the strategic use of an aryne cyclization

Tubingensin B is an indole diterpenoid that bears a daunting chemical structure featuring a disubstituted carbazole unit, five stereogenic centres—three of which are quaternary—and a decorated [3.2.2]-bridged bicycle. We describe our synthetic design toward a concise and enantiospecific total synthesis of tubingensin B, which hinges on the strategic use of a transient aryne intermediate. Although initial studies led to unexpected reaction outcomes, we ultimately implemented a sequence of carbazolyne cyclization followed by Rh-catalysed fragmentation to install the seven-membered ring and vicinal quaternary stereocentres of the natural product. Coupled with a late-stage radical cyclization to construct the [3.2.2]-bridged bicycle, these efforts have enabled the total synthesis of tubingensin B. The design and evolution of our succinct total synthesis underscores the utility of long-avoided aryne intermediates for the introduction of structural motifs that have conventionally been viewed as challenging. The total synthesis of tubingensin B — an indole diterpenoid that bears a daunting chemical structure — has now been achieved.

In situ observation of self-assembled hydrocarbon Fischer–Tropsch products on a cobalt catalyst

Fischer–Tropsch synthesis is a heterogeneous catalytic reaction that creates approximately 2% of the world's fuel. It involves the synthesis of linear hydrocarbon molecules from a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at high pressures (from a few to tens of bars) and high temperatures (200–350 °C). To gain further insight into the fundamental mechanisms of this industrial process, we have used a purpose-built scanning tunnelling microscope to monitor a cobalt model catalyst under reaction conditions. We show that, after 30 minutes of reaction, the terraces of the cobalt catalyst are covered by parallel arrays of stripes. We propose that the stripes are formed by the self-assembly of linear hydrocarbon product molecules. Surprisingly, the width of the stripes corresponds to molecules that are 14 or 15 carbon atoms long. We introduce a simple model that explains the accumulation of such long molecules by describing their monomer-by-monomer synthesis and explicitly accounting for their thermal desorption. During the Fischer-Tropsch catalytic reaction, alkanes are synthesized from carbon monoxide and hydrogen at high pressure and temperature. Now it is shown using scanning tunnelling imaging of a cobalt surface during reaction that linear alkane product molecules of a specific length self-assemble on terraces, facilitating the desorption of new product molecules created at step sites.

Engineering nanometre-scale coherence in soft matter

Electronic delocalization in redox-active polymers may be disrupted by the heterogeneity of the environment that surrounds each monomer. When the differences in monomer redox-potential induced by the environment are small (as compared with the monomer–monomer electronic interactions), delocalization persists. Here we show that guanine (G) runs in double-stranded DNA support delocalization over 4–5 guanine bases. The weak interaction between delocalized G blocks on opposite DNA strands is known to support partially coherent long-range charge transport. The molecular-resolution model developed here finds that the coherence among these G blocks follows an even–odd orbital-symmetry rule and predicts that weakening the interaction between G blocks exaggerates the resistance oscillations. These findings indicate how sequence can be exploited to change the balance between coherent and incoherent transport. The predictions are tested and confirmed using break-junction experiments. Thus, tailored orbital symmetry and structural fluctuations may be used to produce coherent transport with a length scale of multiple nanometres in soft-matter assemblies, a length scale comparable to that of small proteins. The existence (or not) of electronic coherence in homopolymers is dependent on a balance between monomer–monomer interactions and environmental heterogeneity. Now, by understanding how even–odd orbital symmetry influences coherence and produces resistance oscillations as a function of distance—it is shown that DNA sequences can be designed to support coherent charge transport.

Photoinduced reversible switching of porosity in molecular crystals based on star-shaped azobenzene tetramers

The development of solid materials that can be reversibly interconverted by light between forms with different physico-chemical properties is of great interest for separation, catalysis, optoelectronics, holography, mechanical actuation and solar energy conversion. Here, we describe a series of shape-persistent azobenzene tetramers that form porous molecular crystals in their E-configuration, the porosity of which can be tuned by changing the peripheral substituents on the molecule. Efficient E→Z photoisomerization of the azobenzene units takes place in the solid state and converts the crystals into a non-porous amorphous melt phase. Crystallinity and porosity are restored upon Z→E isomerization promoted by visible light irradiation or heating. We demonstrate that the photoisomerization enables reversible on/off switching of optical properties such as birefringence as well as the capture of CO2 from the gas phase. The linear design, structural versatility and synthetic accessibility make this new family of materials potentially interesting for technological applications. Rigid star-shaped azobenzene tetramers form a porous molecular crystal when the azobenzene moieties are in the trans configuration, and a non-porous amorphous material on their isomerization to the cis configuration. These two forms are reversibly interconverted in the solid state by light irradiation, thus enabling the photoswitching of optical and gas-capture properties.

Uranium and manganese assembled in a wheel-shaped nanoscale single-molecule magnet with high spin-reversal barrier

Discrete molecular compounds that exhibit both magnetization hysteresis and slow magnetic relaxation below a characteristic ‘blocking’ temperature are known as single-molecule magnets. These are promising for applications including memory devices and quantum computing, but require higher spin-inversion barriers and hysteresis temperatures than currently achieved. After twenty years of research confined to the d- block transition metals, scientists are moving to the f-block to generate these properties. We have now prepared, by cation-promoted self-assembly, a large 5f–3d U12Mn6 cluster that adopts a wheel topology and exhibits single-molecule magnet behaviour. This uranium-based molecular wheel shows an open magnetic hysteresis loop at low temperature, with a non-zero coercive field (below 4&nbsp;K) and quantum tunnelling steps (below 2.5&nbsp;K), which suggests that uranium might indeed provide a route to magnetic storage devices. This molecule also represents an interesting model for actinide nanoparticles occurring in the environment and in spent fuel separation cycles. A {U12Mn6} wheel-shaped cluster that has been assembled through cation–cation interactions exhibits single-molecule-magnet behaviour. Single-molecule magnets are promising for magnetic storage devices at the nanoscale, and the observation of magnetic bistability with an open hysteresis loop and high relaxation barrier in this 5f–3d complex suggests that uranium-based compounds could be useful components.

Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy reveals the complex behaviour of an amyloid fibril inhibitor

Amyloid formation has been implicated in the pathology of over 20 human diseases, but the rational design of amyloid inhibitors is hampered by a lack of structural information about amyloid–inhibitor complexes. We use isotope labelling and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to obtain a residue-specific structure for the complex of human amylin (the peptide responsible for islet amyloid formation in type 2 diabetes) with a known inhibitor (rat amylin). Based on its sequence, rat amylin should block formation of the C-terminal β-sheet, but at 8&nbsp;h after mixing, rat amylin blocks the N-terminal β-sheet instead. At 24&nbsp;h after mixing, rat amylin blocks neither β-sheet and forms its own β-sheet, most probably on the outside of the human fibrils. This is striking, because rat amylin is natively disordered and not previously known to form amyloid β-sheets. The results show that even seemingly intuitive inhibitors may function by unforeseen and complex structural processes. Molecular inhibitors of amyloid formation could help combat Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and other major human diseases. Here, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and residue-specific isotope labelling are used to obtain detailed structural information on amyloid-inhibitor complexes. The unexpected behaviour observed helps to explain the moderate activity of the inhibitor studied.

Aldehydes as alkyl carbanion equivalents for additions to carbonyl compounds

Nucleophilic addition reactions of organometallic reagents to carbonyl compounds for carbon–carbon bond construction have played a pivotal role in modern chemistry. However, this reaction's reliance on petroleum-derived chemical feedstocks and a stoichiometric quantity of metal have prompted the development of many carbanion equivalents and catalytic metal alternatives. Here, we show that naturally occurring carbonyls can be used as latent alkyl carbanion equivalents for additions to carbonyl compounds, via reductive polarity reversal. Such ‘umpolung’ reactivity is facilitated by a ruthenium catalyst and diphosphine ligand under mild conditions, delivering synthetically valuable secondary and tertiary alcohols in up to 98% yield. The unique chemoselectivity exhibited by carbonyl-derived carbanion equivalents is demonstrated by their tolerance to protic reaction media and good functional group compatibility. Enantioenriched tertiary alcohols can also be accessed with the aid of chiral ligands, albeit with moderate stereocontrol. Such carbonyl-derived carbanion equivalents are anticipated to find broad utility in chemical bond formation. Methods utilizing renewable feedstocks are critical to accessing molecules of industrial importance in light of the present ecological and economic climate. Here, it is shown that umpolung reactivity of carbonyl compounds can be used for nucleophilic additions to yield a diverse array of valuable alcohols as an alternative to using stoichiometric organometallic reagents.

Triazolinediones enable ultrafast and reversible click chemistry for the design of dynamic polymer systems

With its focus on synthetic reactions that are highly specific and reliable, ‘click’ chemistry has become a valuable tool for many scientific research areas and applications. Combining the modular, covalently bonded nature of click-chemistry linkages with an ability to reverse these linkages and reuse the constituent reactants in another click reaction, however, is a feature that is not found in most click reactions. Here we show that triazolinedione compounds can be used in click-chemistry applications. We present examples of simple and ultrafast macromolecular functionalization, polymer–polymer linking and polymer crosslinking under ambient conditions without the need for a catalyst. Moreover, when triazolinediones are combined with indole reaction partners, the reverse reaction can also be induced at elevated temperatures, and the triazolinedione reacted with a different reaction partner, reversibly or irreversibly dependent on its exact nature. We have used this ‘transclick’ reaction to introduce thermoreversible links into polyurethane and polymethacrylate materials, which allows dynamic polymer-network healing, reshaping and recycling. Macromolecular functionalization and linking are often facilitated by using ‘click’ chemistries. Now, triazolinediones have been used in ultrafast click reactions under additive-free, ambient conditions for polymer conjugation. Clicking to indoles gives an adduct that is dynamic at elevated temperatures, which produces properties such as polymer-network healing, reshaping and recycling.

Transition-metal-free chemo- and regioselective vinylation of azaallyls

Direct C(sp3)–C(sp2) bond formation under transition-metal-free conditions offers an atom-economical, inexpensive and environmentally benign alternative to traditional transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. A new chemo- and regioselective coupling protocol between 3-aryl-substituted-1,1-diphenyl-2-azaallyl derivatives and vinyl bromides has been developed. This is the first transition-metal-free cross-coupling of azaallyls with vinyl bromide electrophiles and delivers allylic amines in excellent yields (up to 99%). This relatively simple and mild protocol offers a direct and practical strategy for the synthesis of high-value allylic amine building blocks that does not require the use of transition metals, special initiators or photoredox catalysts. Radical clock experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance studies and density functional theory calculations point to an unprecedented substrate-dependent coupling mechanism. Furthermore, an electron paramagnetic resonance signal was observed when the N-benzyl benzophenone ketimine was subjected to silylamide base, supporting the formation of radical species upon deprotonation. The unique mechanisms outlined herein could pave the way for new approaches to transition-metal-free C–C bond formations. Cross coupling under transition-metal-free conditions is an attractive and economic alternative to traditional transition-metal-catalysed methods. Metal-free coupling of azaallyls has now been demonstrated with vinyl bromide electrophiles, delivering allylic amines in excellent yields. Moreover, mechanistic evidence supports dual reaction pathways triggered by azaallyl anions and radicals.

Title: 
Designed metalloprotein stabilizes a semiquinone radical

Enzymes use binding energy to stabilize their substrates in high-energy states that are otherwise inaccessible at ambient temperature. Here we show that a de novo designed Zn(II) metalloprotein stabilizes a chemically reactive organic radical that is otherwise unstable in aqueous media. The protein binds tightly to and stabilizes the radical semiquinone form of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol. Solution NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations show that the substrate binds in the active site pocket where it is stabilized by metal–ligand interactions as well as by burial of its hydrophobic groups. Spectrochemical redox titrations show that the protein stabilized the semiquinone by reducing the electrochemical midpoint potential for its formation via the one-electron oxidation of the catechol by approximately 400 mV (9 kcal mol−1). Therefore, the inherent chemical properties of the radical were changed drastically by harnessing its binding energy to the metalloprotein. This model sets the basis for designed enzymes with radical cofactors to tackle challenging chemistry. Nature's speciality is to direct and control the reactivity of species, which are otherwise fatally destructive. However, the processes and design rules required to achieve such precise control are not clear. A de novo designed metalloprotein that stabilizes an otherwise unstable organic radical has now been developed to guide our understanding.

Key stabilizing elements of protein structure identified through pressure and temperature perturbation of its hydrogen bond network

Hydrogen bonds are key constituents of biomolecular structures, and their response to external perturbations may reveal important insights about the most stable components of a structure. NMR spectroscopy can probe hydrogen bond deformations at very high resolution through hydrogen bond scalar couplings (HBCs). However, the small size of HBCs has so far prevented a comprehensive quantitative characterization of protein hydrogen bonds as a function of the basic thermodynamic parameters of pressure and temperature. Using a newly developed pressure cell, we have now mapped pressure- and temperature-dependent changes of 31 hydrogen bonds in ubiquitin by measuring HBCs with very high precision. Short-range hydrogen bonds are only moderately perturbed, but many hydrogen bonds with large sequence separations (high contact order) show greater changes. In contrast, other high-contact-order hydrogen bonds remain virtually unaffected. The specific stabilization of such topologically important connections may present a general principle with which to achieve protein stability and to preserve structural integrity during protein function. The pressure- and temperature-dependent changes of various hydrogen bonds within ubiquitin have been determined at very high resolution using NMR H-bond scalar couplings. The measured perturbations show a correlation with the sequence separation between donor and acceptor residues, and indicate that certain topologically crucial H-bonds are specifically stabilized.

Title: 
Molecular shape sorting using molecular organic cages

The energy-efficient separation of chemical feedstocks is a major sustainability challenge. Porous extended frameworks such as zeolites or metal–organic frameworks are one potential solution to this problem. Here, we show that organic molecules, rather than frameworks, can separate other organic molecules by size and shape. A molecular organic cage is shown to separate a common aromatic feedstock (mesitylene) from its structural isomer (4-ethyltoluene) with an unprecedented perfect specificity for the latter. This specificity stems from the structure of the intrinsically porous cage molecule, which is itself synthesized from a derivative of mesitylene. In other words, crystalline organic molecules are used to separate other organic molecules. The specificity is defined by the cage structure alone, so this solid-state ‘shape sorting’ is, uniquely, mirrored for cage molecules in solution. The behaviour can be understood from a combination of atomistic simulations for individual cage molecules and solid-state molecular dynamics simulations. A crystalline porous organic cage molecule is shown to have exceptional specificity for separating different structural isomers of C9 aromatics. Uniquely, this solid-state specificity is preconfigured in the discrete molecular building block, which shows an analogous specificity in solution. Both solution and solid-state behaviours can be understood by molecular dynamics simulations.

Stepwise growth of surface-grafted DNA nanotubes visualized at the single-molecule level

DNA nanotubes offer a high aspect ratio and rigidity, attractive attributes for the controlled assembly of hierarchically complex linear arrays. It is highly desirable to control the positioning of rungs along the backbone of the nanotubes, minimize the polydispersity in their manufacture and reduce the building costs. We report here a solid-phase synthesis methodology in which, through a cyclic scheme starting from a ‘foundation rung’ specifically bound to the surface, distinct rungs can be incorporated in a predetermined manner. Each rung is orthogonally addressable. Using fluorescently tagged rungs, single-molecule fluorescence studies demonstrated the robustness and structural fidelity of the constructs and confirmed the incorporation of the rungs in quantitative yield (&gt;95%) at each step of the cycle. Prototype structures that consisted of up to 20 repeat units, about 450 nm in contour length, were constructed. Combined, the solid-phase synthesis strategy described and its visualization through single-molecule spectroscopy show good promise for the production of custom-made DNA nanotubes. DNA nanotubes are attractive building blocks for the assembly of complex arrays. An efficient solid-state synthesis for producing surface-grafted, robust nanotubes has now been devised. Rungs are incorporated in a stepwise manner so that each one is addressable. Using fluorescent tags, the nanotube growth was visualized at the single-molecule level.

Title: 
Quasicrystallinity expressed in two-dimensional coordination networks

The recognition of quasicrystals, which exhibit long-range order but lack translational symmetry, represented both the introduction of a new class of materials and a transformative breakthrough in crystallography. Concomitant with the exploration of quasicrystallinity, metal–organic architectures emerged as promising and versatile systems with significant application potential. Their building principles have been studied extensively and become manifest in a multitude of intricate amorphous and crystalline phases. To date, however, indications for quasicrystalline order have been elusive in metal–organic coordination networks (MOCNs). Here we employ rare-earth-directed assembly to construct a two-dimensional tiling with quasicrystalline characteristics at a well-defined gold substrate. By careful stoichiometry control over europium centres and functional linkers, we produced a porous network, including the simultaneous expression of four-fold, five-fold and six-fold vertices. The pertaining features were directly inspected by scanning tunnelling microscopy, and the molecule–europium reticulation was recognized as square-triangle tessellation with dodecagonal symmetry. Our findings introduce quasicrystallinity in surface-confined MOCNs with a nanoporous structure and anticipate functionalities that arise from quasicrystalline ordering of the coordinative spheres. Quasicrystalline materials exhibit long-range order but no translational periodicity. Now, a random tiling quasicrystal has been fabricated on a Au(111) surface by coordination interactions between europium centres and linear dicarbonitrile linkers under stoichiometry control. The 2D metal–organic network exhibits the simultaneous presence of four-, five- and six-fold vertices and dodecagonal symmetry.

Title: 
A homogeneous transition metal complex for clean hydrogen production from methanol–water mixtures

The development of an efficient catalytic process that mimics the enzymatic function of alcohol dehydrogenase is critical for using biomass alcohols for both the production of H2 as a chemical energy carrier and fine chemicals under waste-free conditions. Dehydrogenation of alcohol–water mixtures into their corresponding acids with molecular hydrogen as the sole by-product from the reaction can be catalysed by a ruthenium complex with a chelating bis(olefin) diazadiene ligand. This complex, [K(dme)2][Ru(H)(trop2dad)], stores up to two equivalents of hydrogen intramolecularly, and catalyses the production of H2 from alcohols in the presence of water and a base under homogeneous conditions. The conversion of a MeOH–H2O mixture proceeds selectively to CO2/H2 gas formation under neutral conditions, thereby allowing the use of the entire hydrogen content (12% by weight). Isolation and characterization of the ruthenium complexes from these reactions suggested a mechanistic scenario in which the trop2dad ligand behaves as a chemically ‘non-innocent’ co-operative ligand. A ruthenium complex bearing a chemically and redox-non-innocent tetradentate diolefin diazadiene ligand is shown to be an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the conversion of a 1:1 mixture of methanol and water to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Development of this process is an important step in the production of hydrogen for use as a fuel from biomass.

Total synthesis of the Daphniphyllum alkaloid daphenylline

The Daphniphyllum alkaloids are a large class of natural products isolated from a genus of evergreen plants widely used in Chinese herbal medicine. They display a remarkable range of biological activities, including anticancer, antioxidant, and vasorelaxation properties as well as elevation of nerve growth factor. Daphenylline is a structurally unique member among the predominately aliphatic Daphniphyllum alkaloids, and contains a tetrasubstituted arene moiety mounted on a sterically compact hexacyclic scaffold. Herein, we describe the first total synthesis of daphenylline. A gold-catalysed 6-exo-dig cyclization reaction and a subsequent intramolecular Michael addition reaction, inspired by Dixon's seminal work, were exploited to construct the bridged 6,6,5-tricyclic motif of the natural product at an early stage, and the aromatic moiety was forged through a photoinduced olefin isomerization/6π-electrocyclization cascade followed by an oxidative aromatization process. Daphenylline is an alkaloid containing a tetra-substituted arene within a sterically compact hexacyclic scaffold. Here, the first total synthesis of daphenylline is described. A gold-catalysed 6-exo-dig cyclization reaction was exploited to construct the bridged 6,6-bicycle at an early stage, the aromatic moiety was forged through a photoinduced olefin isomerization/6π electrocyclization cascade followed by oxidative aromatization.

Hollow nanotubular toroidal polymer microrings

Despite the remarkable progress made in the self-assembly of nano- and microscale architectures with well-defined sizes and shapes, a self-organization-based synthesis of hollow toroids has, so far, proved to be elusive. Here, we report the synthesis of polymer microrings made from rectangular, flat and rigid-core monomers with anisotropically predisposed alkene groups, which are crosslinked with each other by dithiol linkers using thiol-ene photopolymerization. The resulting hollow toroidal structures are shape-persistent and mechanically robust in solution. In addition, their size can be tuned by controlling the initial monomer concentrations, an observation that is supported by a theoretical analysis. These hollow microrings can encapsulate guest molecules in the intratoroidal nanospace, and their peripheries can act as templates for circular arrays of metal nanoparticles. Mechanically robust and shape-persistent hollow toroidal polymer microrings have been synthesized directly by thiol-ene photopolymerization of rectangular-shaped monomers with dithiols. The size of the microrings can be tuned by varying the monomer concentration. The resulting structures can encapsulate molecules in their hollow interiors and also serve as scaffolds to template the formation of circular arrays of metal nanoparticles.

Copper-catalysed selective hydroamination reactions of alkynes

The development of selective reactions that utilize easily available and abundant precursors for the efficient synthesis of amines is a long-standing goal of chemical research. Despite the centrality of amines in a number of important research areas, including medicinal chemistry, total synthesis and materials science, a general, selective and step-efficient synthesis of amines is still needed. Here, we describe a set of mild catalytic conditions utilizing a single copper-based catalyst that enables the direct preparation of three distinct and important amine classes (enamines, α-chiral branched alkylamines and linear alkylamines) from readily available alkyne starting materials with high levels of chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity. This methodology was applied to the asymmetric synthesis of rivastigmine and the formal synthesis of several other pharmaceutical agents, including duloxetine, atomoxetine, fluoxetine and tolterodine. Amines are essential in a number of research areas, but a general, selective and step-efficient synthesis has been elusive. Now, the use of a single copper catalyst to transform alkynes into enamines, α-chiral branched alkylamines, and linear alkylamines is described. These transformations have been applied in the preparation of a selection of current pharmaceutical agents.

Protein camouflage in cytochrome c–calixarene complexes

Small molecules that recognize protein surfaces are important tools for modifying protein interaction properties. Since the 1980s, several thousand studies concerning calixarenes and host–guest interactions have been published. Although there is growing interest in protein–calixarene interactions, only limited structural information has been available to date. We now report the crystal structure of a protein–calixarene complex. The water-soluble p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene is shown to bind the lysine-rich cytochrome c at three different sites. Binding curves obtained from NMR titrations reveal an interaction process that involves two or more binding sites. Together, the data indicate a dynamic complex in which the calixarene explores the surface of cytochrome c. In addition to providing valuable information on protein recognition, the data also indicate that the calixarene is a mediator of protein–protein interactions, with potential applications in generating assemblies and promoting crystallization. A calixarene–protein host–guest complex has been characterized in detail by using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The water-soluble sulfonato-calix[4]arene binds to cytochrome c at various lysine residues to yield a dynamic complex. This interaction may serve to facilitate crystallization by mediating protein–protein contacts.

Title: 
Cooperative singlet and triplet exciton transport in tetracene crystals visualized by ultrafast microscopy

Singlet fission presents an attractive solution to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit by generating two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton. However, although triplet excitons are long-lived, their transport occurs through a Dexter transfer, making them slower than singlet excitons, which travel by means of a Förster mechanism. A thorough understanding of the interplay between singlet fission and exciton transport is therefore necessary to assess the potential and challenges of singlet-fission utilization. Here, we report a direct visualization of exciton transport in single tetracene crystals using transient absorption microscopy with 200 fs time resolution and 50 nm spatial precision. These measurements reveal a new singlet-mediated transport mechanism for triplets, which leads to an enhancement in effective triplet exciton diffusion of more than one order of magnitude on picosecond to nanosecond timescales. These results establish that there are optimal energetics of singlet and triplet excitons that benefit both singlet fission and exciton diffusion. Understanding the interplay between singlet fission and exciton transport is important if singlet-fission materials are to be used for solar cell applications. Now, a cooperative singlet–triplet transport mechanism has been revealed through ultrafast transient absorption microscopy.

Title: 
Charging a Li–O2 battery using a redox mediator

The non-aqueous Li–air (O2) battery is receiving intense interest because its theoretical specific energy exceeds that of Li-ion batteries. Recharging the Li–O2 battery depends on oxidizing solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2), which is formed on discharge within the porous cathode. However, transporting charge between Li2O2 particles and the solid electrode surface is at best very difficult and leads to voltage polarization on charging, even at modest rates. This is a significant problem facing the non-aqueous Li–O2 battery. Here we show that incorporation of a redox mediator, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), enables recharging at rates that are impossible for the cell in the absence of the mediator. On charging, TTF is oxidized to TTF+ at the cathode surface; TTF+ in turn oxidizes the solid Li2O2, which results in the regeneration of TTF. The mediator acts as an electron–hole transfer agent that permits efficient oxidation of solid Li2O2. The cell with the mediator demonstrated 100 charge/discharge cycles. Recharging Li–O2 batteries requires oxidation of the discharge product solid Li2O2. Now a redox-mediating molecule is shown to assist this process by transferring electron–holes between solid Li2O2 and the positive electrode in a non-aqueous Li–O2 cell. This allows the cell to be charged at rates that are otherwise impossible.

Freeze–thaw cycles as drivers of complex ribozyme assembly

The emergence of an RNA catalyst capable of self-replication is considered a key transition in the origin of life. However, how such replicase ribozymes emerged from the pools of short RNA oligomers arising from prebiotic chemistry and non-enzymatic replication is unclear. Here we show that RNA polymerase ribozymes can assemble from simple catalytic networks of RNA oligomers no longer than 30 nucleotides. The entropically disfavoured assembly reaction is driven by iterative freeze–thaw cycles, even in the absence of external activation chemistry. The steep temperature and concentration gradients of such cycles result in an RNA chaperone effect that enhances the otherwise only partially realized catalytic potential of the RNA oligomer pool by an order of magnitude. Our work outlines how cyclic physicochemical processes could have driven an expansion of RNA compositional and phenotypic complexity from simple oligomer pools. During the early stages of life on Earth sophisticated RNA catalysts must have formed from simple precursors. Here it is shown that freeze–thaw cycles can drive the assembly of complex RNA polymerase ribozymes from networks of short RNA oligonucleotides through an unanticipated RNA chaperone effect.

Title: 
Discovery and introduction of a (3,18)-connected net as an ideal blueprint for the design of metal–organic frameworks

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of porous materials because it is possible to mutually control their porous structure, composition and functionality. However, it is still a challenge to predict the network topology of such framework materials prior to their synthesis. Here we use a new rare earth (RE) nonanuclear carboxylate-based cluster as an 18-connected molecular building block to form a gea-MOF (gea-MOF-1) based on a (3,18)-connected net. We then utilized this gea net as a blueprint to design and assemble another MOF (gea-MOF-2). In gea-MOF-2, the 18-connected RE clusters are replaced by metal–organic polyhedra, peripherally functionalized so as to have the same connectivity as the RE clusters. These metal–organic polyhedra act as supermolecular building blocks when they form gea-MOF-2. The discovery of a (3,18)-connected MOF followed by deliberate transposition of its topology to a predesigned second MOF with a different chemical system validates the prospective rational design of MOFs. It is often difficult to predict or control the topologies of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) before synthesis. Now, the topology of a MOF has been used as an ideal blueprint for the deliberate design of a related MOF, by substitution of molecular building blocks with supermolecular building blocks. The two MOFs share the same underlying topology but have different chemical compositions.

Supramolecular heterostructures formed by sequential epitaxial deposition of two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded arrays

Two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular arrays provide a route to the spatial control of the chemical functionality of a surface, but their deposition is in almost all cases limited to a monolayer termination. Here we investigated the sequential deposition of one 2D array on another to form a supramolecular heterostructure and realize the growth—normal to the underlying substrate—of distinct ordered layers, each of which is stabilized by in-plane hydrogen bonding. For heterostructures formed by depositing terephthalic acid or trimesic acid on cyanuric acid/melamine, we have determined, using atomic force microscopy under ambient conditions, a clear epitaxial arrangement despite the intrinsically distinct symmetries and/or lattice constants of each layer. Structures calculated using classical molecular dynamics are in excellent agreement with the orientation, registry and dimensions of the epitaxial layers. Calculations confirm that van der Waals interactions provide the dominant contribution to the adsorption energy and registry of the layers. Supramolecular heterostructures have been formed by the sequential deposition of two molecular layers with different symmetries and lattice constants — one consisting of carboxylic acid, the other of cyanuric acid and melamine — on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate. Characterization by atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations shows epitaxial arrangements between the layers.

A two-dimensional conjugated aromatic polymer via C–C coupling reaction

The fabrication of crystalline 2D conjugated polymers with well-defined repeating units and in-built porosity presents a significant challenge to synthetic chemists. Yet they present an appealing target because of their desirable physical and electronic properties. Here we report the preparation of a 2D conjugated aromatic polymer synthesized via C–C coupling reactions between tetrabromopolyaromatic monomers. Pre-arranged monomers in the bulk crystal undergo C–C coupling driven by endogenous solid-state polymerization to produce a crystalline polymer, which can be mechanically exfoliated into micrometre-sized lamellar sheets with a thickness of 1 nm. Isothermal gas-sorption measurements of the bulk material reveal a dominant pore size of ~0.6 nm, which indicates uniform open channels from the eclipsed stacking of the sheets. When employed as an organic anode in an ambient-temperature sodium cell, the material allows a fast charge/discharge of sodium ions, with impressive reversible capacity, rate capability and stability metrics. The synthesis of well-defined planar polymers presents a significant challenge for chemists seeking to investigate their potential for use in emerging technologies. Now, a two-dimensional conjugated aromatic polymer has been synthesized via endogenous solid-state polymerization of pre-arranged monomers, and its performance as an organic anode in an ambient temperature sodium cell tested.

Stability of quantum dots in live cells

Quantum dots are highly fluorescent and photostable, making them excellent tools for imaging. When using these quantum dots in cells and animals, however, intracellular biothiols (such as glutathione and cysteine) can degrade the quantum dot monolayer, compromising function. Here, we describe a label-free method to quantify the intracellular stability of monolayers on quantum dot surfaces that couples laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Using this new approach we have demonstrated that quantum dot monolayer stability is correlated with both quantum dot particle size and monolayer structure, with appropriate choice of both particle size and ligand structure required for intracellular stability. Intracellular biothiols can degrade nanoparticle monolayers, compromising the function of these potentially promising tools. Here, we describe a label-free method for quantifying the intracellular stability of quantum dot monolayers, using laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.

Title: 
How much do van der Waals dispersion forces contribute to molecular recognition in solution?

The emergent properties that arise from self-assembly and molecular recognition phenomena are a direct consequence of non-covalent interactions. Gas-phase measurements and computational methods point to the dominance of dispersion forces in molecular association, but solvent effects complicate the unambiguous quantification of these forces in solution. Here, we have used synthetic molecular balances to measure interactions between apolar alkyl chains in 31 organic, fluorous and aqueous solvent environments. The experimental interaction energies are an order of magnitude smaller than estimates of dispersion forces between alkyl chains that have been derived from vaporization enthalpies and dispersion-corrected calculations. Instead, it was found that cohesive solvent–solvent interactions are the major driving force behind apolar association in solution. The results suggest that theoretical models that implicate important roles for dispersion forces in molecular recognition events should be interpreted with caution in solvent-accessible systems. Attractive van der Waals dispersion forces have been implicated in mechanisms as diverse as gecko adhesion and anaesthesia. Now, it has been found using synthetic molecular balances that dispersion forces between alkyl chains are an order of magnitude weaker in solution than they are in the gas phase.

Phosphorylation-mediated RNA/peptide complex coacervation as a model for intracellular liquid organelles

Biological cells are highly organized, with numerous subcellular compartments. Phosphorylation has been hypothesized as a means to control the assembly/disassembly of liquid-like RNA- and protein-rich intracellular bodies, or liquid organelles, that lack delimiting membranes. Here, we demonstrate that charge-mediated phase separation, or complex coacervation, of RNAs with cationic peptides can generate simple model liquid organelles capable of reversibly compartmentalizing biomolecules. Formation and dissolution of these liquid bodies was controlled by changes in peptide phosphorylation state using a kinase/phosphatase enzyme pair. The droplet-generating phase transition responded to modification of even a single serine residue. Electrostatic interactions between the short cationic peptides and the much longer polyanionic RNAs drove phase separation. Coacervates were also formed on silica beads, a primitive model for localization at specific intracellular sites. This work supports phosphoregulation of complex coacervation as a viable mechanism for dynamic intracellular compartmentalization in membraneless organelles. Intracellular bodies called liquid organelles are rich in nucleic acids and proteins, and are thought to occur by liquid–liquid phase coexistence. Now, enzymatic control over the phosphorylation state of a simple cationic peptide, thereby altering its electrostatic interaction with RNA, has been shown to drive formation and dissolution of droplets that mimic these intracellular liquid bodies.

Mechanically controlled radical polymerization initiated by ultrasound

In polymer chemistry, mechanical energy degrades polymeric chains. In contrast, in nature, mechanical energy is often used to create new polymers. This mechanically stimulated growth is a key component of the robustness of biological materials. A synthetic system in which mechanical force initiates polymerization will provide similar robustness in polymeric materials. Here we show a polymerization of acrylate monomers initiated and controlled by mechanical energy provided by ultrasonic agitation. The activator for an atom-transfer radical polymerization is generated using piezochemical reduction of a Cu(II) precursor complex, which thus converts a mechanical activation of piezoelectric particles to the synthesis of a new material. This polymerization reaction has some characteristics of controlled radical polymerization, such as narrow molecular-weight distribution and linear dependence of the polymeric chain length on the time of mechanical activation. This new method of controlled radical polymerization complements the existing methods to synthesize commercially useful well-defined polymers. Mechanochemically controlled polymerization is rare in polymer chemistry. Now, it has been shown that mechanical force can initiate and control the polymerization of an acrylate monomer. Piezochemical reduction of a copper(II) precursor using mechanical agitation of piezoelectric nanoparticles generates the polymerization activator required for controlled radical polymerization.

Binary fluorous tagging enables the synthesis and separation of a 16-stereoisomer library of macrosphelides

Fluorous mixture synthesis minimizes the effort to synthesize small-molecule libraries by labelling the molecules rather than the reaction vessels. Reactants are labelled with fluorinated tags and products can later be demixed based on the fluorine content. A limit in the number of available tags can be overcome by using binary encoding so that a total of four tags can label uniquely a library of 16 compounds. This strategy, however, means that separation based on fluorine content alone is not possible. Here, we solve this problem by selectively removing one tag after an initial demixing step; a second demixing provides each individual compound. The usefulness of this strategy is demonstrated by the synthesis of a library that contains all 16 diastereomers of the natural products macrosphelides A and E. Macrosphelide D was not in this library, and so its assigned structure was incorrect. We determined its constitution by using NMR spectroscopy and its configuration by synthesizing four candidate stereoisomers. A 16-member diastereoisomer library known to contain macrosphelides A and E is synthesized as a mixture with the aid of a new encoding strategy for fluorous mixture synthesis. A simple process of sequential demixing and tag removal provides each of the isomers in individual, pure form. Analysis of the other library members ultimately leads to a structural reassignment for macrosphelide D.

Reactions of xenon with iron and nickel are predicted in the Earth's inner core

Studies of the Earth's atmosphere have shown that more than 90% of the expected amount of Xe is depleted, a finding often referred to as the ‘missing Xe paradox’. Although several models for a Xe reservoir have been proposed, whether the missing Xe could be contained in the Earth's inner core has not yet been answered. The key to addressing this issue lies in the reactivity of Xe with Fe/Ni, the main constituents of the Earth's core. Here, we predict, through first-principles calculations and unbiased structure searching techniques, a chemical reaction of Xe with Fe/Ni at the temperatures and pressures found in the Earth's core. We find that, under these conditions, Xe and Fe/Ni can form intermetallic compounds, of which XeFe3 and XeNi3 are energetically the most stable. This shows that the Earth's inner core is a natural reservoir for Xe storage and provides a solution to the missing Xe paradox. Studies of the Earth's atmosphere have shown that more than 90% of xenon is depleted — the so-called missing Xe paradox. Now a theoretical study shows that Xe and Fe/Ni can form inter-metallic compounds of XeFe3 and XeNi3 under conditions found in the Earth's inner core, and could provide a solution to the puzzle.

Electrode-assisted catalytic water oxidation by a flavin derivative

The success of solar fuel technology relies on the development of efficient catalysts that can oxidize or reduce water. All molecular water-oxidation catalysts reported thus far are transition-metal complexes, however, here we report catalytic water oxidation to give oxygen by a fully organic compound, the N(5)-ethylflavinium ion, Et-Fl+. Evolution of oxygen was detected during bulk electrolysis of aqueous Et-Fl+ solutions at several potentials above +1.9&nbsp;V versus normal hydrogen electrode. The catalysis was found to occur on glassy carbon and platinum working electrodes, but no catalysis was observed on fluoride-doped tin-oxide electrodes. Based on spectroelectrochemical results and preliminary calculations with density functional theory, one possible mechanistic route is proposed in which the oxygen evolution occurs from a peroxide intermediate formed between the oxidized flavin pseudobase and the oxidized carbon electrode. These findings offer an organic alternative to the traditional water-oxidation catalysts based on transition metals. So far, reports of molecular electrochemical water oxidation have involved catalytic transition metal complexes. Now it is demonstrated that water can be oxidized, and oxygen evolved, using a simple organic, flavin derivative.

Design of multi-phase dynamic chemical networks

Template-directed polymerization reactions enable the accurate storage and processing of nature's biopolymer information. This mutualistic relationship of nucleic acids and proteins, a network known as life's central dogma, is now marvellously complex, and the progressive steps necessary for creating the initial sequence and chain-length-specific polymer templates are lost to time. Here we design and construct dynamic polymerization networks that exploit metastable prion cross-β phases. Mixed-phase environments have been used for constructing synthetic polymers, but these dynamic phases emerge naturally from the growing peptide oligomers and create environments suitable both to nucleate assembly and select for ordered templates. The resulting templates direct the amplification of a phase containing only chain-length-specific peptide-like oligomers. Such multi-phase biopolymer dynamics reveal pathways for the emergence, self-selection and amplification of chain-length- and possibly sequence-specific biopolymers. Di- and tripeptide building blocks in which the C-terminus has been converted into an aldehyde are shown to form dynamic chemical networks through imine condensation followed by the formation of cyclic N,N-acetals. The networks exhibit multi-phase growth of prion-like assemblies that template the formation of chain-length-specific peptide-like oligomers.

Time-resolved observations of water oxidation intermediates on a cobalt oxide nanoparticle catalyst

In any artificial photosynthetic system, the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen provides the electrons needed for the reduction of protons or carbon dioxide to a fuel. Understanding how this four-electron reaction works in detail is important for the development of improved robust catalysts made of Earth-abundant materials, like first-row transition-metal oxides. Here, using time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and under reaction conditions, we identify intermediates of water oxidation catalysed by an abundant metal-oxide catalyst, cobalt oxide (Co3O4). One intermediate is a surface superoxide (three-electron oxidation intermediate absorbing at 1,013&nbsp;cm−1), whereas a second observed intermediate is attributed to an oxo Co(IV) site (one-electron oxidation intermediate absorbing at 840&nbsp;cm−1). The temporal behaviour of the intermediates reveals that they belong to different catalytic sites. Knowledge of the structure and kinetics of surface intermediates will enable the design of improved metal-oxide materials for more efficient water oxidation catalysis. The conversion of water to oxygen is an essential process for both natural and artificial photosynthesis. Important intermediates in the stepwise mechanism of water oxidation on the surface of cobalt oxide have now been spectroscopically identified, providing key insights for the development of higher-efficiency catalysts made from Earth-abundant materials.

Self-assembling hydrogel scaffolds for photocatalytic hydrogen production

Integration into a soft material of all the molecular components necessary to generate storable fuels is an interesting target in supramolecular chemistry. The concept is inspired by the internal structure of photosynthetic organelles, such as plant chloroplasts, which colocalize molecules involved in light absorption, charge transport and catalysis to create chemical bonds using light energy. We report here on the light-driven production of hydrogen inside a hydrogel scaffold built by the supramolecular self-assembly of a perylene monoimide amphiphile. The charged ribbons formed can electrostatically attract a nickel-based catalyst, and electrolyte screening promotes gelation. We found the emergent phenomenon that screening by the catalyst or the electrolytes led to two-dimensional crystallization of the chromophore assemblies and enhanced the electronic coupling among the molecules. Photocatalytic production of hydrogen is observed in the three-dimensional environment of the hydrogel scaffold and the material is easily placed on surfaces or in the pores of solid supports. Self-assembled ribbons of perylene amphiphiles have been shown to crystallize in the presence of a nickel-based hydrogen production catalyst, allowing efficient electronic coupling between the perylene chromophores. This hydrogel material photocatalyses the production of H2, and can be shaped and placed on surfaces for incorporation into devices.

Electronic tuning of site-selectivity

Site-selective functionalizations of complex small molecules can generate targeted derivatives with exceptional step efficiency, but general strategies for maximizing selectivity in this context are rare. Here, we report that site-selectivity can be tuned by simply modifying the electronic nature of the reagents. A Hammett analysis is consistent with linking this phenomenon to the Hammond postulate: electronic tuning to a more product-like transition state amplifies site-discriminating interactions between a reagent and its substrate. This strategy transformed a minimally site-selective acylation reaction into a highly selective and thus preparatively useful one. Electronic tuning of both an acylpyridinium donor and its carboxylate counterion further promoted site-divergent functionalizations. With these advances, we achieve a range of modifications to just one of the many hydroxyl groups appended to the ion channel-forming natural product amphotericin B. Thus, electronic tuning of reagents represents an effective strategy for discovering and optimizing site-selective functionalization reactions. Site-selective functionalizations of complex small molecules can generate targeted derivatives with exceptional step-efficiency, but general strategies for maximizing selectivity in this context are rare. Investigations with the ion-channel-forming natural product amphotericin B have revealed that site-selectivity can be tuned by simply modifying the electronic nature of the reagents.

Water lubricates hydrogen-bonded molecular machines

The mechanical behaviour of molecular machines differs greatly from that of their macroscopic counterparts. This applies particularly when considering concepts such as friction and lubrication, which are key to optimizing the operation of macroscopic machinery. Here, using time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy and NMR-lineshape analysis, we show that for molecular machinery consisting of hydrogen-bonded components the relative motion of the components is accelerated strongly by adding small amounts of water. The translation of a macrocycle along a thread and the rotation of a molecular wheel around an axle both accelerate significantly on the addition of water, whereas other protic liquids have much weaker or opposite effects. We tentatively assign the superior accelerating effect of water to its ability to form a three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network between the moving parts of the molecular machine. These results may indicate a more general phenomenon that helps explain the function of water as the ‘lubricant of life’. Although much is understood about the mechanical behaviour of macroscopic machinery, less is known about their molecular equivalents. It is now shown that for molecular machinery consisting of hydrogen-bonded components their relative motion is strongly accelerated by adding small amounts of ‘lubricating’ water, whereas other protic liquids have much weaker or opposite effects.

Synthesis of ‘unfeasible’ zeolites

Zeolites are porous aluminosilicate materials that have found applications in many different technologies. However, although simulations suggest that there are millions of possible zeolite topologies, only a little over 200 zeolite frameworks of all compositions are currently known, of which about 50 are pure silica materials. This is known as the zeolite conundrum—why have so few of all the possible structures been made? Several criteria have been formulated to explain why most zeolites are unfeasible synthesis targets. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of two such ‘unfeasible’ zeolites, IPC-9 and IPC-10, through the assembly–disassembly–organization–reassembly mechanism. These new high-silica zeolites have rare characteristics, such as windows that comprise odd-membered rings. Their synthesis opens up the possibility of preparing other zeolites that have not been accessible by traditional solvothermal synthetic methods. We envisage that these findings may lead to a step change in the number and types of zeolites available for future applications. Although millions of zeolite structures have been predicted, only about 200 have been prepared over the past six decades. An assembly–disassembly–organization–reassembly process has now enabled the synthesis of two zeolites previously thought to be unfeasible, which have high framework energy and rare structural features such as odd-membered rings.

Fast and selective ring-opening polymerizations by alkoxides and thioureas

Ring-opening polymerization of lactones is a versatile approach to generate well-defined functional polyesters. Typical ring-opening catalysts are subject to a trade-off between rate and selectivity. Here we describe an effective catalytic system combining alkoxides with thioureas that catalyses rapid and selective ring-opening polymerizations. Deprotonation of thioureas by sodium, potassium or imidazolium alkoxides generates a hydrogen-bonded alcohol adduct of the thiourea anion (thioimidate). The ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide mediated by these alcohol-bonded thioimidates yields highly isotactic polylactide with fast kinetics and living polymerization behaviour, as evidenced by narrow molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn &lt; 1.1), chain extension experiments and minimal transesterifications. Computational studies indicate a bifunctional catalytic mechanism whereby the thioimidate activates the carbonyl of the monomer and the alcohol initiator/chain end to effect the selective ring-opening of lactones and carbonates. The high selectivity of the catalyst towards monomer propagation over transesterification is attributed to a selective activation of monomer over polymer chains. By simply deprotonating a neutral hydrogen-bond donor thiourea it is possible to generate a class of highly efficient and tunable thioimidates that can simultaneously activate a pro-nucleophile and an electrophile. These bifunctional thioimidates exhibit fast kinetics and high selectivity for ring-opening polymerizations of cyclic lactones and carbonates.

Seven enzymes create extraordinary molecular complexity in an uncultivated bacterium

Uncultivated bacteria represent a massive resource of new enzymes and bioactive metabolites, but such bacteria remain functionally enigmatic. Polytheonamides are potent peptide cytotoxins produced by uncultivated bacteria that exist as symbionts in a marine sponge. Outside glycobiology, polytheonamides represent the most heavily post-translationally modified biomolecules that are derived from amino acids. The biosynthesis of polytheonamides involves up to 50 site-specific modifications to create a membrane-spanning β-helical structure. Here, we provide functional evidence that only seven enzymes are necessary for this process. They iteratively catalyse epimerization, methylation and hydroxylation of diverse amino acids. To reconstitute C-methylation, we employed the rarely used heterologous host Rhizobium leguminosarum to invoke the activities of two cobalamin-dependent C-methyltransferases. We observed 44 of the modifications to systematically unravel the biosynthesis of one of the most densely modified and metabolically obscure ribosome-derived molecules found in nature. Polytheonamides are giant peptide toxins produced by the uncultivated sponge bacterium Entotheonella factor. The biosynthesis of polytheonamides involves up to 50 post-translational modifications. Now, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and Rhizobium hosts have shown that a minimalistic, iterative enzyme set introduces this exceptional molecular complexity via epimerizations, C-/N-methylations, hydroxylations, dehydration and proteolytic maturation.

Title: 
Self-assembly of the oxy-tyrosinase core and the fundamental components of phenolic hydroxylation

The enzyme tyrosinase contains two CuI centres, trigonally coordinated by imidazole nitrogens of six conserved histidine residues. The enzyme activates O2 to form a µ-η2:η2-peroxo–dicopper(II) core, which hydroxylates tyrosine to a catechol in the first committed step of melanin biosynthesis. Here, we report a family of synthetic peroxo complexes, with spectroscopic and chemical features consistent with those of oxygenated tyrosinase, formed through the self-assembly of monodentate imidazole ligands, CuI and O2 at −125&nbsp;°C. An extensively studied complex reproduces the enzymatic electrophilic oxidation of exogenous phenolic substrates to catechols in good stoichiometric yields. The self-assembly and subsequent reactivity support the intrinsic stability of the Cu2O2 core with imidazole ligation, in the absence of a polypeptide framework, and the innate capacity to effect hydroxylation of phenolic substrates. These observations suggest that a foundational role of the protein matrix is to facilitate expression of properties native to the core by bearing the entropic costs of assembly and precluding undesired oxidative degradation pathways. A functional active-site mimic of the oxy-tyrosinase enzyme forms through self-assembly of monodentate imidazole ligands, copper(I) and oxygen at −125 °C. The fidelity of this copper–dioxygen complex to the native enzyme, its inherent stability and hydroxylation reactivity suggest that an organizational role of the protein matrix suffices to realize function.

Title: 
Iterative assembly line synthesis of polypropionates with full stereocontrol

The polypropionate motif is ubiquitous, being characteristic of the most important family of natural products for human health, the polyketides. Numerous strategies have been devised to construct these molecules with high stereocontrol, but certain stereoisomers remain challenging to prepare. We now describe the development of an iterative assembly line strategy for the construction of polypropionates. An assembly line strategy for the synthesis of deoxypolypropionates has already been described. However, the introduction of carbinol units required the development of new building blocks and new reaction conditions. This has been achieved by the use of enantioenriched lithiated α-chlorosilanes [1-((2′-lithiochloromethyldimethylsilyl)-methyl)-2-(methoxymethyl)-pyrrolidine], thus enabling the programmed synthesis of polypropionates in a fully stereocontrolled manner, including the stereochemically challenging anti–anti isomers. The versatility of the approach is exemplified in its extension to the synthesis of 1,3-related polyols. The methodology now allows access to a much wider family of polyketide natural products with stereochemistry being dialled in at will. Polypropionates can be grown — one carbon atom at a time — using the iterative homologation of boronic esters. This assembly line strategy was enabled through the use of enantioenriched lithiated α-chlorosilanes as masked carbinol units. Polypropionates were obtained in a fully stereocontrolled manner, including the stereochemically challenging anti–anti isomers.

Title: 
A redox hydrogel protects hydrogenase from high-potential deactivation and oxygen damage

Hydrogenases are nature's efficient catalysts for both the generation of energy via oxidation of molecular hydrogen and the production of hydrogen via the reduction of protons. However, their O2 sensitivity and deactivation at high potential limit their applications in practical devices, such as fuel cells. Here, we show that the integration of an O2-sensitive hydrogenase into a specifically designed viologen-based redox polymer protects the enzyme from O2 damage and high-potential deactivation. Electron transfer between the polymer-bound viologen moieties controls the potential applied to the active site of the hydrogenase and thus insulates the enzyme from excessive oxidative stress. Under catalytic turnover, electrons provided from the hydrogen oxidation reaction induce viologen-catalysed O2 reduction at the polymer surface, thus providing self-activated protection from O2. The advantages of this tandem protection are demonstrated using a single-compartment biofuel cell based on an O2-sensitive hydrogenase and H2/O2 mixed feed under anode-limiting conditions. Hydrogenases are efficient and promising catalysts for fuel cells; however, they suffer from oxygen sensitivity and deactivation at high potentials. Integration of hydrogenases into redox-active hydrogels provides a redox buffer and a self-activated oxygen-scavenging mechanism. This tandem protection makes the hydrogenase a possible alternative to noble metal catalysts.

Unimolecular dissociation dynamics of vibrationally activated CH3CHOO Criegee intermediates to OH radical products

The hydroxyl radical is an important atmospheric oxidant, and a significant source of its production occurs through alkene ozonolysis. This takes place via a cycloaddition reaction and subsequent fragmentation to form an energized carbonyl oxide (for example, CH3CHOO), known as a Criegee intermediate, which can then either react with another atmospheric species or decay and, in doing so, produce the hydroxyl radical. Here, we examine the dissociation dynamics of a prototypical Criegee intermediate by characterizing the translational and internal energy distributions of the OH radical products, which reflect critical configurations along the reaction pathway. Experimentally, the kinetic energy release to OH products is ascertained through velocity map imaging. Theoretically, quasi-classical trajectories are performed on a new full-dimensional, ab initio potential energy surface. Both experiment and theory show that most of the available energy flows into internal excitation of the vinoxy products. The isotropic angular distribution of OH fragments indicates that dissociation occurs in ≥2 ps, in agreement with theory. An important source of atmospheric hydroxyl radicals is from the dissociation of Criegee intermediates produced in alkene ozonolysis reactions. The dissociation dynamics of the prototypical CH3CHOO Criegee intermediate have now been determined. Complementary experimental and theoretical studies were carried out and the translational and internal energy distributions of the OH radical products were characterized.

Title: 
Quantum interference between H + D2 quasiclassical reaction mechanisms

Interferences are genuine quantum phenomena that appear whenever two seemingly distinct classical trajectories lead to the same outcome. They are common in elastic scattering but are seldom observable in chemical reactions. Here we report experimental measurements of the state-to-state angular distribution for the H + D2 reaction using the ‘photoloc’ technique. For products in low rotational and vibrational states, a characteristic oscillation pattern governs backward scattering. The comparison between the experiments, rigorous quantum calculations and classical trajectories on an accurate potential energy surface allows us to trace the origin of that structure to the quantum interference between different quasiclassical mechanisms, a phenomenon analogous to that observed in the double-slit experiment. Often reactions can be described by classical mechanics; however, this is prohibited in cases in which quantum phenomena emerge. Now angular distributions measured for the H + D2 reaction have been seen to display characteristic oscillation patterns in backward scattering — theory shows that they are caused by quantum interferences between classical mechanisms similar to those found in the double-slit experiment.

Title: 
Single-molecule interrogation of a bacterial sugar transporter allows the discovery of an extracellular inhibitor

Capsular polysaccharides form the outermost protective layer around many Gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotics aimed directly at weakening this layer are not yet available. In pathogenic Escherichia coli E69, a protein, Wza, forms a pore in the outer membrane that transports K30 capsular polysaccharide from its site of synthesis to the outside of the cell. This therefore represents a prospective antibiotic target. Here we test a variety of grommet-like mimics of K30 capsular polysaccharide on wild-type Wza and on mutant open forms of the pore by electrical recording in planar lipid bilayers. The most effective glycomimetic was the unnatural cyclic octasaccharide octakis(6-deoxy-6-amino)cyclomaltooctaose (am8γCD), which blocks the α-helix barrel of Wza, a site that is directly accessible from the external medium. This glycomimetic inhibited K30 polysaccharide transport in live E. coli E69. With the protective outer membrane disrupted, the bacteria can be recognized and killed by the human immune system. Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) enclose many pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, protecting the bacteria from the host. Here, an extracellular blocker of Wza, a pore-forming protein that transports CPS to the cell surface, has been discovered by single-channel electrical recording. Treatment with the blocker exposes the bacterial cell surface and thereby facilitates killing by the human immune system.

Quantitative mapping of zinc fluxes in the mammalian egg reveals the origin of fertilization-induced zinc sparks

Fertilization of a mammalian egg initiates a series of ‘zinc sparks’ that are necessary to induce the egg-to-embryo transition. Despite the importance of these zinc-efflux events little is known about their origin. To understand the molecular mechanism of the zinc spark we combined four physical approaches that resolve zinc distributions in single cells: a chemical probe for dynamic live-cell fluorescence imaging and a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional elemental tomography for high-resolution elemental mapping. We show that the zinc spark arises from a system of thousands of zinc-loaded vesicles, each of which contains, on average, 106 zinc atoms. These vesicles undergo dynamic movement during oocyte maturation and exocytosis at the time of fertilization. The discovery of these vesicles and the demonstration that zinc sparks originate from them provides a quantitative framework for understanding how zinc fluxes regulate cellular processes. The mammalian oocyte cell cycle is regulated by massive zinc fluxes which culminate in coordinated ejections of ~1010 zinc ions at fertilization. Four single-cell physiochemical approaches (live-cell fluorescence imaging, scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence microscopy and tomography) reveal that these ‘zinc sparks’ originate from thousands of cortical vesicles which each release ~106 zinc ions.

Title: 
Microscopic origin of chiral shape induction in achiral crystals

In biomineralization, inorganic materials are formed with remarkable control of the shape and morphology. Chirality, as present in the biomolecular world, is therefore also common for biominerals. Biomacromolecules, like proteins and polysaccharides, are in direct contact with the mineral phase and act as modifiers during nucleation and crystal growth. Owing to their homochirality—they exist only as one of two possible mirror-symmetric isomers—their handedness is often transferred into the macroscopic shape of the biomineral crystals, but the way in which handedness is transmitted into achiral materials is not yet understood at the atomic level. By using the submolecular resolution capability of scanning tunnelling microscopy, supported by photoelectron diffraction and density functional theory, we show how the chiral ‘buckybowl’ hemibuckminsterfullerene arranges copper surface atoms in its vicinity into a chiral morphology. We anticipate that such new insight will find its way into materials synthesis techniques. Achiral minerals often adopt a chiral shape when crystal growth proceeds in contact with chiral molecules. Now, detailed microscopic insight is provided into how the chiral footprint of hemifullerene (a buckybowl that is essentially half of C60) rearranges atoms at step edges on a copper surface into chiral motifs.

Mechanically interlocked daisy-chain-like structures as multidimensional molecular muscles

Daisy chains (DCs) are garlands of flowers that can be worn as bracelets and necklaces. As a result of their beautiful interlocked structures and possible muscle-like motions, cyclic molecular DCs ([cn]DCs, where n is the number of repeating units) have long been attractive synthetic targets for supramolecular chemists. Herein we report artificial molecular muscles that—unlike one-dimensional (1D) biological muscles—contract and stretch in 2D or 3D. These systems have the structures of [c3]- and [c4]DCs with subcomponents that operate as molecular switches, powered through the addition or removal of Zn2+ ions to impart muscle-like behaviour. We assembled these [c3]- and [c4]DCs selectively by exploiting structural rigidity, coordination geometries and bond rotational barriers that disfavoured the formation of smaller homologues. The switching phenomena of our [c3]- and [c4]DCs resulted in the contracted molecular muscles stretching by approximately 23 and 36%, respectively, comparable to the value (27%) for linear biological muscles. By exploiting structural rigidity, coordination geometries and bond rotational barriers that disfavour the formation of smaller homologues, molecular switches based on [c3] and [c4]daisy chains have been assembled selectively; they display muscle-like motion in multiple dimensions with changes in length of approximately 23% and 36%, respectively.

Directing the path of light-induced electron transfer at a molecular fork using vibrational excitation

Ultrafast electron transfer in condensed-phase molecular systems is often strongly coupled to intramolecular vibrations that can promote, suppress and direct electronic processes. Recent experiments exploring this phenomenon proved that light-induced electron transfer can be strongly modulated by vibrational excitation, suggesting a new avenue for active control over molecular function. Here, we achieve the first example of such explicit vibrational control through judicious design of a Pt(II)-acetylide charge-transfer donor–bridge–acceptor–bridge–donor ‘fork’ system: asymmetric 13C isotopic labelling of one of the two –C≡C– bridges makes the two parallel and otherwise identical donor→acceptor electron-transfer pathways structurally distinct, enabling independent vibrational perturbation of either. Applying an ultrafast UVpump(excitation)–IRpump(perturbation)–IRprobe(monitoring) pulse sequence, we show that the pathway that is vibrationally perturbed during UV-induced electron transfer is dramatically slowed down compared to its unperturbed counterpart. One can thus choose the dominant electron transfer pathway. The findings deliver a new opportunity for precise perturbative control of electronic energy propagation in molecular devices. With recent and improved understanding of how nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom can interact with each other comes the opportunity to directly control electronic processes. Now it has been shown that ultrafast vibrational excitation can direct light-induced intramolecular electron transfer along a specific path.

Title: 
Kinetic pathway for interfacial electron transfer from a semiconductor to a molecule

Molecular approaches to solar-energy conversion require a kinetic optimization of light-induced electron-transfer reactions. At molecular–semiconductor interfaces, this optimization has previously been accomplished through control of the distance between the semiconductor donor and the molecular acceptor and/or the free energy that accompanies electron transfer. Here we show that a kinetic pathway for electron transfer from a semiconductor to a molecular acceptor also exists and provides an alternative method for the control of interfacial kinetics. The pathway was identified by the rational design of molecules in which the distance and the driving force were held near parity and only the geometric torsion about a xylyl- or phenylthiophene bridge was varied. Electronic coupling through the phenyl bridge was a factor of ten greater than that through the xylyl bridge. Comparative studies revealed a significant bridge dependence for electron transfer that could not be rationalized by a change in distance or driving force. Instead, the data indicate an interfacial electron-transfer pathway that utilizes the aromatic bridge orbitals. While important for solar energy conversion, it is unclear whether electron transfer at molecular–semiconductor interfaces is influenced only by the distance over which the injected electron tunnels and whether specific through-bond pathways are active. Now, a pathway for electron transfer has been identified through comparative analysis of compounds with phenyl- or xylyl-thiophene bridges.

Exceptionally fast carbon–carbon bond reductive elimination from gold(III)

Reductive elimination of carbon–carbon bonds occurs in numerous metal-catalysed reactions. This process is well documented for a variety of transition metal complexes. However, carbon–carbon bond reductive elimination from a limited number of Au(III) complexes has been shown to be a slow and prohibitive process that generally requires elevated temperatures. Herein we show that oxidation of a series of mono- and bimetallic Au(I) aryl complexes at low temperature generates observable Au(III) and Au(II) intermediates. We also show that aryl–aryl bond reductive elimination from these oxidized species is not only among the fastest observed for any transition metal, but is also mechanistically distinct from previously studied alkyl–alkyl and aryl–alkyl reductive eliminations from Au(III). Mechanistic studies of reductive elimination that forms aryl–aryl bonds from simple mono- and dinuclear gold phosphine complexes are disclosed. The observed rates for reductive elimination are unusually fast, even at temperatures as low as –52&nbsp;°C, providing insight into the fundamental reactivity of oxidized organogold complexes.

Guided desaturation of unactivated aliphatics

The excision of hydrogen from an aliphatic carbon chain to produce an isolated olefin (desaturation) without overoxidation is one of the most impressive and powerful biosynthetic transformations for which there are no simple and mild laboratory substitutes. The versatility of olefins and the range of reactions they undergo are unsurpassed in functional group space. Thus, the conversion of a relatively inert aliphatic system into its unsaturated counterpart could open new possibilities in retrosynthesis. In this article, the invention of a directing group to achieve such a transformation under mild, operationally simple, metal-free conditions is outlined. This ‘portable desaturase’ (TzoCl) is a bench-stable, commercial entity (Aldrich, catalogue number L510092) that is facile to install on alcohol and amine functionalities to ultimately effect remote desaturation, while leaving behind a synthetically useful tosyl group. A bench-stable, aryl sulfonyl triazene is described that can be appended to alcohols or amines and used as a directing group to effect remote desaturation of unactivated aliphatics to produce olefins. The reaction is mild, operationally simple, requires no added metals and produces unsaturated tosylates or tosylamides available for further functionalization.

Biomimetic radical polymerization via cooperative assembly of segregating templates

Segregation and templating approaches have been honed by billions of years of evolution to direct many complex biological processes. Nature uses segregation to improve biochemical control by organizing reactants into defined, well-regulated environments, and the transfer of genetic information is a primary function of templating. The ribosome, wherein messenger RNA is translated into polypeptides, combines both techniques to allow for ideal biopolymer syntheses. Herein is presented a biomimetic segregation/templating approach to synthetic radical polymerization. Polymerization of a nucleobase-containing vinyl monomer in the presence of a complementary block copolymer template of low molecular weight yields high molecular weight (Mw up to ~400,000&nbsp;g mol−1), extremely low polydispersity (≤1.08) daughter polymers. Control is attained by segregation of propagating radicals in discrete micelle cores (via cooperative assembly of dynamic template polymers). Significantly reduced bimolecular termination, combined with controlled propagation along a defined number of templates, ensures unprecedented control to afford well-defined high molecular weight polymers. Nature synthesizes proteins and nucleic acids by polymerization methods that use well-regulated and segregated templates. Now, synthetic block-copolymer templates have been designed to assemble in a biomimetic fashion to segregate, and thus control, the synthetic radical polymerization of complementary nucleobase-containing vinyl monomers, to yield high-molecular-weight, low-polydispersity polymer chains.

Intermediate tunnelling–hopping regime in DNA charge transport

Charge transport in molecular systems, including DNA, is involved in many basic chemical and biological processes, and its understanding is critical if they are to be used in electronic devices. This important phenomenon is often described as either coherent tunnelling over a short distance or incoherent hopping over a long distance. Here, we show evidence of an intermediate regime where coherent and incoherent processes coexist in double-stranded DNA. We measure charge transport in single DNA molecules bridged to two electrodes as a function of DNA sequence and length. In general, the resistance of DNA increases linearly with length, as expected for incoherent hopping. However, for DNA sequences with stacked guanine–cytosine (GC) base pairs, a periodic oscillation is superimposed on the linear length dependence, indicating partial coherent transport. This result is supported by the finding of strong delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbitals of GC by theoretical simulation and by modelling based on the Büttiker theory of partial coherent charge transport. Charge transport in molecular systems is typically through coherent tunnelling over a short distance or incoherent hopping over a long distance. An intermediate regime between those two transport mechanisms has now been found for DNA systems with stacked guanine–cytosine sequences.

A synthetic molecular system capable of mirror-image genetic replication and transcription

The overwhelmingly homochiral nature of life has left a puzzle as to whether mirror-image biological systems based on a chirally inverted version of molecular machinery could also have existed. Here we report that two key steps in the central dogma of molecular biology, the template-directed polymerization of DNA and transcription into RNA, can be catalysed by a chemically synthesized D-amino acid polymerase on an L-DNA template. We also show that two chirally mirrored versions of the 174-residue African swine fever virus polymerase X could operate in a racemic mixture without significant enantiomeric cross-inhibition to the activity of each other. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a functionally active L-DNAzyme could be enzymatically produced using the D-amino acid polymerase. The establishment of such molecular systems with an opposite handedness highlights the potential to exploit enzymatically produced mirror-image biomolecules as research and therapeutic tools. A mirror-image polymerase—a version of African swine fever virus polymerase X made from D-amino acids—has now been chemically synthesized. This polymerase can catalyse template-directed L-DNA replication and transcription from L-DNA into L-RNA. These reactions represent two key steps in the central dogma of molecular biology—but demonstrated using the opposite chirality.

Cytocompatible click-based hydrogels with dynamically tunable properties through orthogonal photoconjugation and photocleavage reactions

To provide insight into how cells receive information from their external surroundings, synthetic hydrogels have emerged as systems for assaying cell function in well-defined microenvironments where single cues can be introduced and subsequent effects individually elucidated. However, as answers to more complex biological questions continue to be sought, advanced material systems are needed that allow dynamic alteration of the three-dimensional cellular environment with orthogonal reactions that enable multiple levels of control of biochemical and biomechanical signals. Here, we seek to synthesize one such three-dimensional culture system using cytocompatible and wavelength-specific photochemical reactions to create hydrogels that allow orthogonal and dynamic control of material properties through independent spatiotemporally regulated photocleavage of crosslinks and photoconjugation of pendant functionalities. The results demonstrate the versatile nature of the chemistry to create programmable niches to study and direct cell function by modifying the local hydrogel environment. Cell-laden synthetic hydrogels — formed via a copper-free click reaction between a poly(ethylene glycol) tetra-cyclooctyne and a peptide-diazide — provide a platform to investigate the cells' response to various stimuli during growth. The hydrogel's biochemical aspects are readily controlled by a thiol-ene photocoupling reaction initiated with visible light, whereas the biomechanical properties of the network are altered via a UV-mediated photodegradation.

A triaxial supramolecular weave

Despite recent advances in the synthesis of increasingly complex topologies at the molecular level, nano- and microscopic weaves have remained difficult to achieve. Only a few diaxial molecular weaves exist—these were achieved by templation with metals. Here, we present an extended triaxial supramolecular weave that consists of self-assembled organic threads. Each thread is formed by the self-assembly of a building block comprising a rigid oligoproline segment with two perylene-monoimide chromophores spaced at 18 Å. Upon π stacking of the chromophores, threads form that feature alternating up- and down-facing voids at regular distances. These voids accommodate incoming building blocks and establish crossing points through CH–π interactions on further assembly of the threads into a triaxial woven superstructure. The resulting micrometre-scale supramolecular weave proved to be more robust than non-woven self-assemblies of the same building block. The uniform hexagonal pores of the interwoven network were able to host iridium nanoparticles, which may be of interest for practical applications. Woven topologies endow macroscopic objects with mechanical stability, but their molecular counterparts have remained difficult to prepare. Now, an extended triaxial supramolecular weave has been formed by the self-assembly of a judiciously shaped organic building block — a rigid oligoproline segment featuring two perylene-monoimide moieties — through π–π stacking and CH–π interactions.

Bioinspired chemical synthesis of monomeric and dimeric stephacidin A congeners

Stephacidin A and its congeners are a collection of secondary metabolites that possess intriguing structural motifs. They stem from unusual biosynthetic sequences that lead to the incorporation of a prenyl or reverse-prenyl group into a bicyclo[2.2.2]diazaoctane framework, a chromene unit or the vestige thereof. To complement biosynthetic studies, which normally play a significant role in unveiling the biosynthetic pathways of natural products, here we demonstrate that chemical synthesis can provide important insights into biosynthesis. We identify a short total synthesis of congeners in the reverse-prenylated indole alkaloid family related to stephacidin A by taking advantage of a direct indole C6 halogenation of the related ketopremalbrancheamide. This novel strategic approach has now made possible the syntheses of several natural products, including malbrancheamides B and C, notoamides F, I and R, aspergamide B, and waikialoid A, which is a heterodimer of avrainvillamide and aspergamide B. Our approach to the preparation of these prenylated and reverse-prenylated indole alkaloids is bioinspired, and may also inform the as-yet undetermined biosynthesis of several congeners. The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as stephacidin A and its congeners continues to intrigue both biochemists and synthetic chemists. Now, a laboratory chemical synthesis of these natural products has been achieved based on a bioinspired synthetic strategy, which may provide key insights into the possible biosynthesis of these captivating molecules.

Synthesis of 19-substituted geldanamycins with altered conformations and their binding to heat shock protein Hsp90

The benzoquinone ansamycin geldanamycin and its derivatives are inhibitors of heat shock protein Hsp90, an emerging target for novel therapeutic agents both in cancer and in neurodegeneration. However, the toxicity of these compounds to normal cells has been ascribed to reaction with thiol nucleophiles at the quinone 19-position. We reasoned that blocking this position would ameliorate toxicity, and that it might also enforce a favourable conformational switch of the trans-amide group into the cis-form required for protein binding. Here, we report an efficient synthesis of such 19-substituted compounds and realization of our hypotheses. Protein crystallography established that the new compounds bind to Hsp90 with, as expected, a cis-amide conformation. Studies on Hsp90 inhibition in cells demonstrated the molecular signature of Hsp90 inhibitors: decreases in client proteins with compensatory increases in other heat shock proteins in both human breast cancer and dopaminergic neural cells, demonstrating their potential for use in the therapy of cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. The heat shock protein Hsp90 is a potential target for cancer and neurodegeneration drugs. Here, the introduction of a substituent into the 19-position of the naturally occurring inhibitor geldanamycin by chemical synthesis is shown to ameliorate toxicity, and also cause a favourable conformational switch that is required for protein binding.

A supramolecular approach to combining enzymatic and transition metal catalysis

The ability of supramolecular host–guest complexes to catalyse organic reactions collaboratively with an enzyme is an important goal in the research and discovery of synthetic enzyme mimics. Herein we present a variety of catalytic tandem reactions that employ esterases, lipases or alcohol dehydrogenases and gold(I) or ruthenium(II) complexes encapsulated in a Ga4L6 tetrahedral supramolecular cluster. The host–guest complexes are tolerated well by the enzymes and, in the case of the gold(I) host–guest complex, show improved reactivity relative to the free cationic guest. We propose that supramolecular encapsulation of organometallic complexes prevents their diffusion into the bulk solution, where they can bind amino-acid residues on the proteins and potentially compromise their activity. Our observations underline the advantages of the supramolecular approach and suggest that encapsulation of reactive complexes may provide a general strategy for carrying out classic organic reactions in the presence of biocatalysts. Combinations of enzymatic and chemo-catalysis can result in powerful synthetic transformations. Here, encapsulation of Au(I) or Ru(II) within a supramolecular assembly prevents diffusion of the organometallic complexes into solution where they can compromise the activity of an enzyme. This strategy has been applied to tandem reactions employing supramolecular host–guest complexes and enzymes in the catalysis of organic transformations.

Heterogenized cobalt oxide catalysts for nitroarene reduction by pyrolysis of molecularly defined complexes

Molecularly well-defined homogeneous catalysts are known for a wide variety of chemical transformations. The effect of small changes in molecular structure can be studied in detail and used to optimize many processes. However, many industrial processes require heterogeneous catalysts because of their stability, ease of separation and recyclability, but these are more difficult to control on a molecular level. Here, we describe the conversion of homogeneous cobalt complexes into heterogeneous cobalt oxide catalysts via immobilization and pyrolysis on activated carbon. The catalysts thus produced are useful for the industrially important reduction of nitroarenes to anilines. The ligand indirectly controls the selectivity and activity of the recyclable catalyst and catalyst optimization can be performed at the level of the solution-phase precursor before conversion into the active heterogeneous catalyst. Pyrolysis of defined nitrogen-ligated cobalt acetate complexes onto a commercial carbon support transforms the complexes into heterogeneous Co3O4 materials. These reusable non-noble-metal catalysts are highly selective for the industrially important hydrogenation of structurally diverse and functionalized nitroarenes to anilines.

In-ice evolution of RNA polymerase ribozyme activity

Mechanisms of molecular self-replication have the potential to shed light on the origins of life. In particular, self-replication through RNA-catalysed templated RNA synthesis is thought to have supported a primordial ‘RNA world’. However, existing polymerase ribozymes lack the capacity to synthesize RNAs approaching their own size. Here, we report the in vitro evolution of such catalysts directly in the RNA-stabilizing medium of water ice, which yielded RNA polymerase ribozymes specifically adapted to sub-zero temperatures and able to synthesize RNA in ices at temperatures as low as −19&nbsp;°C. The combination of cold-adaptive mutations with a previously described 5′&nbsp;extension operating at ambient temperatures enabled the design of a first polymerase ribozyme capable of catalysing the accurate synthesis of an RNA sequence longer than itself (adding up to 206 nucleotides), an important stepping stone towards RNA self-replication. Molecular self-replication through ribozyme-catalysed RNA synthesis could shed light on the origins of life. Here, a polymerase ribozyme capable of synthesizing an RNA sequence longer than itself is described, based on a cold-adapted ribozyme variant evolved in ice. This process demonstrates the potential for the emergence of novel ribozyme phenotypes in altered reaction environments.

Label-free measuring and mapping of binding kinetics of membrane proteins in single living cells

Membrane proteins mediate a variety of cellular responses to extracellular signals. Although membrane proteins are studied intensively for their values as disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets, in situ investigation of the binding kinetics of membrane proteins with their ligands has been a challenge. Traditional approaches isolate membrane proteins and then study them ex situ, which does not reflect accurately their native structures and functions. We present a label-free plasmonic microscopy method to map the local binding kinetics of membrane proteins in their native environment. This analytical method can perform simultaneous plasmonic and fluorescence imaging, and thus make it possible to combine the strengths of both label-based and label-free techniques in one system. Using this method, we determined the distribution of membrane proteins on the surface of single cells and the local binding kinetic constants of different membrane proteins. Furthermore, we studied the polarization of the membrane proteins on the cell surface during chemotaxis. Many biological processes involve the binding of proteins to cell membrane receptors, making these proteins valuable disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. A label-free plasmonic microscopy method has now been devised to determine the distribution and local binding kinetics of these ‘membrane proteins’, on the surface of single living cells rather than ex situ.

Title: 
Directed assembly of optoelectronically active alkyl–π-conjugated molecules by adding n-alkanes or π-conjugated species

Supramolecular assembly can yield ordered structures by taking advantage of the cumulative effect of multiple non-covalent interactions between adjacent molecules. The thermodynamic origin of many self-assembled structures in water is the balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments of the molecule. Here, we show that this approach can be generalized to use solvophobic and solvophilic segments of fully hydrophobic alkylated fullerene molecules. Addition of n-alkanes results in their assembly—due to the antipathy of C60 towards n-alkanes—into micelles and hexagonally packed gel-fibres containing insulated C60 nanowires. The addition of pristine C60 instead directs the assembly into lamellar mesophases by increasing the proportion of π-conjugated material in the mixture. The assembled structures contain a large fraction of optoelectronically active material and exhibit comparably high photoconductivities. This method is shown to be applicable to several alkyl–π-conjugated molecules, and can be used to construct organized functional materials with π-conjugated sections. Amphiphilic self-assembly usually involves molecules consisting of hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments. Now, this concept has been broadened to encompass the self-assembly of fully hydrophobic molecules that contain mutually immiscible alkyl and π-conjugated segments. Selective additives — n-alkanes or C60 — direct their assembly into various ordered and optoelectronically functional structures.

Switchable regioselectivity in amine-catalysed asymmetric cycloadditions

Building small-molecule libraries with structural and stereogenic diversity plays an important role in drug discovery. The development of switchable intermolecular cycloaddition reactions from identical substrates in different regioselective fashions would provide an attractive protocol. However, this also represents a challenge in organic chemistry, because it is difficult to control regioselectivity to afford the products exclusively and at the same time achieve high levels of stereoselectivity. Here, we report the diversified cycloadditions of α′-alkylidene-2-cyclopentenones catalysed by cinchona-derived primary amines. An asymmetric γ,β′-regioselective intermolecular [6+2] cycloaddition reaction with 3-olefinic (7-aza)oxindoles is realized through the in situ generation of formal 4-aminofulvenes, while a different β,γ-regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition reaction with maleimides to access fused cyclobutanes is disclosed. In contrast, an intriguing α,γ-regioselective [4+2] cycloaddition reaction is uncovered with the same set of substrates, by employing an unprecedented dual small-molecule catalysis of amines and thiols. All of the cycloaddition reactions exhibit excellent regio- and stereoselectivity, producing a broad spectrum of chiral architectures with high structural diversity and molecular complexity. The construction of diversified compound libraries from identical substrates is attractive but remains a challenge in asymmetric synthesis. Here, we demonstrate switchable regioselective [6+2], [4+2] or [2+2] cycloadditions with α′-alkylidene-2-cyclopentenones via mild aminocatalysis, producing a spectrum of chiral frameworks with high structural diversity and molecular complexity.

Title: 
An infinite chainmail of M6L6 metallacycles featuring multiple Borromean links

Borromean rings or links are topologically complex assemblies of three entangled rings where no two rings are interlinked in a chain-like catenane, yet the three rings cannot be separated. We report here a metallacycle complex whose crystalline network forms the first example of a new class of entanglement. The complex is formed from the self-assembly of CuBr2 with the cyclotriveratrylene-scaffold ligand (±)-tris(iso-nicotinoyl)cyclotriguaiacylene. Individual metallacycles are interwoven into a two-dimensional chainmail network where each metallacycle exhibits multiple Borromean-ring-like associations with its neighbours. This only occurs in the solid state, and also represents the first example of a crystalline infinite chainmail two-dimensional network. Crystals of the complex were twinned and have an unusual hollow tubular morphology that is likely to result from a localized dissolution-recrystallization process. Metallacycles made up of six copper ions and six cyclotriguaiacylene-based ligands form a unique topological entanglement in the solid state. Individual metallacycles are interwoven into an infinite 2D chainmail network where each one forms multiple Borromean-ring-like associations with its neighbours. Crystals of the complex grow in an unusual tubular morphology.

Title: 
Hydrolytic cleavage of both CS2 carbon–sulfur bonds by multinuclear Pd(II) complexes at room temperature

Developing homogeneous catalysts that convert CS2 and COS pollutants into environmentally benign products is important for both fundamental catalytic research and applied environmental science. Here we report a series of air-stable dimeric Pd complexes that mediate the facile hydrolytic cleavage of both CS2 carbon–sulfur bonds at 25 °C to produce CO2 and trimeric Pd complexes. Oxidation of the trimeric complexes with HNO3 regenerates the dimeric starting complexes with the release of SO2 and NO2. Isotopic labelling confirms that the carbon and oxygen atoms of CO2 originate from CS2 and H2O, respectively, and reaction intermediates were observed by gas-phase and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, as well as by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We also propose a plausible mechanistic scenario based on the experimentally observed intermediates. The mechanism involves intramolecular attack by a nucleophilic Pd–OH moiety on the carbon atom of coordinated µ-OCS2, which on deprotonation cleaves one C–S bond and simultaneously forms a C–O bond. Coupled C–S cleavage and CO2 release to yield [(bpy)3Pd3(µ3-S)2](NO3)2 (bpy, 2,2′-bipyridine) provides the thermodynamic driving force for the reaction. Converting CS2 and COS pollutants into benign products is critical in eliminating waste exhaust fumes. Now, a series of air-stable palladium complexes mediate hydrolysis of both CS2 carbon–sulfur bonds at 25 °C to produce CO2. Oxidation of the resulting complexes regenerates the starting complexes with SO2 and NO2 release.

Structure of a PEGylated protein reveals a highly porous double-helical assembly

PEGylated proteins are a mainstay of the biopharmaceutical industry. Although the use of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to increase particle size, stability and solubility is well-established, questions remain as to the structure of PEG–protein conjugates. Here we report the structural characterization of a model β-sheet protein (plastocyanin, 11.5 kDa) modified with a single PEG 5,000. An NMR spectroscopy study of the PEGylated conjugate indicated that the protein and PEG behaved as independent domains. A crystal structure revealed an extraordinary double-helical assembly of the conjugate, with the helices arranged orthogonally to yield a highly porous architecture. Electron density was not observed for the PEG chain, which indicates that it was disordered. The volume available per PEG chain in the crystal was within 10% of the calculated random coil volume. Together, these data support a minimal interaction between the protein and the synthetic polymer. Our work provides new possibilities for understanding this important class of protein–polymer hybrids and suggests a novel approach to engineering protein assemblies. Protein PEGylation is routinely used to produce molecules with improved pharmacokinetic properties. However, despite their importance, the structure of PEGylated proteins has remained elusive. Now, the first crystal structure of a model β-sheet protein modified with a single PEG chain has been reported. NMR spectroscopy data indicates that the protein and PEG behave as independent domains.

Title: 
Optochemical control of genetically engineered neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

Advances in synthetic chemistry, structural biology, molecular modelling and molecular cloning have enabled the systematic functional manipulation of transmembrane proteins. By combining genetically manipulated proteins with light-sensitive ligands, innately ‘blind’ neurobiological receptors can be converted into photoreceptors, which allows them to be photoregulated with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, we present the optochemical control of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with photoswitchable tethered agonists and antagonists. Using structure-based design, we produced heteromeric α3β4 and α4β2 nAChRs that can be activated or inhibited with deep-violet light, but respond normally to acetylcholine in the dark. The generation of these engineered receptors should facilitate investigation of the physiological and pathological functions of neuronal nAChRs and open a general pathway to photosensitizing pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Light-sensitive ligands can be used to regulate neurobiological receptors with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, the optochemical control of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, using both photoswitchable tethered agonists and antagonists, is described. These rationally designed hybrid photoreceptors will facilitate the investigation of the physiological and pathological functions of nicotinic receptors in the brain.

Title: 
Reactions of hexadehydro-Diels–Alder benzynes with structurally complex multifunctional natural products

An important question in organic chemistry concerns the extent to which benzynes—one of the classical reactive intermediates in organic chemistry—can react in discriminating fashion with trapping reagents. In particular, whether these species can react selectively with substrates containing multiple functional groups and possible sites of reactivity has remained unanswered. Natural products comprise a palette of multifunctional compounds with which to address this question. Here, we show that benzynes produced by the hexadehydro-Diels–Alder (HDDA) reaction react with many secondary metabolites with a preference for one among several pathways. Examples demonstrating such selectivity include reactions with: phenolics, through dearomatizing ortho-substitution; alkaloids, through Hofmann-type elimination; tropolone and furan, through cycloaddition; and alkaloids, through three-component fragmentation–coupling reactions. We also demonstrate that the cinchona alkaloids quinidine and quinine give rise to products (some in as few as three steps) that enable subsequent and rapid access to structurally diverse polyheterocyclic compounds. The results show that benzynes are quite discriminating in their reactivity—a trait perhaps not broadly enough appreciated. The development of methods for the site-selective modification of natural products is a topic of contemporary investigation and importance. Now, it has been shown that benzynes produced by the hexadehydro-Diels–­Alder (HDDA) reaction react with many secondary metabolites, with a substantial preference for one of several potential pathways.

Title: 
Direct observation of a borane–silane complex involved in frustrated Lewis-pair-mediated hydrosilylations

Perfluorarylborane Lewis acids catalyse the addition of silicon–hydrogen bonds across C=C, C=N and C=O double bonds. This ‘metal-free’ hydrosilylation has been proposed to occur via borane activation of the silane Si–H bond, rather than through classical Lewis acid/base adducts with the substrate. However, the key borane/silane adduct had not been observed experimentally. Here it is shown that the strongly Lewis acidic, antiaromatic 1,2,3-tris(pentafluorophenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrafluoro-1-boraindene forms an observable, isolable adduct with triethylsilane. The equilibrium for adduct formation was studied quantitatively through variable-temperature NMR spectroscopic investigations. The interaction of the silane with the borane occurs through the Si–H bond, as evidenced by trends in the Si–H coupling constant and the infrared stretching frequency of the Si–H bond, as well as by X-ray crystallography and theoretical calculations. The adduct's reactivity with nucleophiles demonstrates conclusively the role of this species in metal-free ‘frustrated-Lewis-pair’ hydrosilylation reactions. Comprehensive solution and solid-state characterization of an adduct between a Lewis acidic perfluoroaryl borane and an electron-rich silane is demonstrated. This has long been proposed as an intermediate in the ‘frustrated’ Lewis-pair hydrosilylation of C=C, C=O and C=N double bonds, but its existence has, so far, only been inferred from indirect experimental evidence.

Title: 
Site-specific positioning of dendritic alkyl chains on DNA cages enables their geometry-dependent self-assembly

Nature uses a combination of non-covalent interactions to create a hierarchy of complex systems from simple building blocks. One example is the selective association of the hydrophobic side chains that are a strong determinant of protein organization. Here, we report a parallel mode of assembly in DNA nanotechnology. Dendritic alkyl-DNA conjugates are hybridized to the edges of a DNA cube. When four amphiphiles are on one face, the hydrophobic residues of two neighbouring cubes engage in an intermolecular ‘handshake’, resulting in a dimer. When there are eight amphiphiles (four on the top and bottom cube faces, respectively), they engage in an intramolecular ‘handshake’ inside the cube. This forms the first example of a monodisperse micelle within a DNA nanostructure that encapsulates small molecules and releases them by DNA recognition. Creating a three-dimensional pattern of hydrophobic patches, like side chains in proteins, can result in specific, directed association of hydrophobic domains with orthogonal interactions to DNA base-pairing. The site-specific incorporation of dendritic DNA amphiphiles into a DNA cage controls whether the resultant structures show intermolecular self-assembly or intramolecular assembly. Intramolecular assembly creates a hydrophobic core within the cage that is capable of encapsulating small molecules. These molecules can be released on addition of specific DNA strands.

Inelastic scattering of hydroxyl radicals with helium and argon by velocity-map imaging

The hydroxyl radical (OH) is one of the most interesting molecules in molecular dynamics. In particular, inelastic collisions of free radicals such as OH are profoundly important in environments ranging from combustion to astrochemistry. However, measuring the velocities of OH molecules in specific internal quantum states has proven to be very difficult. A method that can provide this important information is velocity-map imaging. Although this technique is very widely applicable in principle, it does require a sensitive and selective laser-ionization scheme. Here we show that, under the right conditions, velocity-map imaging can be applied to the study of the inelastic scattering of OH using crossed-molecular-beam methods. We measure fully quantum-state-specified product angular distributions for OH collisions with helium and argon. The agreement between exact close-coupling quantum scattering calculations on ab initio potential energy surfaces and experimental data is generally very satisfactory, except for scattering in the most forward directions. Hydroxyl radicals (OH) are important in many chemical systems, including combustion and atmospheric reactions, however experimentally measuring their velocities in specific internal quantum states has proved difficult. Now differential cross-sections for inelastic scattering of fully state-specified OH with He and Ar have been observed for the first time using velocity-map imaging in a crossed-molecular-beam arrangement.

Self-assembling biomolecular catalysts for hydrogen production

The chemistry of highly evolved protein-based compartments has inspired the design of new catalytically active materials that self-assemble from biological components. A frontier of this biodesign is the potential to contribute new catalytic systems for the production of sustainable fuels, such as hydrogen. Here, we show the encapsulation and protection of an active hydrogen-producing and oxygen-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase, sequestered within the capsid of the bacteriophage P22 through directed self-assembly. We co-opted Escherichia coli for biomolecular synthesis and assembly of this nanomaterial by expressing and maturing the EcHyd-1 hydrogenase prior to expression of the P22 coat protein, which subsequently self assembles. By probing the infrared spectroscopic signatures and catalytic activity of the engineered material, we demonstrate that the capsid provides stability and protection to the hydrogenase cargo. These results illustrate how combining biological function with directed supramolecular self-assembly can be used to create new materials for sustainable catalysis. The encapsulation and stabilization of an oxygen tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase, sequestered within the bacteriophage P22 capsid, has now been achieved through a directed self-assembly process. Probing the catalytic activity and infrared spectroscopic signatures of the bio-inspired assembly shows that the capsid provides stability and protection to the hydrogenase cargo.

Title: 
MIDA boronates are hydrolysed fast and slow by two different mechanisms

MIDA boronates (N-methylimidodiacetic boronic acid esters) serve as an increasingly general platform for small-molecule construction based on building blocks, largely because of the dramatic and general rate differences with which they are hydrolysed under various basic conditions. Yet the mechanistic underpinnings of these rate differences have remained unclear, which has hindered efforts to address the current limitations of this chemistry. Here we show that there are two distinct mechanisms for this hydrolysis: one is base mediated and the other neutral. The former can proceed more than three orders of magnitude faster than the latter, and involves a rate-limiting attack by a hydroxide at a MIDA carbonyl carbon. The alternative ‘neutral’ hydrolysis does not require an exogenous acid or base and involves rate-limiting B–N bond cleavage by a small water cluster, (H2O)n. The two mechanisms can operate in parallel, and their relative rates are readily quantified by 18O incorporation. Whether hydrolysis is ‘fast’ or ‘slow’ is dictated by the pH, the water activity and the mass-transfer rates between phases. These findings stand to enable, in a rational way, an even more effective and widespread utilization of MIDA boronates in synthesis. The staged hydrolysis of N-methylimidodiacetic (MIDA) boronates is a prerequisite for their application in small-molecule constructions. Mechanistic studies now show that two distinct hydrolysis mechanisms operate in parallel, the partitioning — which is dependent on the pH, water activity and homogeneity of the medium — can be readily quantified by 18O incorporation.

Stable GaX2, InX2 and TlX2 radicals

The chemistry of the Group 13 metals is dominated by the +1 and +3 oxidation states, and simple monomeric M(II) species are typically short-lived, highly reactive species. Here we report the first thermally robust monomeric MX2 radicals of gallium, indium and thallium. By making use of sterically demanding boryl substituents, compounds of the type M(II)(boryl)2 (M&nbsp;=&nbsp;Ga, In, Tl) can be synthesized. These decompose above 130&nbsp;°C and are amenable to structural characterization in the solid state by X-ray crystallography. Electron paramagnetic resonance and computational studies reveal a dominant metal-centred character for all three radicals (&gt;70% spin density at the metal). M(II) species have been invoked as key short-lived intermediates in well-known electron-transfer processes; consistently, the chemical behaviour of these novel isolated species reveals facile one-electron shuttling processes at the metal centre. The chemistry of group 13 metals (M) is dominated by +1 and +3 oxidation states, so MX2 species are typically metal–metal-bonded dimers, M(II)2X4 or mixed-valence species M(I)M(III)X4. Now, monomeric M(II)(boryl)2 radicals have been prepared for gallium, indium and thallium. The compounds — structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography — are stable up to 130&nbsp;°C and exhibit dominant metal-centred radical character.

A dendritic single-molecule fluorescent probe that is monovalent, photostable and minimally blinking

Single-molecule fluorescence techniques have emerged as a powerful approach to understanding complex biological systems. However, a challenge researchers still face is the limited photostability of nearly all organic fluorophores, including the cyanine and Alexa dyes. We report a new, monovalent probe that emits in the far-red region of the visible spectrum with properties desirable for single-molecule optical imaging. This probe is based on a ring-fused boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core that is conjugated to a polyglycerol dendrimer (PGD). The dendrimer makes the hydrophobic fluorophore water-soluble. This probe exhibits excellent brightness, with an emission maximum of 705&nbsp;nm. We have observed strikingly long and stable emission from individual PGD–BODIPY probes, even in the absence of anti-fading agents such as Trolox, a combined oxidizing–reducing agent often used in single-molecule studies for improving the photostability of common imaging probes. These interesting properties greatly simplify use of the fluorophore. A far-red-fluorescent probe based on a ring-fused BODIPY core that is conjugated to a polyglycerol dendrimer is now reported. The most notable feature of this probe is its long-lasting fluorescence emission with a strikingly low level of blinking in single-molecule-imaging experiments, even in the absence of anti-fading agents such as Trolox.

Real-time observation of multiexcitonic states in ultrafast singlet fission using coherent 2D electronic spectroscopy

Singlet fission is the spin-allowed conversion of a spin-singlet exciton into a pair of spin-triplet excitons residing on neighbouring molecules. To rationalize this phenomenon, a multiexcitonic spin-zero triplet-pair state has been hypothesized as an intermediate in singlet fission. However, the nature of the intermediate states and the underlying mechanism of ultrafast fission have not been elucidated experimentally. Here, we study a series of pentacene derivatives using ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and unravel the origin of the states involved in fission. Our data reveal the crucial role of vibrational degrees of freedom coupled to electronic excitations that facilitate the mixing of multiexcitonic states with singlet excitons. The resulting manifold of vibronic states drives sub-100 fs fission with unity efficiency. Our results provide a framework for understanding singlet fission and show how the formation of vibronic manifolds with a high density of states facilitates fast and efficient electronic processes in molecular systems. Singlet fission, a spin-allowed conversion of a spin-singlet state into a pair of spin-triplet excitons, may be useful for the development of next-generation photovoltaics. Ultrafast coherence measurements now show that vibrational motions play a critical role in fission as they facilitate the mixing of triplet-pair states with singlet excitons.

Title: 
Molecular rectifier composed of DNA with high rectification ratio enabled by intercalation

The predictability, diversity and programmability of DNA make it a leading candidate for the design of functional electronic devices that use single molecules, yet its electron transport properties have not been fully elucidated. This is primarily because of a poor understanding of how the structure of DNA determines its electron transport. Here, we demonstrate a DNA-based molecular rectifier constructed by site-specific intercalation of small molecules (coralyne) into a custom-designed 11-base-pair DNA duplex. Measured current–voltage curves of the DNA–coralyne molecular junction show unexpectedly large rectification with a rectification ratio of about 15 at 1.1 V, a counter-intuitive finding considering the seemingly symmetrical molecular structure of the junction. A non-equilibrium Green's function-based model—parameterized by density functional theory calculations—revealed that the coralyne-induced spatial asymmetry in the electron state distribution caused the observed rectification. This inherent asymmetry leads to changes in the coupling of the molecular HOMO−1 level to the electrodes when an external voltage is applied, resulting in an asymmetric change in transmission. Understanding the correlation between structure and charge transport properties of a DNA-based single molecule device is crucial to the creation of nanoscale functional devices. Now, a DNA-based molecular rectifier with a high rectification ratio has been constructed by site-specific intercalation of small molecules (coralyne) into native double-stranded DNA.

Rapid heteroatom transfer to arylmetals utilizing multifunctional reagent scaffolds

Arylmetals are highly valuable carbon nucleophiles that are readily and inexpensively prepared from aryl halides or arenes and widely used on both laboratory and industrial scales to react directly with a wide range of electrophiles. Although C−C bond formation has been a staple of organic synthesis, the direct transfer of primary amino (−NH2) and hydroxyl (−OH) groups to arylmetals in a scalable and environmentally friendly fashion remains a formidable synthetic challenge because of the absence of suitable heteroatom-transfer reagents. Here, we demonstrate the use of bench-stable N−H and N−alkyl oxaziridines derived from readily available terpenoid scaffolds as efficient multifunctional reagents for the direct primary amination and hydroxylation of structurally diverse aryl- and heteroarylmetals. This practical and scalable method provides one-step synthetic access to primary anilines and phenols at low temperature and avoids the use of transition-metal catalysts, ligands and additives, nitrogen-protecting groups, excess reagents and harsh workup conditions. The direct transfer of primary amino and hydroxyl groups to arylmetals in a scalable and environmentally friendly fashion remains a formidable synthetic challenge. Here, it is demonstrated that bench-stable N–H and N–alkyl oxaziridines can be used as efficient multifunctional reagents, without deprotonation, for the direct primary amination and hydroxylation of (hetero)arylmetals.

Asymmetric triplex metallohelices with high and selective activity against cancer cells

Small cationic amphiphilic α-helical peptides are emerging as agents for the treatment of cancer and infection, but they are costly and display unfavourable pharmacokinetics. Helical coordination complexes may offer a three-dimensional scaffold for the synthesis of mimetic architectures. However, the high symmetry and modest functionality of current systems offer little scope to tailor the structure to interact with specific biomolecular targets, or to create libraries for phenotypic screens. Here, we report the highly stereoselective asymmetric self-assembly of very stable, functionalized metallohelices. Their anti-parallel head-to-head-to-tail ‘triplex’ strand arrangement creates an amphipathic functional topology akin to that of the active sub-units of, for example, host-defence peptides and p53. The metallohelices display high, structure-dependent toxicity to the human colon carcinoma cell-line HCT116 p53++, causing dramatic changes in the cell cycle without DNA damage. They have lower toxicity to human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-468) and, most remarkably, they show no significant toxicity to the bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Water-soluble metallohelices containing an antiparallel head-to-head-to-tail arrangement of strands are reported. This amphipathic functional topology is akin to that of host-defence peptides. The metallohelices show high and selective toxicity to a cancer cell line, causing dramatic changes in the cell cycle without DNA damage. In contrast, there is no significant toxicity to MRSA and Escherichia coli.

Fatty acid membrane assembly on coacervate microdroplets as a step towards a hybrid protocell model

Mechanisms of prebiotic compartmentalization are central to providing insights into how protocellular systems emerged on the early Earth. Protocell models are based predominantly on the membrane self-assembly of fatty-acid vesicles, although membrane-free scenarios that involve liquid–liquid microphase separation (coacervation) have also been considered. Here we integrate these alternative models of prebiotic compartmentalization and develop a hybrid protocell model based on the spontaneous self-assembly of a continuous fatty-acid membrane at the surface of preformed coacervate microdroplets prepared from cationic peptides/polyelectrolytes and adenosine triphosphate or oligo/polyribonucleotides. We show that the coacervate-supported membrane is multilamellar, and mediates the selective uptake or exclusion of small and large molecules. The coacervate interior can be disassembled without loss of membrane integrity, and fusion and growth of the hybrid protocells can be induced under conditions of high ionic strength. Our results highlight how notions of membrane-mediated compartmentalization, chemical enrichment and internalized structuration can be integrated in protocell models via simple chemical and physical processes. A hybrid protocell model is described in which a fatty acid membrane spontaneously assembles on the surface of coacervate microdroplets with molecularly crowded interiors. The membrane-enclosed protocells exhibit uptake and exclusion properties that differ from the uncoated droplets. The internal structure can be disassembled at high ionic strength without loss of membrane integrity. This model may help to reconcile alternative mechanisms of prebiotic compartmentalization.

Direct conversion of CO2 into liquid fuels with high selectivity over a bifunctional catalyst

Although considerable progress has been made in carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation to various C1 chemicals, it is still a great challenge to synthesize value-added products with two or more carbons, such as gasoline, directly from CO2 because of the extreme inertness of CO2 and a high C–C coupling barrier. Here we present a bifunctional catalyst composed of reducible indium oxides (In2O3) and zeolites that yields a high selectivity to gasoline-range hydrocarbons (78.6%) with a very low methane selectivity (1%). The oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 surfaces activate CO2 and hydrogen to form methanol, and C−C coupling subsequently occurs inside zeolite pores to produce gasoline-range hydrocarbons with a high octane number. The proximity of these two components plays a crucial role in suppressing the undesired reverse water gas shift reaction and giving a high selectivity for gasoline-range hydrocarbons. Moreover, the pellet catalyst exhibits a much better performance during an industry-relevant test, which suggests promising prospects for industrial applications. It is still a great challenge to synthesize value-added products with two or more carbons directly from CO2. Now, a bifunctional catalyst composed of reducible metal oxides (In2O3) and zeolites (HZSM-5) is prepared and yields high selectivity to gasoline-range hydrocarbons (78.6%) with a high octane number directly from CO2 hydrogenation.

Chelation and stabilization of berkelium in oxidation state +IV

Berkelium (Bk) has been predicted to be the only transplutonium element able to exhibit both +III and +IV oxidation states in solution, but evidence of a stable oxidized Bk chelate has so far remained elusive. Here we describe the stabilization of the heaviest 4+ ion of the periodic table, under mild aqueous conditions, using a siderophore derivative. The resulting Bk(IV) complex exhibits luminescence via sensitization through an intramolecular antenna effect. This neutral Bk(IV) coordination compound is not sequestered by the protein siderocalin—a mammalian metal transporter—in contrast to the negatively charged species obtained with neighbouring trivalent actinides americium, curium and californium (Cf). The corresponding Cf(III)–ligand–protein ternary adduct was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Combined with theoretical predictions, these data add significant insight to the field of transplutonium chemistry, and may lead to innovative Bk separation and purification processes. Berkelium is the only transplutonium element predicted to be able to exhibit both +III and +IV oxidation states in solution. Bk(IV) has now been stabilized through chelation with a siderophore derivative. The resulting neutral coordination compound was characterized and compared with the negatively charged species obtained by chelation of neighbouring trivalent actinides.

Product-state-resolved dynamics of the elementary reaction of atomic oxygen with molecular hydrogen, O(3P) + D2 → OD(X2Π) + D

Elementary three-atom systems provide stringent tests of the accuracy of ab initio theory. One such important reaction, O(3P)&nbsp;+&nbsp;H2&nbsp;→&nbsp;OH(X2Π)&nbsp;+&nbsp;H, has eluded detailed experimental study because of its high activation barrier. In this reaction, both the ground-state reactant atom and product diatomic molecule have open-shell character, which introduces the intriguing complication of non-Born–Oppenheimer effects in both the entrance and the exit channels. These effects may be probed experimentally in both the fine-structure and the Λ-doublet splittings of the OH product. We have used laser-induced fluorescence to measure OD internal product-state distributions from the analogous reaction of O(3P) with D2, enabled by a unique high-energy O(3P) source. We find that the OD (ν′&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) product is rotationally highly excited, in excellent agreement with earlier theoretical predictions. However, the distributions over the OD(X2Π) fine-structure and Λ-doublet states, diagnostic of electronic non-adiabaticity in the reaction, challenge the prevailing theoretical understanding. The reaction O(3P)&nbsp;+&nbsp;H2&nbsp;→&nbsp;OH(X2Π) +&nbsp;H has, until now, eluded detailed experimental investigation. Now, a laser-induced fluorescence study of the deuterated analogue has revealed product-state distributions that defy the current descriptions of non-Born–Oppenheimer mixing on coupled potential energy surfaces, issuing new challenges to theory.

Exploring the sequence space for (tri-)peptide self-assembly to design and discover new hydrogels

Peptides that self-assemble into nanostructures are of tremendous interest for biological, medical, photonic and nanotechnological applications. The enormous sequence space that is available from 20 amino acids probably harbours many interesting candidates, but it is currently not possible to predict supramolecular behaviour from sequence alone. Here, we demonstrate computational tools to screen for the aqueous self-assembly propensity in all of the 8,000 possible tripeptides and evaluate these by comparison with known examples. We applied filters to select for candidates that simultaneously optimize the apparently contradicting requirements of aggregation propensity and hydrophilicity, which resulted in a set of design rules for self-assembling sequences. A number of peptides were subsequently synthesized and characterized, including the first reported tripeptides that are able to form a hydrogel at neutral pH. These tools, which enable the peptide sequence space to be searched for supramolecular properties, enable minimalistic peptide nanotechnology to deliver on its promise. Peptides that self-assemble into nanostructures are of interest for many applications, including ones relevant to cosmetics, food, biomedicine and nanotechnology. Now, computational tools have been developed that enable peptide sequence space to be rapidly searched for supramolecular properties and this approach has been used to identify unprotected tripeptide hydrogelators.

Title: 
Molecular docking sites designed for the generation of highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) formed by connecting multidentate organic building blocks through covalent bonds provide a platform for designing multifunctional porous materials with atomic precision. As they are promising materials for applications in optoelectronics, they would benefit from a maximum degree of long-range order within the framework, which has remained a major challenge. We have developed a synthetic concept to allow consecutive COF sheets to lock in position during crystal growth, and thus minimize the occurrence of stacking faults and dislocations. Hereby, the three-dimensional conformation of propeller-shaped molecular building units was used to generate well-defined periodic docking sites, which guided the attachment of successive building blocks that, in turn, promoted long-range order during COF formation. This approach enables us to achieve a very high crystallinity for a series of COFs that comprise tri- and tetradentate central building blocks. We expect this strategy to be transferable to a broad range of customized COFs. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are attractive multifunctional porous materials that can be generated with atomic precision. However, endowing them with long-range order—desirable for applications—has remained challenging. Now, propeller-shaped building units have been used that allow consecutive layers to lock in position, resulting in highly crystalline COFs.

Title: 
Utilizing redox-chemistry to elucidate the nature of exciton transitions in supramolecular dye nanotubes

Supramolecular assemblies that interact with light have recently garnered much interest as well-defined nanoscale materials for electronic excitation energy collection and transport. However, to control such complex systems it is essential to understand how their various parts interact and whether these interactions result in coherently shared excited states (excitons) or in diffusive energy transport between them. Here, we address this by studying a model system consisting of two concentric cylindrical dye aggregates in a light-harvesting nanotube. Through selective chemistry we are able to unambiguously determine the supramolecular origin of the observed excitonic transitions. These results required the development of a new theoretical model of the supramolecular structure of the assembly. Our results demonstrate that the two cylinders of the nanotube have distinct spectral responses and are best described as two separate, weakly coupled excitonic systems. Understanding such interactions is critical to the control of energy transfer on a molecular scale, a goal in various applications ranging from artificial photosynthesis to molecular electronics. The collective excited states (excitons) in supramolecular light-harvesting systems depend intimately on their structure and it is crucial to understand how these states interact. Now it is shown that simple redox chemistry can be used to address this fundamental question by simplifying the complex excitonic interactions in such multichromophoric systems.

Metal-directed, chemically tunable assembly of one-, two- and three-dimensional crystalline protein arrays

Proteins represent the most sophisticated building blocks available to an organism and to the laboratory chemist. Yet, in contrast to nearly all other types of molecular building blocks, the designed self-assembly of proteins has largely been inaccessible because of the chemical and structural heterogeneity of protein surfaces. To circumvent the challenge of programming extensive non-covalent interactions to control protein self-assembly, we have previously exploited the directionality and strength of metal coordination interactions to guide the formation of closed, homoligomeric protein assemblies. Here, we extend this strategy to the generation of periodic protein arrays. We show that a monomeric protein with properly oriented coordination motifs on its surface can arrange, on metal binding, into one-dimensional nanotubes and two- or three-dimensional crystalline arrays with dimensions that collectively span nearly the entire nano- and micrometre scale. The assembly of these arrays is tuned predictably by external stimuli, such as metal concentration and pH. The self-assembly of proteins into ordered yet dynamic nanoscale architectures is a crucial biological process and an inspiration for supramolecular chemistry, but has remained largely inaccessible synthetically. A monomeric protein has now been prepared that assembles with zinc ions into one-, two- and three-dimensional crystalline arrays with nano- and microscale order.

Title: 
Cyclic polymers from alkynes

Cyclic polymers have dramatically different physical properties compared with those of their equivalent linear counterparts. However, the exploration of cyclic polymers is limited because of the inherent challenges associated with their synthesis. Conjugated linear polyacetylenes are important materials for electrical conductivity, paramagnetic susceptibility, optical nonlinearity, photoconductivity, gas permeability, liquid crystallinity and chain helicity. However, their cyclic analogues are unknown, and therefore the ability to examine how a cyclic topology influences their properties is currently not possible. We have solved this challenge and now report a tungsten catalyst supported by a tetraanionic pincer ligand that can rapidly polymerize alkynes to form conjugated macrocycles in high yield. The catalyst works by tethering the ends of the polymer to the metal centre to overcome the inherent entropic penalty of cyclization. Gel-permeation chromatography, dynamic and static light scattering, viscometry and chemical tests are all consistent with theoretical predictions and provide unambiguous confirmation of a cyclic topology. Access to a wide variety of new cyclic polymers is now possible by simply choosing the appropriate alkyne monomer. Cyclic polymers are an area of significant interest, but understanding the potential of these macrocycles has been difficult because of challenges in their synthesis and characterization. It has now been shown that a tungsten catalyst featuring a tetraanionic pincer ligand can rapidly polymerize alkynes to form conjugated macrocycles in high yield.

Title: 
Enzymatic hydroxylation of an unactivated methylene C–H bond guided by molecular dynamics simulations

The hallmark of enzymes from secondary metabolic pathways is the pairing of powerful reactivity with exquisite site selectivity. The application of these biocatalytic tools in organic synthesis, however, remains under-utilized due to limitations in substrate scope and scalability. Here, we report how the reactivity of a monooxygenase (PikC) from the pikromycin pathway is modified through computationally guided protein and substrate engineering, and applied to the oxidation of unactivated methylene C–H bonds. Molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical calculations were used to develop a predictive model for substrate scope, site selectivity and stereoselectivity of PikC-mediated C–H oxidation. A suite of menthol derivatives was screened computationally and evaluated through in vitro reactions, where each substrate adhered to the predicted models for selectivity and conversion to product. This platform was also expanded beyond menthol-based substrates to the selective hydroxylation of a variety of substrate cores ranging from cyclic to fused bicyclic and bridged bicyclic compounds. The reactivity of a monooxygenase (P450 PikC) has been modified through protein and substrate engineering, and applied to the oxidation of unactivated methylene C–H bonds. The protein engineering was guided by using molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical calculations to develop a predictive model for substrate scope, site selectivity and stereoselectivity of the C–H hydroxylation.

Title: 
Catalytic transformation of alcohols to carboxylic acid salts and H2 using water as the oxygen atom source

The oxidation of alcohols to carboxylic acids is an important industrial reaction used in the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals. Most current processes are performed by making use of either stoichiometric amounts of toxic oxidizing agents or the use of pressurized dioxygen. Here, we describe an alternative dehydrogenative pathway effected by water and base with the concomitant generation of hydrogen gas. A homogeneous ruthenium complex catalyses the transformation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acid salts at low catalyst loadings (0.2&nbsp;mol%) in basic aqueous solution. A consequence of this finding could be a safer and cleaner process for the synthesis of carboxylic acids and their derivatives at both laboratory and industrial scales. The development of a catalytic, mild and atom-economical transformation of alcohols to carboxylic acid salts and hydrogen gas is described. The reaction uses water as a source of oxygen, with a homogenous Ru catalyst at low (0.2&nbsp;mol%) catalyst loadings in basic aqueous solution.

Title: 
Terpene cyclization catalysed inside a self-assembled cavity

In nature, complex terpene natural products are formed by the so-called tail-to-head terpene (THT) cyclization. The cationic reaction cascade is promoted efficiently in complex enzyme pockets, in which cationic intermediates and transition states are stabilized. In solution, the reaction is hard to control and man-made catalysts able to perform selective THT cyclizations are lacking. We herein report the first example of a successful THT cyclization inside a supramolecular structure. The basic mode of operation in cyclase enzymes was mimicked successfully and a catalytic non-stop THT was achieved with geranyl acetate as the substrate. The results presented have implications for the postulated reaction mechanism in cyclase enzymes. Evidence indicates that the direct isomerization of a geranyl cation to the cisoid isomer, which so far was considered unlikely, is feasible. A tail-to-head terpene cyclization, which is hard to control in solution, has now been catalysed inside a supramolecular structure. Evidence indicates that a direct isomerization of a geranyl cation to the cisoid-isomer, which so far was considered unlikely in the biosynthesis, is feasible in this system.

Title: 
Use of the interior cavity of the P22 capsid for site-specific initiation of atom-transfer radical polymerization with high-density cargo loading

Virus-like particles (VLPs) have emerged as important and versatile architectures for chemical manipulation in the development of functional hybrid nanostructures. Here we demonstrate a successful site-selective initiation of atom-transfer radical polymerization reactions to form an addressable polymer constrained within the interior cavity of a VLP. Potentially, this protein–polymer hybrid of P22 and cross-linked poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) could be useful as a new high-density delivery vehicle for the encapsulation and delivery of small-molecule cargos. In particular, the encapsulated polymer can act as a scaffold for the attachment of small functional molecules, such as fluorescein dye or the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent Gd-diethylenetriaminepentacetate, through reactions with its pendant primary amine groups. Using this approach, a significant increase in the labelling density of the VLP, compared to that of previous modifications of VLPs, can be achieved. These results highlight the use of multimeric protein–polymer conjugates for their potential utility in the development of VLP-based MRI contrast agents with the possibility of loading other cargos. The site-selective initiation and propagation of an atom-transfer radical polymerization reaction forms an addressable crosslinked polymer constrained within the interior cavity of a virus-like particle derived from the bacteriophage P22. This protein–polymer hybrid is useful as a new vehicle for high-density delivery of small-molecule cargos.

Title: 
Adsorbate-mediated strong metal–support interactions in oxide-supported Rh catalysts

The optimization of supported metal catalysts predominantly focuses on engineering the metal site, for which physical insights based on extensive theoretical and experimental contributions have enabled the rational design of active sites. Although it is well known that supports can influence the catalytic properties of metals, insights into how metal–support interactions can be exploited to optimize metal active-site properties are lacking. Here we utilize in situ spectroscopy and microscopy to identify and characterize a support effect in oxide-supported heterogeneous Rh catalysts. This effect is characterized by strongly bound adsorbates (HCOx) on reducible oxide supports (TiO2 and Nb2O5) that induce oxygen-vacancy formation in the support and cause HCOx-functionalized encapsulation of Rh nanoparticles by the support. The encapsulation layer is permeable to reactants, stable under the reaction conditions and strongly influences the catalytic properties of Rh, which enables rational and dynamic tuning of CO2-reduction selectivity. Developing approaches to tune the reactivity and selectivity of supported-metal heterogeneous catalysts is critical for designing environmentally friendly chemical conversion processes. A reversible structural catalyst transformation has now been identified that involves the adsorbate-mediated encapsulation of Rh nanoparticles by their oxide support and enables dynamic tuning of the selectivity of CO2 reduction.

Title: 
Large negative thermal expansion of a polymer driven by a submolecular conformational change

Mechanoresponsive polymers hold great technological potential in drug delivery, ‘smart’ optical systems and microelectromechanical systems. However, hysteresis and fatigue (associated with large-scale polymer chain rearrangement) are often problematic. Here, we describe a polyarylamide film that contains s-dibenzocyclooctadiene (DBCOD), which can generate unconventional and completely reversible thermal contraction under low-energy stimulation. The films exhibit a giant negative thermal expansion coefficient of approximately −1,200&nbsp;ppm&nbsp;K−1 at ambient or near-ambient temperatures, much higher than any known negative-thermal-expansion materials under similar operating conditions. Mechanical characterization, calorimetry, spectroscopic analysis and density-functional theory calculations all point to the conformational change of the DBCOD moiety,&nbsp;from the thermodynamic global energy minimum (twist-boat) to a local minimum (chair), as the origin of this abnormal thermal shrinkage. This newly identified, low-energy-driven, thermally agile molecular subunit opens a new pathway to creating near-infrared-based macromolecular switches and motors, and for ambient thermal energy storage and conversion. Polymers that exhibit a mechanical response to external stimuli are technologically important. Here, a polymer is described that shows a very large negative thermal expansion on heating or irradiation with near-infrared light. This property is stable over hundreds of cycles and is shown to be driven by a conformational change of an s-dibenzocyclooctadiene unit within the polymer structure.

Title: 
Remodelling of the natural product fumagillol employing a reaction discovery approach

In the search for new biologically active molecules, diversity-oriented synthetic strategies break through the limitation of traditional library synthesis by sampling new chemical space. Many natural products can be regarded as intriguing starting points for diversity-oriented synthesis, wherein stereochemically rich core structures may be reorganized into chemotypes that are distinctly different from the parent structure. Ideally, to be suited to library applications, such transformations should be general and involve few steps. With this objective in mind, the highly oxygenated natural product fumagillol has been successfully remodelled in several ways using a reaction-discovery-based approach. In reactions with amines, excellent regiocontrol in a bis-epoxide opening/cyclization sequence can be obtained by size-dependent interaction of an appropriate catalyst with the parent molecule, forming either perhydroisoindole or perhydroisoquinoline products. Perhydroisoindoles can be further remodelled by cascade processes to afford either morpholinone or bridged 4,1-benzoxazepine-containing structures. The natural product fumagillol has been exploited as a stereochemically rich scaffold for the synthesis of a structurally unique, chemically diverse library with chemotypes distinctly different from the parent structure. Thus, fumagillol has been remodelled into a diverse array of isoindoles, isoquinolines, furans, mopholinones and benzoxazepines.

Title: 
High-resolution mapping of bifurcations in nonlinear biochemical circuits

Analog molecular circuits can exploit the nonlinear nature of biochemical reaction networks to compute low-precision outputs with fewer resources than digital circuits. This analog computation is similar to that employed by gene-regulation networks. Although digital systems have a tractable link between structure and function, the nonlinear and continuous nature of analog circuits yields an intricate functional landscape, which makes their design counter-intuitive, their characterization laborious and their analysis delicate. Here, using droplet-based microfluidics, we map with high resolution and dimensionality the bifurcation diagrams of two synthetic, out-of-equilibrium and nonlinear programs: a bistable DNA switch and a predator–prey DNA oscillator. The diagrams delineate where function is optimal, dynamics bifurcates and models fail. Inverse problem solving on these large-scale data sets indicates interference from enzymatic coupling. Additionally, data mining exposes the presence of rare, stochastically bursting oscillators near deterministic bifurcations. Dynamic nonlinear biochemical circuits are functionally rich; however, this nonlinear nature also makes programming them delicate and painstaking. Now a droplet microfluidic platform reveals precisely the bifurcations of two canonical systems: a bistable switch and a predator–prey oscillator, exposing optimal regions and mechanistic insights that inform the design of these systems.

Validation of N-myristoyltransferase as an antimalarial drug target using an integrated chemical biology approach

Malaria is an infectious disease caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which leads to approximately one million deaths per annum worldwide. Chemical validation of new antimalarial targets is urgently required in view of rising resistance to current drugs. One such putative target is the enzyme N-myristoyltransferase, which catalyses the attachment of the fatty acid myristate to protein substrates (N-myristoylation). Here, we report an integrated chemical biology approach to explore protein myristoylation in the major human parasite P. falciparum, combining chemical proteomic tools for identification of the myristoylated and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteome with selective small-molecule N-myristoyltransferase inhibitors. We demonstrate that N-myristoyltransferase is an essential and chemically tractable target in malaria parasites both in vitro and in vivo, and show that selective inhibition of N-myristoylation leads to catastrophic and irreversible failure to assemble the inner membrane complex, a critical subcellular organelle in the parasite life cycle. Our studies provide the basis for the development of new antimalarials targeting N-myristoyltransferase. Chemical validation of new drug targets is urgently required to help develop new antimalarial therapies. Here, chemical proteomic tools and selective enzyme inhibitors are combined to study protein lipidation in human malaria parasites, leading to in vitro and in vivo validation of the enzyme N-myristoyltransferase as a drug target.

Title: 
The mechanism of proton conduction in phosphoric acid

Neat liquid phosphoric acid (H3PO4) has the highest intrinsic proton conductivity of any known substance and is a useful model for understanding proton transport in other phosphate-based systems in biology and clean energy technologies. Here, we present an ab initio molecular dynamics study that reveals, for the first time, the microscopic mechanism of this high proton conductivity. Anomalously fast proton transport in hydrogen-bonded systems involves a structural diffusion mechanism in which intramolecular proton transfer is driven by specific hydrogen bond rearrangements in the surrounding environment. Aqueous media transport excess charge defects through local hydrogen bond rearrangements that drive individual proton transfer reactions. In contrast, strong, polarizable hydrogen bonds in phosphoric acid produce coupled proton motion and a pronounced protic dielectric response of the medium, leading to the formation of extended, polarized hydrogen-bonded chains. The interplay between these chains and a frustrated hydrogen-bond network gives rise to the high proton conductivity. Proton transport in phosphate-based systems is important in biology and clean energy technologies, and phosphoric acid, being the best known intrinsic proton conductor, represents an important model. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations now reveal that the interplay between extended, polarized, hydrogen-bonded chains and a frustrated hydrogen-bond network gives rise to the high conductivity in liquid phosphoric acid.

Title: 
Prebiotic selection and assembly of proteinogenic amino acids and natural nucleotides from complex mixtures

A central problem for the prebiotic synthesis of biological amino acids and nucleotides is to avoid the concomitant synthesis of undesired or irrelevant by-products. Additionally, multistep pathways require mechanisms that enable the sequential addition of reactants and purification of intermediates that are consistent with reasonable geochemical scenarios. Here, we show that 2-aminothiazole reacts selectively with two- and three-carbon sugars (glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde, respectively), which results in their accumulation and purification as stable crystalline aminals. This permits ribonucleotide synthesis, even from complex sugar mixtures. Remarkably, aminal formation also overcomes the thermodynamically favoured isomerization of glyceraldehyde into dihydroxyacetone because only the aminal of glyceraldehyde separates from the equilibrating mixture. Finally, we show that aminal formation provides a novel pathway to amino acids that avoids the synthesis of the non-proteinogenic α,α-disubstituted analogues. The common physicochemical mechanism that controls the proteinogenic amino acid and ribonucleotide assembly from prebiotic mixtures suggests that these essential classes of metabolite had a unified chemical origin. 2-aminothiazole — a hybrid of prebiotic amino acid and nucleotide precursors — sequentially accumulates and purifies glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde from complex mixtures in the order required for ribonucleotide synthesis, dynamically resolves glyceraldehyde from its ketose-isomer dihydroxyacetone, and provides the first strategy to select natural amino acids from abiotic aldehydes and ketones.

Unexpected mechanochemical complexity in the mechanistic scenarios of disulfide bond reduction in alkaline solution

The reduction of disulfides has a broad importance in chemistry, biochemistry and materials science, particularly those methods that use mechanochemical activation. Here we show, using isotensional simulations, that strikingly different mechanisms govern disulfide cleavage depending on the external force. Desolvation and resolvation processes are found to be crucial, as they have a direct impact on activation free energies. The preferred pathway at moderate forces, a bimolecular SN2 attack of OH– at sulfur, competes with unimolecular C–S bond rupture at about 2 nN, and the latter even becomes barrierless at greater applied forces. Moreover, our study unveils a surprisingly rich reactivity scenario that also includes the transformation of concerted SN2 reactions into pure bond-breaking processes at specific forces. Given that these forces are easily reached in experiments, these insights will fundamentally change our understanding of mechanochemical activation in general, which is now expected to be considerably more intricate than previously thought. The controlled mechanical activation of specific covalent bonds is a rapidly expanding field in chemistry. Now, it is shown that disulfide bond reduction proceeds through different mechanisms depending on the external force applied. This strongly suggests that refined models should be used when interpreting mechanochemical experiments, particularly when sonication is involved.

Title: 
Iterative exponential growth of stereo- and sequence-controlled polymers

Chemists have long sought sequence-controlled synthetic polymers that mimic nature's biopolymers, but a practical synthetic route that enables absolute control over polymer sequence and structure remains a key challenge. Here, we report an iterative exponential growth plus side-chain functionalization (IEG+) strategy that begins with enantiopure epoxides and facilitates the efficient synthesis of a family of uniform &gt;3 kDa macromolecules of varying sequence and stereoconfiguration that are coupled to produce unimolecular polymers (&gt;6 kDa) with sequences and structures that cannot be obtained using traditional polymerization techniques. Selective side-chain deprotection of three hexadecamers is also demonstrated, which imbues each compound with the ability to dissolve in water. We anticipate that these new macromolecules and the general IEG+ strategy will find broad application as a versatile platform for the scalable synthesis of sequence-controlled polymers. Regioselective epoxide opening of an enantiopure epoxy–alkyne results in the stereospecific introduction of functional side-chains into growing macromolecules. This process—in combination with 'click' chemistry and orthogonal deprotection of terminal alkynes—underpins an iterative exponential growth methodology that enables the efficient synthesis of &gt;6-kDa stereo- and sequence-controlled polymers.

Enantioselective construction of quaternary N-heterocycles by palladium-catalysed decarboxylative allylic alkylation of lactams

The enantioselective synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles (N-heterocycles) represents a substantial chemical research effort and resonates across numerous disciplines, including the total synthesis of natural products and medicinal chemistry. In this Article, we describe the highly enantioselective palladium-catalysed decarboxylative allylic alkylation of readily available lactams to form 3,3-disubstituted pyrrolidinones, piperidinones, caprolactams and structurally related lactams. Given the prevalence of quaternary N-heterocycles in biologically active alkaloids and pharmaceutical agents, we envisage that our method will provide a synthetic entry into the de novo asymmetric synthesis of such structures. As an entry for these investigations we demonstrate how the described catalysis affords enantiopure quaternary lactams that intercept synthetic intermediates previously used in the synthesis of the Aspidosperma alkaloids quebrachamine and rhazinilam, but that were previously only available by chiral auxiliary approaches or as racemic mixtures. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles are ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals and in materials science. Here, the stereoselective synthesis of a wide array of structurally diverse, functionalized lactams by palladium-catalysed enantioselective enolate alkylation is described.

Catalytic diversity in self-propagating peptide assemblies

The protein-only infectious agents known as prions exist within cellular matrices as populations of assembled polypeptide phases ranging from particles to amyloid fibres. These phases appear to undergo Darwinian-like selection and propagation, yet remarkably little is known about their accessible chemical and biological functions. Here we construct simple peptides that assemble into well-defined amyloid phases and define paracrystalline surfaces able to catalyse specific enantioselective chemical reactions. Structural adjustments of individual amino acid residues predictably control both the assembled crystalline order and their accessible catalytic repertoire. Notably, the density and proximity of the extended arrays of enantioselective catalytic sites achieve template-directed polymerization of new polymers. These diverse amyloid templates can now be extended as dynamic self-propagating templates for the construction of even more complex functional materials. Simple peptides are shown to assemble into well-defined amyloid phases with paracrystalline surfaces that can catalyse reactions in an enantioselective manner. Modifying individual amino acids in the building blocks enables the structure of the assembled aggregates, and the reactions that they can catalyse, to be controlled predictably.

Title: 
Recognition and sensing of low-epitope targets via ternary complexes with oligonucleotides and synthetic receptors

Oligonucleotide-based receptors or aptamers can interact with small molecules, but the ability to achieve high-affinity and specificity of these interactions depends strongly on functional groups or epitopes displayed by the binding targets. Some classes of targets are particularly challenging: for example, monosaccharides have scarce functionalities and no aptamers have been reported to recognize, let alone distinguish from each other, glucose and other hexoses. Here we report aptamers that differentiate low-epitope targets such as glucose, fructose or galactose by forming ternary complexes with high-epitope organic receptors for monosaccharides. In a follow-up example, we expand this method to isolate high-affinity oligonucleotides against aromatic amino acids complexed in situ with a nonspecific organometallic receptor. The method is general and enables broad clinical use of aptamers for the detection of small molecules in mix-and-measure assays, as demonstrated by monitoring postprandial waves of phenylalanine in human subjects. Recognition, differentiation and sensing of small molecules displaying only sparse functionalities using artificial receptors is extremely challenging. Now a method to selectively bind and recognise low-epitope targets has been developed. The approach uses the formation of ternary complexes between small-molecule targets, their non-specific organic (or organometallic) receptors, and aptamers.

Title: 
Small-molecule control of protein function through Staudinger reduction

Using small molecules to control the function of proteins in live cells with complete specificity is highly desirable, but challenging. Here we report a small-molecule switch that can be used to control protein activity. The approach uses a phosphine-mediated Staudinger reduction to activate protein function. Genetic encoding of an ortho-azidobenzyloxycarbonyl amino acid using a pyrrolysyl transfer RNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair in mammalian cells enables the site-specific introduction of a small-molecule-removable protecting group into the protein of interest. Strategic placement of this group renders the protein inactive until deprotection through a bioorthogonal Staudinger reduction delivers the active wild-type protein. This developed methodology was applied to the conditional control of several cellular processes, including bioluminescence (luciferase), fluorescence (enhanced green fluorescent protein), protein translocation (nuclear localization sequence), DNA recombination (Cre) and gene editing (Cas9). A generally applicable small-molecule switch for protein function in live cells has been developed based on selective protein protection using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis and a bioorthogonal deprotection via Staudinger reduction.

Stabilization of elusive silicon oxides

Molecular SiO2 and other simple silicon oxides have remained elusive despite the indispensable use of silicon dioxide materials in advanced electronic devices. Owing to the great reactivity of silicon–oxygen double bonds, as well as the low oxidation state of silicon atoms, the chemistry of simple silicon oxides is essentially unknown. We now report that the soluble disilicon compound, L:Si=Si:L (where L: = :C{N(2,6-iPr2C6H3)CH}2), can be directly oxidized by N2O and O2 to give the carbene-stabilized Si2O3 and Si2O4 moieties, respectively. The nature of the silicon oxide units in these compounds is probed by spectroscopic methods, complementary computations and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Molecular SiO2 and other simple silicon oxides have remained elusive despite the importance of silicon dioxide materials in advanced electronic devices. Clusters Si2O3 and Si2O4 have now been experimentally realized by direct oxidation of a carbene-stabilized disilicon using N2O and O2, respectively.

Title: 
Constructing monocrystalline covalent organic networks by polymerization

An emerging strategy for making ordered materials is modular construction, which connects preformed molecular subunits to neighbours through interactions of properly selected reactive sites. This strategy has yielded remarkable materials, including metal–organic frameworks joined by coordinative bonds, supramolecular networks linked by strong non-covalent interactions, and covalent organic frameworks in which atoms of carbon and other light elements are bonded covalently. However, the strategy has not yet produced covalently bonded organic materials in the form of large single crystals. Here we show that such materials can result from reversible self-addition polymerizations of suitably designed monomers. In particular, monomers with four tetrahedrally oriented nitroso groups polymerize to form diamondoid azodioxy networks that can be fully characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. This work forges a strong new link between polymer science and supramolecular chemistry by showing how predictably ordered covalent or non-covalent structures can both be built using a single modular strategy. Modular construction using connectable molecular subunits is a powerful strategy for making new carbon-based materials. So far, large crystals have been produced only from subunits linked by weak interactions. Covalently bonded analogues have now been prepared by reversible self-addition polymerization of suitable monomers and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

Monitoring one-electron photo-oxidation of guanine in DNA crystals using ultrafast infrared spectroscopy

To understand the molecular origins of diseases caused by ultraviolet and visible light, and also to develop photodynamic therapy, it is important to resolve the mechanism of photoinduced DNA damage. Damage to DNA bound to a photosensitizer molecule frequently proceeds by one-electron photo-oxidation of guanine, but the precise dynamics of this process are sensitive to the location and the orientation of the photosensitizer, which are very difficult to define in solution. To overcome this, ultrafast time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy was performed on photoexcited ruthenium polypyridyl–DNA crystals, the atomic structure of which was determined by X-ray crystallography. By combining the X-ray and TRIR data we are able to define both the geometry of the reaction site and the rates of individual steps in a reversible photoinduced electron-transfer process. This allows us to propose an individual guanine as the reaction site and, intriguingly, reveals that the dynamics in the crystal state are quite similar to those observed in the solvent medium. Uncertainty associated with solution-based electron-transfer studies of DNA–metal-complex systems has now been overcome by combining X-ray and time-resolved infrared data obtained for ruthenium polypyridyl–DNA crystals. Using these methods both the geometry of the reaction site and the kinetics of the reversible photo-induced one-electron oxidation of guanine have been determined.

Competition of shape and interaction patchiness for self-assembling nanoplates

Progress in nanocrystal synthesis and self-assembly enables the formation of highly ordered superlattices. Recent studies focused on spherical particles with tunable attraction and polyhedral particles with anisotropic shape, and excluded volume repulsion, but the effects of shape on particle interaction are only starting to be exploited. Here we present a joint experimental–computational multiscale investigation of a class of highly faceted planar lanthanide fluoride nanocrystals (nanoplates, nanoplatelets). The nanoplates self-assemble into long-range ordered tilings at the liquid–air interface formed by a hexane wetting layer. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that their assembly can be understood from maximization of packing density only in a first approximation. Explaining the full phase behaviour requires an understanding of nanoplate-edge interactions, which originate from the atomic structure, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Despite the apparent simplicity in particle geometry, the combination of shape-induced entropic and edge-specific energetic effects directs the formation and stabilization of unconventional long-range ordered assemblies not attainable otherwise. Thin lanthanide fluoride nanoplates are shown to self-organize at the liquid/air interface into long-range-ordered two-dimensional planar tilings. In this joint experimental–computational, multiscale investigation, the assembly behaviour is shown to be dictated by entropic forces arising from particle shape and enthalpic forces arising from interaction anisotropy.

Influence of the leaving group on the dynamics of a gas-phase SN2 reaction

In addition to the nucleophile and solvent, the leaving group has a significant influence on SN2 nucleophilic substitution reactions. Its role is frequently discussed with respect to reactivity, but its influence on the reaction dynamics remains unclear. Here, we uncover the influence of the leaving group on the gas-phase dynamics of SN2 reactions in a combined approach of crossed-beam imaging and dynamics simulations. We have studied the reaction F− + CH3Cl and compared it to F− + CH3I. For the two leaving groups, Cl and I, we find very similar structures and energetics, but the dynamics show qualitatively different features. Simple scaling of the leaving group mass does not explain these differences. Instead, the relevant impact parameters for the reaction mechanisms are found to be crucial and the differences are attributed to the relative orientation of the approaching reactants. This effect occurs on short timescales and may also prevail in solution-phase conditions. Little is known about how the identity of a leaving group affects the dynamics of a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction. A study of the reaction of F− with CH3Cl, and comparison to its reaction with CH3I, now reveals key insights into such effects, with reactant orientation considered a key factor in understanding the behaviour observed.

Chromophore twisting in the excited state of a photoswitchable fluorescent protein captured by time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography

Chromophores absorb light in photosensitive proteins and thereby initiate fundamental biological processes such as photosynthesis, vision and biofluorescence. An important goal in their understanding is the provision of detailed structural descriptions of the ultrafast photochemical events that they undergo, in particular of the excited states that connect chemistry to biological function. Here we report on the structures of two excited states in the reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2. We populated the states through femtosecond illumination of rsEGFP2 in its non-fluorescent off state and observed their build-up (within less than one picosecond) and decay (on the several picosecond timescale). Using an X-ray free-electron laser, we performed picosecond time-resolved crystallography and show that the hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone chromophore in one of the excited states assumes a near-canonical twisted configuration halfway between the trans and cis isomers. This is in line with excited-state quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our new understanding of the structure around the twisted chromophore enabled the design of a mutant that displays a twofold increase in its off-to-on photoswitching quantum yield. Providing detailed structural descriptions of the ultrafast photochemical events that occur in light-sensitive proteins is key to their understanding. Now, excited-state structures in the reversibly switchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2 have been solved by time-resolved crystallography using an X-ray laser. These structures enabled the design of a mutant with improved photoswitching quantum yields.

Gallium-rich Pd–Ga phases as supported liquid metal catalysts

A strategy to develop improved catalysts is to create systems that merge the advantages of heterogeneous and molecular catalysis. One such system involves supported liquid-phase catalysts, which feature a molecularly defined, catalytically active liquid film/droplet layer adsorbed on a porous solid support. In the past decade, this concept has also been extended to supported ionic liquid-phase catalysts. Here we develop this idea further and describe supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS). We report a liquid mixture of gallium and palladium deposited on porous glass that forms an active catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation that is resistant to coke formation and is thus highly stable. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, supported by theoretical calculations, confirm the liquid state of the catalytic phase under the reaction conditions. Unlike traditional heterogeneous catalysts, the supported liquid metal reported here is highly dynamic and catalysis does not proceed at the surface of the metal nanoparticles, but presumably at homogeneously distributed metal atoms at the surface of a liquid metallic phase. Creating systems that merge some of the advantages of both heterogeneous and molecular catalysis is a useful approach to developing improved catalysts. Following this strategy, a liquid mixture of gallium and palladium supported on porous glass has now been shown to form an active catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation that is resistant to coke formation and is thus highly stable.

Surfactant-free single-layer graphene in water

Dispersing graphite in water to obtain true (single-layer) graphene in bulk quantity in a liquid has been an unreachable goal for materials scientists in the past decade. Similarly, a diagnostic tool to identify solubilized graphene in situ has been long awaited. Here we show that homogeneous stable dispersions of single-layer graphene (SLG) in water can be obtained by mixing graphenide (negatively charged graphene) solutions in tetrahydrofuran with degassed water and evaporating the organic solvent. In situ Raman spectroscopy of these aqueous dispersions shows all the expected characteristics of SLG. Transmission electron and atomic force microscopies on deposits confirm the single-layer character. The resulting additive-free stable water dispersions contain 400 m2 l–1 of developed graphene surface. Films prepared from these dispersions exhibit a conductivity of up to 32 kS m–1. Aggregation usually prevents dissolution of graphene in water. Now, hydroxide ion adsorption has been shown to allow the stabilization of true single-layer graphene in water — with no surfactant required — so long as the liquid is degassed beforehand. The resulting aqueous dispersions can contain high concentrations of exfoliated graphene that are stable for several months.

Stabilization of anti-aromatic and strained five-membered rings with a transition metal

Anti-aromatic compounds, as well as small cyclic alkynes or carbynes, are particularly challenging synthetic goals. The combination of their destabilizing features hinders attempts to prepare molecules such as pentalyne, an 8π-electron anti-aromatic bicycle with extremely high ring strain. Here we describe the facile synthesis of osmapentalyne derivatives that are thermally viable, despite containing the smallest angles observed so far at a carbyne carbon. The compounds are characterized using X-ray crystallography, and their computed energies and magnetic properties reveal aromatic character. Hence, the incorporation of the osmium centre not only reduces the ring strain of the parent pentalyne, but also converts its Hückel anti-aromaticity into Craig-type Möbius aromaticity in the metallapentalynes. The concept of aromaticity is thus extended to five-membered rings containing a metal–carbon triple bond. Moreover, these metal–aromatic compounds exhibit unusual optical effects such as near-infrared photoluminescence with particularly large Stokes shifts, long lifetimes and aggregation enhancement. Pentalyne — a bicyclic anti-aromatic molecule that contains a strained five-membered ring — is a challenging synthetic target. Incorporation of an osmium centre has been shown to stabilize such features and enable the preparation of two osmapentalyne derivatives. Despite featuring the smallest angles observed so far at a carbyne moiety, these molecules benefit from Möbius aromaticity and reduced ring strain.

Diversity in the dynamical behaviour of a compartmentalized programmable biochemical oscillator

In vitro compartmentalization of biochemical reaction networks is a crucial step towards engineering artificial cell-scale devices and systems. At this scale the dynamics of molecular systems becomes stochastic, which introduces several engineering challenges and opportunities. Here we study a programmable transcriptional oscillator system that is compartmentalized into microemulsion droplets with volumes between 33 fl and 16 pl. Simultaneous measurement of large populations of droplets reveals major variations in the amplitude, frequency and damping of the oscillations. Variability increases for smaller droplets and depends on the operating point of the oscillator. Rather than reflecting the stochastic kinetics of the chemical reaction network itself, the variability can be attributed to the statistical variation of reactant concentrations created during their partitioning into droplets. We anticipate that robustness to partitioning variability will be a critical challenge for engineering cell-scale systems, and that highly parallel time-series acquisition from microemulsion droplets will become a key tool for characterization of stochastic circuit function. Compartmentalization of complex chemical networks is an essential step towards the creation of cell-scale molecular systems. The encapsulation of a synthetic biochemical oscillating reaction system into cell-sized emulsion droplets is now demonstrated; a large variability in its oscillatory dynamics is observed, which is attributed to partitioning effects.

Enantiospecific sp2–sp3 coupling of secondary and tertiary boronic esters

The cross-coupling of boronic acids and related derivatives with sp2 electrophiles (the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction) is one of the most powerful C–C bond formation reactions in synthesis, with applications that span pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and high-tech materials. Despite the breadth of its utility, the scope of this Nobel prize-winning reaction is rather limited when applied to aliphatic boronic esters. Primary organoboron reagents work well, but secondary and tertiary boronic esters do not (apart from a few specific and isolated examples). Through an alternative strategy, which does not involve using transition metals, we have discovered that enantioenriched secondary and tertiary boronic esters can be coupled to electron-rich aromatics with essentially complete enantiospecificity. As the enantioenriched boronic esters are easily accessible, this reaction should find considerable application, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where there is growing awareness of the importance of, and greater clinical success in, creating biomolecules with three-dimensional architectures. A general and broad-ranging stereospecific coupling of secondary and tertiary boronic esters with electron-rich aromatics is reported. The reaction involves initial formation of a boronate complex followed by activation of the electron-rich aromatic moiety by an electrophile, which triggers a stereospecific 1,2-migration and subsequent elimination/re-aromatization.

Iterative reactions of transient boronic acids enable sequential C–C bond formation

The ability to form multiple carbon–carbon bonds in a controlled sequence and thus rapidly build molecular complexity in an iterative fashion is an important goal in modern chemical synthesis. In recent times, transition-metal-catalysed coupling reactions have dominated in the development of C–C bond forming processes. A desire to reduce the reliance on precious metals and a need to obtain products with very low levels of metal impurities has brought a renewed focus on metal-free coupling processes. Here, we report the in situ preparation of reactive allylic and benzylic boronic acids, obtained by reacting flow-generated diazo compounds with boronic acids, and their application in controlled iterative C–C bond forming reactions is described. Thus far we have shown the formation of up to three C–C bonds in a sequence including the final trapping of a reactive boronic acid species with an aldehyde to generate a range of new chemical structures. The ability to form multiple carbon–carbon bonds in a controlled sequence represents an important goal in modern chemical synthesis. Here, the in situ preparation of reactive allylic and benzylic boronic acids, obtained by reacting flow-generated diazo compounds with boronic acids, and their application in controlled iterative C–C bond forming reactions is described.

Twin disulfides for orthogonal disulfide pairing and the directed folding of multicyclic peptides

Multicyclic peptides are emerging as an exciting platform for drug and targeted ligand discovery owing to their expected greater target affinity/selectivity/stability versus linear or monocyclic peptides. However, although the precise pairing of cysteine residues in proteins is routinely achieved in nature, the rational pairing of cysteine residues within polypeptides is a long-standing challenge for the preparation of multicyclic species containing several disulfide bridges. Here, we present an efficient and straightforward approach for directing the intermolecular and intramolecular pairing of cysteine residues within peptides using a minimal CXC motif. Orthogonal disulfide pairing can be exploited in complex redox media to rationally produce dimeric peptides and bi/tricyclic peptides from fully reduced peptides containing 1–6 cysteine residues. This strategy, which does not rely on extensive manipulation of the primary sequence, post-translational modification or protecting groups, should greatly benefit the development of multicyclic peptide therapeutics and targeting ligands. The precise pairing of cysteine residues in proteins is routinely achieved in nature. However, the comparable pairing within polypeptides is a long-standing challenge for the preparation of multicyclic species. Here, a straightforward approach to direct the inter-/intramolecular pairing of cysteine residues within peptides using a minimal CXC motif is presented.

Title: 
Parameterization of phosphine ligands reveals mechanistic pathways and predicts reaction outcomes

The mechanistic foundation behind the identity of a phosphine ligand that best promotes a desired reaction outcome is often non-intuitive, and thus has been addressed in numerous experimental and theoretical studies. In this work, multivariate correlations of reaction outcomes using 38 different phosphine ligands were combined with classic potentiometric analyses to study a Suzuki reaction, for which the site selectivity of oxidative addition is highly dependent on the nature of the phosphine. These studies shed light on the generality of hypotheses regarding the structural influence of different classes of phosphine ligands on the reaction mechanism(s), and deliver a methodology that should prove useful in future studies of phosphine ligands. The choice of ligand used in a reaction can drastically influence the overall outcome. Using a combination of classic physical organic chemistry and modern mathematical modelling, phosphine ligand effects are probed. The methods described provide the groundwork for future mechanistic studies of this ubiquitous ligand class.

Structural snapshots of concerted double E–H bond activation at a transition metal centre

Bond activation at a transition metal centre is a key fundamental step in numerous chemical transformations. The oxidative addition of element–hydrogen bonds, for example, represents a critical step in a range of widely applied catalytic processes. Despite this, experimental studies defining steps along the bond activation pathway are very rare. In this work, we report on fundamental studies defining a double oxidative activation pathway: combined experimental and computational approaches yield structural snapshots of the simultaneous activation of both bonds of a β-diketiminate-stabilized GaH2 unit at a single metal centre. Systematic variation of the supporting phosphine ligands and single crystal X-ray/neutron diffraction are exploited in tandem to allow structural visualization of the activation process, from a η2-H,H σ-complex showing little Ga–H bond activation, through species of intermediate geometry featuring stretched Ga–H and compressed M–H/M–Ga bonds, to a fully activated metal dihydride featuring a neutral (carbene-type) N-heterocyclic GaI ligand. X-ray and neutron diffraction studies, in conjunction with quantum chemical techniques, have been used to define a new oxidative bond activation pathway that involves simultaneous activation of both bonds of a β-diketiminate-stabilized GaH2 unit at a single metal centre.

Charge-ordering transition in iron oxide Fe4O5 involving competing dimer and trimer formation

Phase transitions that occur in materials, driven, for instance, by changes in temperature or pressure, can dramatically change the materials’ properties. Discovering new types of transitions and understanding their mechanisms is important not only from a fundamental perspective, but also for practical applications. Here we investigate a recently discovered Fe4O5 that adopts an orthorhombic CaFe3O5-type crystal structure that features linear chains of Fe ions. On cooling below ∼150 K, Fe4O5 undergoes an unusual charge-ordering transition that involves competing dimeric and trimeric ordering within the chains of Fe ions. This transition is concurrent with a significant increase in electrical resistivity. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements and neutron diffraction establish the formation of a collinear antiferromagnetic order above room temperature and a spin canting at 85 K that gives rise to spontaneous magnetization. We discuss possible mechanisms of this transition and compare it with the trimeronic charge ordering observed in magnetite below the Verwey transition temperature. Phase transitions in materials are intriguing, and can also be of practical importance. Below ∼150 K, mixed-valent iron oxide Fe4O5 has now been shown to undergo an unusual charge-ordering phase transition that involves the competing formation of iron dimers and trimers, and leads to a significant increase in electrical resistivity.

Lack of evidence for phase-only control of retinal photoisomerization in the strict one-photon limit

The concept of shaping electric fields to steer light-induced processes coherently has fascinated scientists for decades. Despite early theoretical considerations that ruled out one-photon coherent control (CC), several experimental studies reported that molecular responses are sensitive to the shape of the excitation field in the weak-field limit. These observations were largely attributed to the presence of rapid-decay channels, but experimental verification is lacking. Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating the degree of achievable control over the photoisomerization of the retinal protonated Schiff-base in bacteriorhodopsin, isorhodopsin and rhodopsin, all of which exhibit similar chromophores but different isomerization yields and excited-state lifetimes. Irrespective of the system studied, we find no evidence for dissipation-dependent behaviour, nor for any CC in the strict one-photon limit. Our results question the extent to which a photochemical process at ambient conditions can be controlled at the amplitude level, and how the underlying molecular potential-energy surfaces and dynamics may influence this controllability. The degree to which light-induced processes are sensitive to the shape of an incident electromagnetic wave remains a hotly debated topic. Experiments performed at very low levels of light agree with seminal theoretical predictions that tuning the phase of the light field does not affect photochemical reactivity at the single-photon level.

Gram-scale synthesis of two-dimensional polymer crystals and their structure analysis by X-ray diffraction

The rise of graphene, a natural two-dimensional polymer (2DP) with topologically planar repeat units, has challenged synthetic chemistry, and has highlighted that accessing equivalent covalently bonded sheet-like macromolecules has, until recently, not been achieved. Here we show that non-centrosymmetric, enantiomorphic single crystals of a simple-to-make monomer can be photochemically converted into chiral 2DP crystals and cleanly reversed back to the monomer. X-ray diffraction established unequivocal structural proof for this synthetic 2DP, which has an all-carbon scaffold and can be synthesized on the gram scale. The monomer crystals are highly robust, can be easily grown to sizes greater than 1 mm and the resulting 2DP crystals exfoliated into nanometre-thin sheets. This unique combination of features suggests that these 2DPs could find use in membranes and nonlinear optics. Accessing synthetic two-dimensional polymers that are analogous to graphene is synthetically and analytically challenging. Now, single crystals of a simple-to-make monomer have been grown and then photopolymerized to form layered single crystals of covalently bonded two-dimensional polymer. Much like natural graphite, these crystals can be exfoliated to form thin sheets and single layers of the polymer.

Stereochemical plasticity modulates cooperative binding in a CoII12L6 cuboctahedron

Biomolecular receptors are able to process information by responding differentially to combinations of chemical signals. Synthetic receptors that are likewise capable of multi-stimuli response can form the basis of programmable molecular systems, wherein specific input sequences create distinct outputs. Here we report a pseudo-cuboctahedral assembly capable of cooperatively binding anionic and neutral guest species. The binding of pairs of fullerene guests was observed to effect the all-or-nothing cooperative templation of an S6-symmetric host stereoisomer. This bis-fullerene adduct exhibits different cooperativity in binding pairs of anions from the fullerene-free parent: in one case, positive cooperativity is observed, while in another all binding affinities are enhanced by an order of magnitude, and in a third the binding events are only minimally perturbed. This intricate modulation of binding affinity, and thus cooperativity, renders our new cuboctahedral receptor attractive for incorporation into systems with complex, programmable responses to different sets of stimuli. An interconverting system of three distinct stereoisomers of a cuboctahedral CoII-based cage is able to regulate the binding affinities of large anionic guests. Through cooperative templation with fullerene guests, the cage converts into a desymmetrized cage that in turn exhibits positive cooperativity in binding of an icosahedral anion; this interaction is anti-cooperative in the fullerene-free parent.

Title: 
The energy barrier in singlet fission can be overcome through coherent coupling and entropic gain

One strategy to improve solar-cell efficiency is to generate two excited electrons from just one photon through singlet fission, which is the conversion of a singlet (S1) into two triplet (T1) excitons. For efficient singlet fission it is believed that the cumulative energy of the triplet states should be no more than that of S1. However, molecular analogues that satisfy this energetic requirement do not show appreciable singlet fission, whereas crystalline tetracene displays endothermic singlet fission with near-unity quantum yield. Here we probe singlet fission in tetracene by directly following the intermediate multiexciton (ME) state. The ME state is isoenergetic with 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;T1, but fission is not activated thermally. Rather, an S1&nbsp;⇔&nbsp;ME superposition formed through a quantum-coherent process allows access to the higher-energy ME. We attribute entropic gain in crystalline tetracene as the driving force for the subsequent decay of S1&nbsp;⇔&nbsp;ME into 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;T1, which leads to a high singlet-fission yield. Better understanding of the mechanisms of singlet fission may facilitate its implementation in solar cells, improving their efficiency. Although singlet fission in tetracene is endothermic, it is now observed not to be thermally activated; rather a quantum coherent process allows access to the higher-energy multi-exciton state, which then forms two triplet excitons through an entropic driving force.

Stereoelectronic switching in single-molecule junctions

A new intersection between reaction chemistry and electronic circuitry is emerging from the ultraminiaturization of electronic devices. Over decades chemists have developed a nuanced understanding of stereoelectronics to establish how the electronic properties of molecules relate to their conformation; the recent advent of single-molecule break-junction techniques provides the means to alter this conformation with a level of control previously unimagined. Here we unite these ideas by demonstrating the first single-molecule switch that operates through a stereoelectronic effect. We demonstrate this behaviour in permethyloligosilanes with methylthiomethyl electrode linkers. The strong σ conjugation in the oligosilane backbone couples the stereoelectronic properties of the sulfur–methylene σ bonds that terminate the molecule. Theoretical calculations support the existence of three distinct dihedral conformations that differ drastically in their electronic character. We can shift between these three species by simply lengthening or compressing the molecular junction, and, in doing so, we can switch conductance digitally between two states. Creating molecular components with controllable electronic properties is crucial to the realization of nanoscale devices. Now, a single-molecule conductance switch that operates through a stereoelectronic effect has been developed. The sub-ångström control of a scanning tunnelling microscope is used to switch reversibly between two distinct sets of rotational isomers, which differ greatly in their electronic character.

Optimized orthogonal translation of unnatural amino acids enables spontaneous protein double-labelling and FRET

The ability to introduce different biophysical probes into defined positions in target proteins will provide powerful approaches for interrogating protein structure, function and dynamics. However, methods for site-specifically incorporating multiple distinct unnatural amino acids are hampered by their low efficiency. Here we provide a general solution to this challenge by developing an optimized orthogonal translation system that uses amber and evolved quadruplet-decoding transfer RNAs to encode numerous pairs of distinct unnatural amino acids into a single protein expressed in Escherichia coli with a substantial increase in efficiency over previous methods. We also provide a general strategy for labelling pairs of encoded unnatural amino acids with different probes via rapid and spontaneous reactions under physiological conditions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by genetically directing the labelling of several pairs of sites in calmodulin with fluorophores and probing protein structure and dynamics by Förster resonance energy transfer. A series of quadruplet decoding tRNAs has been developed to form an optimized orthogonal translation system. These tRNAs enable efficient, site-specific incorporation of multiple unnatural amino acids into a protein, with a substantial increase in yield over previous methods. The amino acids are then used to site-specifically label a protein with a pair of fluorophores, enabling studies of the protein's dynamics.

Calculations predict a stable molecular crystal of N8

Nitrogen, one of the most abundant elements in nature, forms the highly stable N2 molecule in its elemental state. In contrast, polynitrogen compounds comprising only nitrogen atoms are rare, and no molecular crystal made of these compounds has been prepared. Here, we predict the existence of such a molecular solid, consisting of N8 molecules, that is metastable even at ambient pressure. In the solid state, the N8 monomers retain the same structure and bonding pattern as those they adopt in the gas phase. The interactions that bind N8 molecules together are weak van der Waals and electrostatic forces. The solid is, according to calculations, more stable than a previously reported polymeric nitrogen solid, including at low pressure (below 20&nbsp;GPa). The structure and properties of the N8 molecular crystal are discussed and a possible preparation strategy is suggested. Polynitrogen compounds are of interest on a fundamental level and as potential high-energy-density materials. A crystalline solid that consists of two isomeric forms of N8 molecules held together by weak van der Waals interactions has now been predicted to exist, and to be stable even at low pressures.

Topological insulator nanostructures for near-infrared transparent flexible electrodes

Topological insulators are an intriguing class of materials with an insulating bulk state and gapless Dirac-type edge/surface states. Recent theoretical work predicts that few-layer topological insulators are promising candidates for broadband and high-performance optoelectronic devices due to their spin-momentum-locked massless Dirac edge/surface states, which are topologically protected against all time-reversal-invariant perturbations. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of near-infrared transparent flexible electrodes based on few-layer topological-insulator Bi2Se3 nanostructures epitaxially grown on mica substrates by means of van der Waals epitaxy. The large, continuous, Bi2Se3-nanosheet transparent electrodes have single Dirac cone surface states, and exhibit sheet resistances as low as ~330&nbsp;Ω per square, with a transparency of more than 70% over a wide range of wavelengths. Furthermore, Bi2Se3-nanosheet transparent electrodes show high chemical and thermal stabilities as well as excellent mechanical durability, which may lead to novel optoelectronic devices with unique properties. Transparent conductive electrodes are widely used in modern optoelectronic devices, but they are rarely transparent in the near-infrared, limiting their use. Nanostructured bismuth selenide, a topological insulator, is now shown to be a flexible near-infrared transparent electrode.

Spatially resolved analysis of short-range structure perturbations in a plastically bent molecular crystal

The exceptional mechanical flexibility observed with certain organic crystals defies the common perception of single crystals as brittle objects. Here, we describe the morphostructural consequences of plastic deformation in crystals of hexachlorobenzene that can be bent mechanically at multiple locations to 360° with retention of macroscopic integrity. This extraordinary plasticity proceeds by segregation of the bent section into flexible layers that slide on top of each other, thereby generating domains with slightly different lattice orientations. Microscopic, spectroscopic and diffraction analyses of the bent crystal showed that the preservation of crystal integrity when stress is applied on the (001) face requires sliding of layers by breaking and re-formation of halogen–halogen interactions. Application of stress on the (100) face, in the direction where π···π interactions dominate the packing, leads to immediate crystal disintegration. Within a broader perspective, this study highlights the yet unrecognized extraordinary malleability of molecular crystals with strongly anisotropic supramolecular interactions. Crystals of hexachlorobenzene easily break when pressed on the (100) face, but bend to 360° without disintegrating when stress is applied on the (001) face. In the latter case this extraordinary malleability arises from the segregation and sliding of layers of molecules in the crystal, a process in which halogen–halogen interactions are broken and reformed.

A boron–boron coupling reaction between two ethyl cation analogues

The design of larger architectures from smaller molecular building blocks by element–element coupling reactions is one of the key concerns of synthetic chemistry, so a number of strategies were developed for this bottom-up approach. A general scheme is the coupling of two elements with opposing polarity or that of two radicals. Here, we show that a B–B coupling reaction is possible between two boron analogues of the ethyl cation, resulting in the formation of an unprecedented dicationic tetraborane. The bonding properties in the rhomboid B4 core of the product can be described as two B–B units connected by three-centre, two-electron bonds, sharing the short diagonal. Our discovery might lead the way to the long sought-after boron chain polymers with a structure similar to the silicon chains in β-SiB3. Moreover, the reaction is a prime textbook example of the influence of multiple-centre bonding on reactivity. A stable tetranuclear boron dication with a rhomboid B4 skeleton has been formed by B–B coupling between two diborane cations. In the course of this unusual reaction — which is not feasible for the isolobal ethyl cation analogues — two electron-precise B–B bonds are converted into two B–B–B three-centre bonds.

Supramolecular regulation of bioorthogonal catalysis in cells using nanoparticle-embedded transition metal catalysts

Bioorthogonal catalysis broadens the functional possibilities of intracellular chemistry. Effective delivery and regulation of synthetic catalytic systems in cells are challenging due to the complex intracellular environment and catalyst instability. Here, we report the fabrication of protein-sized bioorthogonal nanozymes through the encapsulation of hydrophobic transition metal catalysts into the monolayer of water-soluble gold nanoparticles. The activity of these catalysts can be reversibly controlled by binding a supramolecular cucurbit[7]uril ‘gate-keeper’ onto the monolayer surface, providing a biomimetic control mechanism that mimics the allosteric regulation of enzymes. The potential of this gated nanozyme for use in imaging and therapeutic applications was demonstrated through triggered cleavage of allylcarbamates for pro-fluorophore activation and propargyl groups for prodrug activation inside living cells. Regulation of bioorthogonal catalysis in living systems is challenging because of the complex intracellular environment. Now, the activity of protein-sized bioorthogonal nanozymes has been regulated by binding a supramolecular cucurbit[7]uril ‘gate-keeper’ onto the monolayer surface. This arrangement enables the controlled activation of profluorophores and prodrugs inside living cells for imaging and therapeutic applications.

Accurate first-principles structures and energies of diversely bonded systems from an efficient density functional

One atom or molecule binds to another through various types of bond, the strengths of which range from several meV to several eV. Although some computational methods can provide accurate descriptions of all bond types, those methods are not efficient enough for many studies (for example, large systems, ab initio molecular dynamics and high-throughput searches for functional materials). Here, we show that the recently developed non-empirical strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) within the density functional theory framework predicts accurate geometries and energies of diversely bonded molecules and materials (including covalent, metallic, ionic, hydrogen and van der Waals bonds). This represents a significant improvement at comparable efficiency over its predecessors, the GGAs that currently dominate materials computation. Often, SCAN matches or improves on the accuracy of a computationally expensive hybrid functional, at almost-GGA cost. SCAN is therefore expected to have a broad impact on chemistry and materials science. Whether a molecule or material can exist, and with what structures and energies, is of critical importance. For demanding calculations the efficiency of density functional theory makes it the only practical electronic structure theory available to help answer these questions. Now, an efficient density functional is shown to have unprecedented accuracy for a diverse set of bonded systems.

The total synthesis of hyperpapuanone, hyperibone L, epi-clusianone and oblongifolin A

Polyprenylated polycyclic acylphloroglucines (PPAPs) are a family of natural products that possess a wide range of different important biological activities because of the relative position and configuration of four substituents that decorate one common central bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,4,9-trione core. The rigid bicyclic framework with its lipophilic side chains and its hydrophilic trione moiety represents a nature-derived lead structure that arranges the substituents (R1 to R4) into a defined topographical orientation. As the substituents are responsible for the biological activities, the seven-step synthetic approach presented here sets the stage for an iterative introduction of R1 to R4 and thus generates structurally diverse trans-type B PPAPs. Four natural and one non-natural trans-type B PPAPs were prepared starting from acetylacetone with overall yields that ranged from 6 to 22%. The concept of separating framework construction from decorating transformations plus the minimization of protecting-group operations are the key issues for the realization of our synthetic approach. The polyprenylated polycyclic acylphloroglucines (PPAPs) are a family of natural products in which a common core is decorated with four different substituents. Here, a synthetic strategy is presented that separates the core building steps from the core decorating steps, offering a general solution to the synthesis of these natural products that will allow investigation of their biological activities.

Light-triggered self-construction of supramolecular organic nanowires as metallic interconnects

The construction of soft and processable organic material able to display metallic conduction properties—a large density of freely moving charges—is a major challenge for electronics. Films of doped conjugated polymers are widely used as semiconductor devices, but metallic-type transport in the bulk of such materials remains extremely rare. On the other hand, single-walled carbon nanotubes can exhibit remarkably low contact resistances with related large currents, but are intrinsically very difficult to isolate and process. Here, we describe the self-assembly of supramolecular organic nanowires between two metallic electrodes, from a solution of triarylamine derivative, under the simultaneous action of light and electric field triggers. They exhibit a combination of large conductivity values (&gt;5&nbsp;×&nbsp;103&nbsp;S&nbsp;m−1) and a low interface resistance (&lt;2&nbsp;×&nbsp;10−4&nbsp;Ω&nbsp;m). Moreover, the resistance of nanowires in series with metal interfaces systematically decreases when the temperature is lowered to 1.5&nbsp;K, revealing an intrinsic metallic behaviour. Triarylamine derivatives in solution have been self-assembled into organic nanowires between two electrodes, under white-light irradiation and in the presence of a voltage. The resulting fibres possess a very high electric conductivity as well as a metallic behaviour when cooled down to a temperature of 1.5 K.

Redox-inactive metals modulate the reduction potential in heterometallic manganese–oxido clusters

Redox-inactive metals are found in biological and heterogeneous water oxidation catalysts, but, at present, their roles in catalysis are not well understood. Here, we report a series of high-oxidation-state tetranuclear-dioxido clusters comprising three manganese centres and a redox-inactive metal (M). Crystallographic studies show an unprecedented Mn3M(µ4-O)(µ2-O) core that remains intact on changing M or the manganese oxidation state. Electrochemical studies reveal that the reduction potentials span a window of 700&nbsp;mV and are dependent on the Lewis acidity of the second metal. With the pKa of the redox-inactive metal–aqua complex as a measure of Lewis acidity, these compounds demonstrate a linear dependence between reduction potential and acidity with a slope of ∼100&nbsp;mV per pKa unit. The Sr2+ and Ca2+ compounds show similar potentials, an observation that correlates with the behaviour of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, which is active only if one of these two metals is present. The presence of Ca2+ is essential for the activity of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of Photosystem II, although its exact role is still unclear. Now, electrochemical measurements of structural mimics of the OEC — based on mixed-metal trimanganese dioxido complexes — reveal a correlation between the Lewis acidity of the redox-inactive metal and the reduction potential of the complex.

Poly(zwitterionic)protein conjugates offer increased stability without sacrificing binding affinity or bioactivity

Treatment with therapeutic proteins is an attractive approach to targeting a number of challenging diseases. Unfortunately, the native proteins themselves are often unstable in physiological conditions, reducing bioavailability and therefore increasing the dose that is required. Conjugation with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is often used to increase stability, but this has a detrimental effect on bioactivity. Here, we introduce conjugation with zwitterionic polymers such as poly(carboxybetaine). We show that poly(carboxybetaine) conjugation improves stability in a manner similar to PEGylation, but that the new conjugates retain or even improve the binding affinity as a result of enhanced protein–substrate hydrophobic interactions. This chemistry opens a new avenue for the development of protein therapeutics by avoiding the need to compromise between stability and affinity. Poly(ethylene glycol) conjugates have been widely used to improve the stability of proteins for use as therapeutics, but this stability comes at the expense of binding affinity. Here, poly(carboxybetaine) — a zwitterionic polymer — is shown to provide increased stability while also enhancing binding due to its super-hydrophilic nature.

Total synthesis of marinomycin A using salicylate as a molecular switch to mediate dimerization

Antibiotics play a significant role in human health because of their ability to treat life-threatening bacterial infections. The growing problems with antibiotic resistance have made the development of new antibiotics a World Health Organization priority. Marinomycin A is a member of a new class of bis-salicylate-containing polyene macrodiolides, which have potent antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Herein, we describe a triply convergent synthesis of this agent using the salicylate as a novel molecular switch for the chemoselective construction of the macrodiolide. This strategy raises new questions regarding the biosynthetic role of the salicylate and its potential impact on the mechanism of action of these types of agents. For instance, in contrast to penicillin, which enhances the electrophilicity of the cyclic amide through ring strain, salicylates reduce the electrophilicity of the aryl ester through an intramolecular resonance-assisted hydrogen bond to provide an amide surrogate. Marinomycin A is a member of a new class of bis-salicylate-containing polyene macrodiolide, with potent antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF). Here, a triply convergent synthesis of this agent is described that uses the salicylate moiety as a novel molecular switch for the chemoselective construction of the macrodiolide.

Title: 
A strategy for the diversity-oriented synthesis of macrocyclic scaffolds using multidimensional coupling

A prerequisite for successful screening campaigns in drug discovery or chemical genetics is the availability of structurally and thus functionally diverse compound libraries. Diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) provides strategies for the generation of such libraries, of which the build/couple/pair (B/C/P) algorithm is the most frequently used. We have developed an advanced B/C/P strategy that incorporates multidimensional coupling. In this approach, structural diversity is not only defined by the nature of the building blocks employed, but also by the linking motif installed during the coupling reaction. We applied this step-efficient approach in a DOS of a library that consisted of 73 macrocyclic compounds based around 59 discrete scaffolds. The macrocycles prepared cover a broad range of different molecular shapes, as illustrated by principal moment-of-inertia analysis. This demonstrates the capability of the advanced B/C/P strategy using multidimensional coupling for the preparation of structurally diverse compound collections. Diversity oriented synthesis (DOS) aims to build structurally diverse compound libraries — potentially useful in drug discovery — from a small number of starting materials. Here, the build/couple/pair algorithm — commonly used in DOS — is extended to incorporate variations in the coupling step as well as in the starting materials. This produces a compound library with exceptionally high diversity in fewer than five steps from a common precursor.

An eight-step synthesis of epicolactone reveals its biosynthetic origin

Epicolactone is a recently isolated fungal metabolite that is highly complex for its size, and yet racemic. With its array of quaternary stereocentres, high degree of functionalization and intricate polycyclic structure, it poses a considerable challenge to synthesis, a challenge that can be met by understanding its biosynthetic origin. If drawn in a certain way, epicolactone reveals a pattern that resembles purpurogallin, the archetype of ubiquitous natural colourants formed via oxidative dimerization. Based on this insight, we designed a biomimetic synthesis of epicolactone that proceeds in only eight steps from vanillyl alcohol. We have isolated a key intermediate that supports our biosynthetic hypothesis and anticipate that an isomer of epicolactone stemming from our synthetic efforts could also be found as a natural product. Analysis of the structure of the highly complex yet racemic secondary metabolite epicolactone suggests that it may arise biosynthetically from a cascade similar to that which produces purpurogallin. This led to a synthesis of epicolactone in only eight steps using an intricate reaction cascade.

Title: 
A Star of David catenane

We describe the synthesis of a [2]catenane that consists of two triply entwined 114-membered rings, a molecular link. The woven scaffold is a hexameric circular helicate generated by the assembly of six tris(bipyridine) ligands with six iron(II) cations, with the size of the helicate promoted by the use of sulfate counterions. The structure of the ligand extension directs subsequent covalent capture of the catenane by ring-closing olefin metathesis. Confirmation of the Star of David topology (two rings, six crossings) is provided by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. Extraction of the iron(II) ions with tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate affords the wholly organic molecular link. The self-assembly of interwoven circular frameworks of controlled size, and their subsequent closure by multiple directed covalent bond-forming reactions, provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of molecular topologies of ever-increasing complexity. The Star of David topology is an iconic symbol that has been used in religious and cultural contexts for thousands of years. Now it is assembled in molecular form through a hexameric circular helicate generated by six tris(bipyridine) ligands entwined about six iron(II) cations. The structure of the two triply-entwined 114-membered rings is revealed by X-ray crystallography.

Total synthesis and structure–activity relationship studies of a series of selective G protein inhibitors

G proteins are key mediators of G protein-coupled receptor signalling, which facilitates a plethora of important physiological processes. The cyclic depsipeptides YM-254890 and FR900359 are the only known specific inhibitors of the Gq subfamily of G proteins; however, no synthetic route has been reported previously for these complex natural products and they are not easily isolated from natural sources. Here we report the first total synthesis of YM-254890 and FR900359, as well as of two known analogues, YM-385780 and YM-385781. The versatility of the synthetic approach also enabled the design and synthesis of ten analogues, which provided the first structure–activity relationship study for this class of compounds. Pharmacological characterization of all the compounds at Gq-, Gi- and Gs-mediated signalling provided succinct information on the structural requirements for inhibition, and demonstrated that both YM-254890 and FR900359 are highly potent inhibitors of Gq signalling, with FR900359 being the most potent. These natural products and their analogues represent unique tools for explorative studies of G protein inhibition. G proteins are the key mediators of G protein-coupled receptor signalling, facilitating a number of important physiological processes. Now, the total synthesis and structure–activity relationship studies have been reported for the only known selective Gq protein inhibitors, the natural cyclic depsipeptides YM-254890 and FR900359.

Assembly of a biocompatible triazole-linked gene by one-pot click-DNA ligation

The chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides and their enzyme-mediated assembly into genes and genomes has significantly advanced multiple scientific disciplines. However, these approaches are not without their shortcomings; enzymatic amplification and ligation of oligonucleotides into genes and genomes makes automation challenging, and site-specific incorporation of epigenetic information and/or modified bases into large constructs is not feasible. Here we present a fully chemical one-pot method for the assembly of oligonucleotides into a gene by click-DNA ligation. We synthesize the 335 base-pair gene that encodes the green fluorescent protein iLOV from ten functionalized oligonucleotides that contain 5ʹ-azide and 3ʹ-alkyne units. The resulting click-linked iLOV gene contains eight triazoles at the sites of chemical ligation, and yet is fully biocompatible; it is replicated by DNA polymerases in vitro and encodes a functional iLOV protein in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate the power and potential of our one-pot gene-assembly method by preparing an epigenetically modified variant of the iLOV gene. A 335 base-pair gene encoding the green fluorescent protein iLOV and an epigenetically modified variant have now been assembled by click-DNA ligation of ten functionalized oligonucleotides. The resulting fully synthetic gene contained eight triazoles at the sites of chemical ligation, yet the synthetic gene was shown to be fully biocompatible in Escherichia coli.

Title: 
Activating lattice oxygen redox reactions in metal oxides to catalyse oxygen evolution

Understanding how materials that catalyse the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) function is essential for the development of efficient energy-storage technologies. The traditional understanding of the OER mechanism on metal oxides involves four concerted proton–electron transfer steps on metal-ion centres at their surface and product oxygen molecules derived from water. Here, using in situ18O isotope labelling mass spectrometry, we provide direct experimental evidence that the O2 generated during the OER on some highly active oxides can come from lattice oxygen. The oxides capable of lattice-oxygen oxidation also exhibit pH-dependent OER activity on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale, indicating non-concerted proton–electron transfers in the OER mechanism. Based on our experimental data and density functional theory calculations, we discuss mechanisms that are fundamentally different from the conventional scheme and show that increasing the covalency of metal–oxygen bonds is critical to trigger lattice-oxygen oxidation and enable non-concerted proton–electron transfers during OER. Understanding how oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) catalysts work is important for the development of efficient energy storage technologies. It has now been shown that lattice oxygen participates in O2 generation during the OER on some highly active metal oxides and that this behaviour becomes more prevalent with greater metal–oxygen covalency.

Magnetic blocking in a linear iron(I) complex

Single-molecule magnets that contain one spin centre may represent the smallest possible unit for spin-based computational devices. Such applications, however, require the realization of molecules with a substantial energy barrier for spin inversion, achieved through a large axial magnetic anisotropy. Recently, significant progress has been made in this regard by using lanthanide centres such as terbium(III) and dysprosium(III), whose anisotropy can lead to extremely high relaxation barriers. We contend that similar effects should be achievable with transition metals by maintaining a low coordination number to restrict the magnitude of the d-orbital ligand-field splitting energy (which tends to hinder the development of large anisotropies). Herein we report the first two-coordinate complex of iron(I), [Fe(C(SiMe3)3)2]−, for which alternating current magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal slow magnetic relaxation below 29&nbsp;K in a zero applied direct-current field. This S&nbsp;=&nbsp; complex exhibits an effective spin-reversal barrier of Ueff&nbsp;=&nbsp;226(4)&nbsp;cm−1, the largest yet observed for a single-molecule magnet based on a transition metal, and displays magnetic blocking below 4.5&nbsp;K. Mononuclear complexes of certain lanthanide ions are known to have large magnetization reversal barriers caused by strong spin–orbit coupling. Now, careful tuning of the ligand field of a transition metal complex has engendered a comparable spin-reversal barrier — and in turn magnetic blocking at 4.5&nbsp;K.

A near-infrared fluorophore for live-cell super-resolution microscopy of cellular proteins

The ideal fluorescent probe for bioimaging is bright, absorbs at long wavelengths and can be implemented flexibly in living cells and in vivo. However, the design of synthetic fluorophores that combine all of these properties has proved to be extremely difficult. Here, we introduce a biocompatible near-infrared silicon–rhodamine probe that can be coupled specifically to proteins using different labelling techniques. Importantly, its high permeability and fluorogenic character permit the imaging of proteins in living cells and tissues, and its brightness and photostability make it ideally suited for live-cell super-resolution microscopy. The excellent spectroscopic properties of the probe combined with its ease of use in live-cell applications make it a powerful new tool for bioimaging. Fluorescent probes for bioimaging need to exhibit bright fluorescence, be biocompatible and offer several alternatives for attachment to biomolecules of interest. Here, a near-infrared silicon–rhodamine fluorophore is introduced that can be coupled to intracellular proteins in live cells and tissues and can be exploited for super-resolution microscopy.

Controlling quantum-beating signals in 2D electronic spectra by packing synthetic heterodimers on single-walled carbon nanotubes

In multidimensional spectroscopy, dynamics of coherences between excited states report on the interactions between electronic states and their environment. The prolonged coherence lifetimes revealed through beating signals in the spectra of some systems may result from vibronic coupling between nearly degenerate excited states, and recent observations confirm the existence of such coupling in both model systems and photosynthetic complexes. Understanding the origin of beating signals in the spectra of photosynthetic complexes has been given considerable attention; however, strategies to generate them in artificial systems that would allow us to test the hypotheses in detail are still lacking. Here we demonstrate control over the presence of quantum-beating signals by packing structurally flexible synthetic heterodimers on single-walled carbon nanotubes, and thereby restrict the motions of chromophores. Using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, we find that both limiting the relative rotation of chromophores and tuning the energy difference between the two electronic transitions in the dimer to match a vibrational mode of the lower-energy monomer are necessary to enhance the observed quantum-beating signals. Synthetic heterodimers provide a platform to demonstrate molecular design principles of vibronic coupling. Now, it has been shown that quantum beating caused by vibronic coupling can be controlled by packing a structurally flexible heterodimer on single-walled carbon nanotubes. This quantum beating requires a vibration to be resonant with the energy gap between excited states and structural rigidity.

Ion mobility–mass spectrometry of a rotary ATPase reveals ATP-induced reduction in conformational flexibility

Rotary ATPases play fundamental roles in energy conversion as their catalytic rotation is associated with interdomain fluctuations and heterogeneity of conformational states. Using ion mobility mass spectrometry we compared the conformational dynamics of the intact ATPase from Thermus thermophilus with those of its membrane and soluble subcomplexes. Our results define regions with enhanced flexibility assigned to distinct subunits within the overall assembly. To provide a structural context for our experimental data we performed molecular dynamics simulations and observed conformational changes of the peripheral stalks that reflect their intrinsic flexibility. By isolating complexes at different phases of cell growth and manipulating nucleotides, metal ions and pH during isolation, we reveal differences that can be related to conformational changes in the Vo complex triggered by ATP binding. Together these results implicate nucleotides in modulating flexibility of the stator components and uncover mechanistic detail that underlies operation and regulation in the context of the holoenzyme. Ion mobility–mass spectrometry has enabled the study of conformation and dynamics of membrane proteins in the gas phase. Here, the enhanced flexibility of macromolecular ATPase was investigated by comparing arrival time distributions of distinct species and relating them to different solution conditions, leading to the proposal of a nucleotide-triggered regulatory mechanism.

Incorporation of well-dispersed sub-5-nm graphitic pencil nanodots into ordered mesoporous frameworks

Over the past few decades the direct assembly of optical nanomaterials into ordered mesoporous frameworks has proved to be a considerable challenge. Here we propose the incorporation of ultrasmall (sub-5-nm) graphitic pencil nanodots into ordered mesoporous frameworks for the fabrication of optoelectronic materials. The nanodots, which were prepared from typical commercial graphite pencils by an electrochemical tailoring process, combine properties such as uniform size (∼3 nm), excellent dispersibility and high photoconversion efficiency (∼27%). These nanodots were incorporated into a variety of ordered mesoporous frameworks (TiO2, silica, carbon and silica–carbon materials) by co-assembly, driven by hydrogen bonding, with the frameworks' precursors. The resulting materials showed a high degree of ordering, and a sharp increase in their optical performance (for example, photocurrent density). We envisage that the large-scale synthesis of ultrasmall carbon nanodots and their incorporation into ordered mesoporous frameworks may facilitate the preparation of materials with a variety of optical properties. Doping mesoporous materials is an attractive way to tune their properties, but typically disrupts the host materials’ structures. Ultrasmall graphitic pencil nanodots have now been prepared, doped with heteroatoms, and inserted in a well-dispersed manner within the ordered structure of mesoporous materials including TiO2, carbon and silica, by a co-assembly approach.

Real-time molecular scale observation of crystal formation

How molecules in solution form crystal nuclei, which then grow into large crystals, is a poorly understood phenomenon. The classical mechanism of homogeneous crystal nucleation proceeds via the spontaneous random aggregation of species from liquid or solution. However, a non-classical mechanism suggests the formation of an amorphous dense phase that reorders to form stable crystal nuclei. So far it has remained an experimental challenge to observe the formation of crystal nuclei from five to thirty molecules. Here, using polyoxometallates, we show that the formation of small crystal nuclei is observable by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. We observe both classical and non-classical nucleation processes, depending on the identity of the cation present. The experiments verify theoretical studies that suggest non-classical nucleation is the lower of the two energy pathways. The arrangement in just a seven-molecule proto-crystal matches the order found by X-ray diffraction of a single bulk crystal, which demonstrates that the same structure was formed in each case. Homogeneous crystal nucleation has now been observed by transmission electron microscopy in real time on a molecular scale. Countercation-dependent observations of polyoxometalate proto-crystal formation confirm existence of a higher energy classical molecular attachment mechanism, as well as a lower energy two-step mechanism via an intermediate dense phase.

Expanding the amino acid repertoire of ribosomal polypeptide synthesis via the artificial division of codon boxes

In ribosomal polypeptide synthesis the library of amino acid building blocks is limited by the manner in which codons are used. Of the proteinogenic amino acids, 18 are coded for by multiple codons and therefore many of the 61 sense codons can be considered redundant. Here we report a method to reduce the redundancy of codons by artificially dividing codon boxes to create vacant codons that can then be reassigned to non-proteinogenic amino acids and thereby expand the library of genetically encoded amino acids. To achieve this, we reconstituted a cell-free translation system with 32 in vitro transcripts of transfer RNASNN (tRNASNN) (S = G or C), assigning the initiator and 20 elongator amino acids. Reassignment of three redundant codons was achieved by replacing redundant tRNASNNs with tRNASNNs pre-charged with non-proteinogenic amino acids. As a demonstration, we expressed a 32-mer linear peptide that consists of 20 proteinogenic and three non-proteinogenic amino acids, and a 14-mer macrocyclic peptide that contains more than four non-proteinogenic amino acids. The repertoire of amino acids available for ribosomal peptide synthesis is limited by the genetic code. Now, a method to reduce the redundancy of codons has been developed based on the artificial division of codon boxes. This method enables non-proteinogenic amino acids to be included in peptides without sacrificing proteinogenic ones.

Site-selective C–H arylation of primary aliphatic amines enabled by a catalytic transient directing group

Transition-metal-catalysed direct C–H bond functionalization of aliphatic amines is of great importance in organic and medicinal chemistry research. Several methods have been developed for the direct sp3 C–H functionalization of secondary and tertiary aliphatic amines, but site-selective functionalization of primary aliphatic amines in remote positions remains a challenge. Here, we report the direct, highly site-selective γ-arylation of primary alkylamines via a palladium-catalysed C–H bond functionalization process on unactivated sp3 carbons. Using glyoxylic acid as an inexpensive, catalytic and transient directing group, a wide array of γ-arylated primary alkylamines were prepared without any protection or deprotection steps. This approach provides straightforward access to important structural motifs in organic and medicinal chemistry without the need for pre-functionalized substrates or stoichiometric directing groups and is demonstrated here in the synthesis of analogues of the immunomodulatory drug fingolimod directly from commercially available 2-amino-2-propylpropane-1,3-diol. Transition-metal-catalysed direct C(sp3)−H functionalization of primary aliphatic amines is an attractive– but elusive – process that could provide efficient access to biologically and pharmaceutically important compounds. Now, a palladium-catalysed γ-arylation of primary alkylamines is achieved using an inexpensive, catalytic and transient directing group.

Development of a minimal saponin vaccine adjuvant based on QS-21

Adjuvants are materials added to vaccines to enhance the immunological response to an antigen. QS-21 is a natural product adjuvant under investigation in numerous vaccine clinical trials, but its use is constrained by scarcity, toxicity, instability and an enigmatic molecular mechanism of action. Herein we describe the development of a minimal QS-21 analogue that decouples adjuvant activity from toxicity and provides a powerful platform for mechanistic investigations. We found that the entire branched trisaccharide domain of QS-21 is dispensable for adjuvant activity and that the C4-aldehyde substituent, previously proposed to bind covalently to an unknown cellular target, is also not required. Biodistribution studies revealed that active adjuvants were retained preferentially at the injection site and the nearest draining lymph nodes compared with the attenuated variants. Overall, these studies have yielded critical insights into saponin structure–function relationships, provided practical synthetic access to non-toxic adjuvants, and established a platform for detailed mechanistic studies. Adjuvants are used to increase the immune response to molecular vaccines. A minimal synthetic variant of the saponin natural product QS-21 has been developed as a potent, non-toxic adjuvant, enabling dissection of structural requirements in the triterpene domain and in vivo biodistribution studies to probe mechanisms of action.

Oxadiazole grafts in peptide macrocycles

Synthetic methods that provide control over macrocycle conformation and, at the same time, mitigate the polarity of peptide bonds represent valuable tools for the discovery of new bioactive molecules. Here, we report a macrocyclization reaction between a linear peptide, an aldehyde and (N-isocyanimino)triphenylphosphorane. This process generates head-to-tail cyclic peptidomimetics in a single step. This method is tolerant to variation in the peptide and aldehyde components and has been applied for the synthesis of 15-, 18-, 21- and 24-membered rings. The resulting peptide macrocycles feature a 1,3,4-oxadiazole and a tertiary amine in their scaffolds. This non-canonical backbone region acts as an endocyclic control element that promotes and stabilizes a unique intramolecular hydrogen-bond network and can lead to macrocycles with conformationally rigid turn structures. Oxadiazole-containing macrocycles can also display a high passive membrane permeability, an important property for the development of bioavailable peptide-based therapeutics. Controlling macrocycle conformation represents a powerful tool for the construction of new bioactive molecules. Now, peptide-based macrocycles bearing a 1,3,4-oxadiazole moiety grafted into their backbone have been synthesized via a new cyclization approach. The resulting cyclic products exhibit conformationally rigid turn structures (stabilized through intramolecular hydrogen bonding) that can display passive membrane permeability.

Shape-selective sieving layers on an oxide catalyst surface

New porous materials such as zeolites, metal–organic frameworks and mesostructured oxides are of immense practical utility for gas storage, separations and heterogeneous catalysis. Their extended pore structures enable selective uptake of molecules or can modify the product selectivity (regioselectivity or enantioselectivity) of catalyst sites contained within. However, diffusion within pores can be problematic for biomass and fine chemicals, and not all catalyst classes can be readily synthesized with pores of the correct dimensions. Here, we present a novel approach that adds reactant selectivity to existing, non-porous oxide catalysts by first grafting the catalyst particles with single-molecule sacrificial templates, then partially overcoating the catalyst with a second oxide through atomic layer deposition. This technique is used to create sieving layers of Al2O3 (thickness, 0.4–0.7&nbsp;nm) with ‘nanocavities’ (&lt;2&nbsp;nm in diameter) on a TiO2 photocatalyst. The additional layers result in selectivity (up to 9:1) towards less hindered reactants in otherwise unselective, competitive photocatalytic oxidations and transfer hydrogenations. Templated atomic layer deposition (ALD) is used to create oxide ‘nanocavities’ on the surface of catalyst particles. Subnanometre-nm films containing nanocavities act as sieves for the underlying catalyst, resulting in high selectivities for the smaller of two reactants in competitive oxidations or reductions.

Fabrication of carbon nanorods and graphene nanoribbons from a metal–organic framework

One- and two-dimensional carbon nanomaterials are attracting considerable attention because of their extraordinary electrical, mechanical and thermal properties, which could lead to a range of important potential applications. Synthetic processes associated with making these materials can be quite complex and also consume large amounts of energy, so a major challenge is to develop simple and efficient methods to produce them. Here, we present a self-templated, catalyst-free strategy for the synthesis of one-dimensional carbon nanorods by morphology-preserved thermal transformation of rod-shaped metal–organic frameworks. The as-synthesized non-hollow (solid) carbon nanorods can be transformed into two- to six-layered graphene nanoribbons through sonochemical treatment followed by chemical activation. The performance of these metal–organic framework-derived carbon nanorods and graphene nanoribbons in supercapacitor electrodes demonstrates that this synthetic approach can produce functionally useful materials. Moreover, this approach is readily scalable and could be used to produce carbon nanorods and graphene nanoribbons on industrial levels. A rod-shaped metal–organic framework can be converted into one-dimensional carbon nanorods through a catalyst-free thermal transformation in which the morphology of the material is preserved. The as-synthesized nanorods can be unravelled to form 2–6-layer graphene nanoribbons by ultrasonication in the presence of KOH, followed by thermal activation.

Monitoring interconversion between stereochemical states in single chirality-transfer complexes on a platinum surface

Elementary steps in enantioselective heterogeneous catalysis take place on the catalyst surface and the targeted synthesis of a desired enantiomer requires the implantation of chiral information at the surface, which can be achieved—for example—by adsorbing chiral molecules. Studies of the structures of complexes formed between adsorbed prochiral reagents and chiral molecules yield information on the forces exerting stereocontrol, but further insight could be gained by studying the dynamics of their interactions. Here, using time-lapsed scanning tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory, we observe coupling between multiple stereochemical states within individual non-covalently bonded chirality-transfer complexes on a metal surface. We identify two modes of transformation between stereochemical states and find that the prochiral reagent can sample several complexation geometries during the lifetime of a complex, switching between states of opposing prochirality in the process. These results provide insight on the contribution of individual stereochemical states to the overall enantioselectivity of reactions occurring on catalyst surfaces. A chiral molecule on a metal surface can set up a prochiral molecule for an enantioselective reaction step by forming a hydrogen-bonded complex that imposes a specific adsorption geometry. Time-lapsed scanning tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory studies reveal that such complexes can sometimes switch between states of opposing prochirality.

Diastereoselective addition of Grignard reagents to α-epoxy N-sulfonyl hydrazones

The α-alkylation of ketones and their derivatives by the addition of their corresponding enolates to alkyl halides is a fundamental synthetic transformation, but its utility is limited because the key bond-forming step proceeds in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution fashion. Here we describe how an umpolung strategy that involves the addition of Grignard reagents to α-epoxy N-sulfonyl hydrazones—directed by the alkoxide of the 1-azo-3-alkoxy propenes formed in situ via base-induced ring opening of the epoxide—leads to the syn-selective production of α-alkyl-β-hydroxy N-sulfonyl hydrazones with α-quaternary centres. This transformation is remarkable in its ability to incorporate an unprecedented range of carbon-based substituents, which include primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl, as well as alkenyl, aryl, allenyl and alkynyl groups. Subsequent hydrolysis of the β-hydroxy N-sulfonyl hydrazone products produces the corresponding β-hydroxy ketones. In addition to hydrolysis, the hydrazone products are poised to undergo numerous different known synthetic transformations via well-established chemistry, which would provide access to a wide array of useful structures. α-Substituted-β-hydroxy ketones are valuable intermediates, but their preparation by alkylation of enolates is difficult with hindered electrophiles. Now, a direct method for preparing α-substituted-β-hydroxy ketones — including those having α-quaternary centres — by addition of Grignard reagents to epoxyhydrazones has been developed, enabling the stereocontrolled incorporation of a wide range of carbon based substituents.

Catalyst-controlled oligomerization for the collective synthesis of polypyrroloindoline natural products

In nature, many organisms generate large families of natural product metabolites that have related molecular structures as a means to increase functional diversity and gain an evolutionary advantage against competing systems within the same environment. One pathway commonly employed by living systems to generate these large classes of structurally related families is oligomerization, wherein a series of enzymatically catalysed reactions is employed to generate secondary metabolites by iteratively appending monomers to a growing serial oligomer chain. The polypyrroloindolines are an interesting class of oligomeric natural products that consist of multiple cyclotryptamine subunits. Herein we describe an iterative application of asymmetric copper catalysis towards the synthesis of six distinct oligomeric polypyrroloindoline natural products: hodgkinsine, hodgkinsine B, idiospermuline, quadrigemine H and isopsychotridine B and C. Given the customizable nature of the small-molecule catalysts employed, we demonstrate that this strategy is further amenable to the construction of quadrigemine H-type alkaloids not isolated previously from natural sources. The collective synthesis of several oligomeric polypyrroloindoline natural products, including hodgkinsine, hodgkinsine B, idiospermuline, quadrigemine H and isopsychotridines B and C, is accomplished through the iterative action of an asymmetric small molecule copper catalyst. This strategy also enables the synthesis of putatively unnatural quadrigemine H-type isomers.

Synthesis of hydroxyphthioceranic acid using a traceless lithiation–borylation–protodeboronation strategy

In planning organic syntheses, disconnections are most often made adjacent to functional groups, which assist in C–C bond formation. For molecules devoid of obvious functional groups this approach presents a problem, and so functionalities must be installed temporarily and then removed. Here we present a traceless strategy for organic synthesis that uses a boronic ester as such a group in a one-pot lithiation–borylation–protodeboronation sequence. To realize this strategy, we developed a methodology for the protodeboronation of alkyl pinacol boronic esters that involves the formation of a boronate complex with a nucleophile followed by oxidation with Mn(OAc)3 in the presence of the hydrogen-atom donor 4-tert-butylcatechol. Iterative lithiation–borylation–protodeboronation allows the coupling of smaller fragments to build-up long alkyl chains. We employed this strategy in the synthesis of hydroxyphthioceranic acid, a key component of the cell-wall lipid of the virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in just 14 steps (longest linear sequence) with full stereocontrol. Coupling of carbamates with boronic esters followed by protodeboronation creates a new carbon–carbon bond, leaving behind no trace of the functional groups used to create it. Now, methodology for the protodeboronation of alkyl pinacol boronic esters has been developed and an iterative lithiation–borylation–protodeboronation strategy used in a 14-step stereocontrolled synthesis of hydroxyphthioceranic acid.

Autonomous movement of platinum-loaded stomatocytes

Polymer stomatocytes are bowl-shaped structures of nanosize dimensions formed by the controlled deformation of polymer vesicles. The stable nanocavity and strict control of the opening are ideal for the physical entrapment of nanoparticles which, when catalytically active, can turn the stomatocyte morphology into a nanoreactor. Herein we report an approach to generate autonomous movement of the polymer stomatocytes by selectively entrapping catalytically active platinum nanoparticles within their nanocavities and subsequently using catalysis as a driving force for movement. Hydrogen peroxide is free to access the inner stomatocyte cavity, where it is decomposed by the active catalyst (the entrapped platinum nanoparticles) into oxygen and water. This generates a rapid discharge, which induces thrust and directional movement. The design of the platinum-loaded stomatocytes resembles a miniature monopropellant rocket engine, in which the controlled opening of the stomatocytes directs the expulsion of the decomposition products away from the reaction chamber (inner stomatocyte cavity). A supramolecular system has been assembled that moves autonomously in the presence of a molecular fuel. Platinum nanoparticles entrapped in a polymer stomatocyte — a bowl-shaped polymer vesicle — catalyse the decomposition of the molecular fuel, hydrogen peroxide. The resulting generation of water and oxygen induces a directional movement of the stomatocyte.

Functionalization of cobalt porphyrin–phospholipid bilayers with his-tagged ligands and antigens

Methods to attach polypeptides to lipid bilayers are often indirect and ineffective, and can represent a substantial bottleneck in the formation of functionalized lipid-based materials. Although the polyhistidine tag (his-tag) has been transformative in its simplicity and efficacy in binding to immobilized metals, the successful application of this approach has been challenging in physiological settings. Here we show that lipid bilayers containing porphyrin–phospholipid conjugates that are chelated with cobalt, but not with other metals, can effectively capture his-tagged proteins and peptides. The binding follows a Co(II) to Co(III) transition and occurs within the sheltered hydrophobic bilayer, resulting in an essentially irreversible attachment in serum or in a million fold excess of competing imidazole. Using this approach we anchored homing peptides into the bilayer of preformed and cargo-loaded liposomes to enable tumour targeting without disrupting the bilayer integrity. As a further demonstration, a synthetic protein fragment derived from the human immunodeficiency virus was bound to immunogenic liposomes for potent antibody generation for an otherwise non-antigenic peptide. Lipid bilayers containing porphyin-phospholipid that is chelated with cobalt have been shown to capture his-tagged proteins and peptides. This method offers a simple route for functionalizing pre-formed lipid bilayers without disrupting their integrity. Using this approach homing peptides were attached to cargo-loaded liposomes to enable tumour targeting, and an HIV-derived protein fragment elicited antibodies following binding to immunogenic liposomes.

Title: 
Scalable enhancement of graphene oxide properties by thermally driven phase transformation

Chemical functionalization of graphene is promising for a variety of next-generation technologies. Although graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile material in this direction, its use is limited by the production of metastable, chemically inhomogeneous and spatially disordered GO structures under current synthetic protocols, which results in poor optoelectronic properties. Here, we present a mild thermal annealing procedure, with no chemical treatments involved, to manipulate as-synthesized GO on a large scale to enhance sheet properties with the oxygen content preserved. Using experiments supported by atomistic calculations, we demonstrate that GO structures undergo a phase transformation into prominent oxidized and graphitic domains by temperature-driven oxygen diffusion. Consequently, as-synthesized GO that absorbs mainly in the ultraviolet region becomes strongly absorbing in the visible region, photoluminescence is blue shifted and electronic conductivity increases by up to four orders of magnitude. Our thermal processing method offers a suitable way to tune and enhance the properties of GO, which creates opportunities for various applications. Graphene oxide sheets hold promise for a variety of applications but are disordered and inhomogeneous on synthesis. Although processes to resolve this exist they typically remove oxygen groups, affecting the sheets’ properties. Now, a scalable, mild thermal annealing procedure has been devised that enhances the optical and electronic properties of graphene oxide sheets through phase transformation, while preserving their oxygen functionality.

Title: 
On the nature and origin of dicationic, charge-separated species formed in liquid water on X-ray irradiation

To understand the yield and patterns of damage in aqueous condensed matter, including biological systems, it is essential to identify the initial products subsequent to the interaction of high-energy radiation with liquid water. Until now, the observation of several fast reactions induced by energetic particles in water was not possible on their characteristic timescales. Therefore, some of the reaction intermediates involved, particularly those that require nuclear motion, were not considered when describing radiation chemistry. Here, through a combined experimental and theoretical study, we elucidate the ultrafast proton dynamics in the first few femtoseconds after X-ray core-level ionization of liquid water. We show through isotope analysis of the Auger spectra that proton-transfer dynamics occur on the same timescale as electron autoionization. Proton transfer leads to the formation of a Zundel-type intermediate [HO*···H···H2O]+, which further ionizes to form a so-far unnoticed type of dicationic charge-separated species with high internal energy. We call the process proton-transfer mediated charge separation. Previously unobserved types of reactive species formed on the core ionization of liquid water have been identified using a combination of liquid microjet photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. The charge-separated di-cationic species are formed within a few femtoseconds, through proton-transfer-mediated processes followed by autoionization.

Title: 
Direct observation of disulfide isomerization in a single protein

Photochemical uncaging techniques use light to release active molecules from otherwise inert compounds. Here we expand this class of techniques by demonstrating the mechanical uncaging of a reactive species within a single protein. We proved this novel technique by capturing the regiospecific reaction between a thiol and a vicinal disulfide bond. We designed a protein that includes a caged cysteine and a buried disulfide. The mechanical unfolding of this protein in the presence of an external nucleophile frees the single reactive cysteine residue, which now can cleave the target disulfide via a nucleophilic attack on either one of its two sulfur atoms. This produces two different and competing reaction pathways. We used single-molecule force spectroscopy to monitor the cleavage of the disulfides, which extends the polypeptide by a magnitude unambiguously associated with each reaction pathway. This allowed us to measure, for the first time, the kinetics of disulfide-bond isomerization in a protein. Multiple redox reaction pathways exist in proteins containing several cysteines. A technique termed mechanical uncaging is now demonstrated, allowing the release of a single reactive cysteine within a protein and the unequivocal observation of subsequent thiol/disulfide exchanges. Mechanical uncaging of reactive groups is useful for studying chemical kinetics in a synchronized manner.

Title: 
A gold-catalysed enantioselective Cope rearrangement of achiral 1,5-dienes

Since the discovery of the Cope rearrangement in the 1940s, no asymmetric variant of the rearrangement of achiral 1,5-dienes has emerged, despite the successes that have been achieved with its heteroatom variants (Claisen, aza-Cope, and so on). This article reports the first example of an enantioselective Cope reaction that starts from an achiral diene. The new gold(I) catalyst derived from double Cl−-abstraction of ((S)-3,5-xylyl-PHANEPHOS(AuCl)2), has been developed for the sigmatropic rearrangement of alkenyl-methylenecyclopropanes. The reaction proceeds at low temperature and the synthetically useful vinylcyclopropane products are obtained in high yield and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory calculations predict that: (1) the reaction proceeds via a cyclic carbenium ion intermediate, (2) the relief of strain in the methylenecyclopropane moiety provides the thermodynamic driving force for the rearrangement and (3) metal complexation of the transition-state structure lowers the rearrangement barriers. The Cope rearrangement has been known since the 1940s but, until now, no catalytic asymmetric variant has been reported. Here, a gold(I) catalyst is shown to induce an asymmetric Cope rearrangement of achiral 1,5-dienes containing a cyclopropylidene moiety to produce vinyl cyclopropanes in high yield and good to excellent enantioselectivities.

Complete protein–protein association kinetics in atomic detail revealed by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov modelling

Protein–protein association is fundamental to many life processes. However, a microscopic model describing the structures and kinetics during association and dissociation is lacking on account of the long lifetimes of associated states, which have prevented efficient sampling by direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here we demonstrate protein–protein association and dissociation in atomistic resolution for the ribonuclease barnase and its inhibitor barstar by combining adaptive high-throughput MD simulations and hidden Markov modelling. The model reveals experimentally consistent intermediate structures, energetics and kinetics on timescales from microseconds to hours. A variety of flexibly attached intermediates and misbound states funnel down to a transition state and a native basin consisting of the loosely bound near-native state and the tightly bound crystallographic state. These results offer a deeper level of insight into macromolecular recognition and our approach opens the door for understanding and manipulating a wide range of macromolecular association processes. Uncovering the microscopic details of protein–protein association via direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been prevented by the excessive lifetimes of associated states. Now, association and dissociation for the barnase–barstar complex has been studied by adaptive high-throughput MD simulations and Markov modelling, revealing intermediate structures, energetics and kinetics on microseconds-to-hours timescales.

Title: 
A quantitative model for the transcription of 2D patterns into functional 3D architectures

Self-sorting on surfaces is one of the big challenges that must be addressed in preparing the organic materials of the future. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for templated self-sorting on surfaces, and validate it experimentally. In our approach, the transcription of two-dimensional information encoded in a monolayer on the surface into three-dimensional supramolecular architectures is quantified by the intrinsic templation efficiency, a thickness-independent value describing the fidelity of transcription per layer. The theoretical prediction that exceedingly high intrinsic efficiencies will be needed to experimentally observe templated self-sorting is then confirmed experimentally. Intrinsic templation efficiencies of up to 97%, achieved with a newly introduced templated synthesis strategy, result in maximal 47% effective templation efficiency at a thickness of 70 layers. The functional relevance of surface-templated self-sorting and meaningful dependences of templation efficiencies on structural modifications are demonstrated. The self-sorting of molecular building blocks should allow 2D surface patterns to be transcribed into 3D functional materials. Here, a non-empirical approach to the templated synthesis of supramolecular architectures on surfaces is reported, starting with a theoretical model and followed by comprehensive experimental validation, including direct evidence for functional relevance of the produced materials.

Title: 
Screening and classifying small-molecule inhibitors of amyloid formation using ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry

The search for therapeutic agents that bind specifically to precursor protein conformations and inhibit amyloid assembly is an important challenge. Identifying such inhibitors is difficult because many protein precursors of aggregation are partially folded or intrinsically disordered, which rules out structure-based design. Furthermore, inhibitors can act by a variety of mechanisms, including specific or nonspecific binding, as well as colloidal inhibition. Here we report a high-throughput method based on ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry (IMS–MS) that is capable of rapidly detecting small molecules that bind to amyloid precursors, identifying the interacting protein species and defining the mode of inhibition. Using this method we have classified a variety of small molecules that are potential inhibitors of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregation or amyloid-beta 1-40 aggregation as specific, nonspecific, colloidal or non-interacting. We also demonstrate the ability of IMS–MS to screen for inhibitory small molecules in a 96-well plate format and use this to discover a new inhibitor of hIAPP amyloid assembly. A method for rapidly screening small-molecule inhibitors of amyloid assembly has been developed. This method uses electrospray ionization–ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry to detect and identify the type of inhibition. A screen of this nature could help in the discovery of therapeutics for numerous diseases associated with aberrant protein aggregation.

Title: 
Metal-free binding and coupling of carbon monoxide at a boron–boron triple bond

Many metal-containing compounds, and some metal-free compounds, will bind carbon monoxide. However, only a handful of metal-containing compounds have been shown to induce the coupling of two or more CO molecules, potentially a method for the use of CO as a one-carbon-atom building block for the synthesis of organic molecules. In this work, CO was added to a boron–boron triple bond at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, resulting in a compound into which four equivalents of CO are incorporated: a flat, bicyclic, bis(boralactone). By the controlled addition of one CO to the diboryne compound, an intermediate in the CO coupling reaction was isolated and structurally characterized. Electrochemical measurements confirm the strongly reducing nature of the diboryne compound. The coupling of carbon monoxide molecules is an attractive prospect for organic synthesis, but only a few metal complexes are known to do this. A compound containing a boron–boron triple bond has now been shown to induce the coupling of four CO molecules, through an intermediate with a single CO.

Title: 
Carbon–sulfur bond-forming reaction catalysed by the radical SAM enzyme HydE

Carbon–sulfur bond formation at aliphatic positions is a challenging reaction that is performed efficiently by radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzymes. Here we report that 1,3-thiazolidines can act as ligands and substrates for the radical SAM enzyme HydE, which is involved in the assembly of the active site of [FeFe]-hydrogenase. Using X-ray crystallography, in vitro assays and NMR spectroscopy we identified a radical-based reaction mechanism that is best described as the formation of a C-centred radical that concomitantly attacks the sulfur atom of a thioether. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a radical SAM enzyme that reacts directly on a sulfur atom instead of abstracting a hydrogen atom. Using theoretical calculations based on our high-resolution structures we followed the evolution of the electronic structure from SAM through to the formation of S-adenosyl-L-cysteine. Our results suggest that, at least in this case, the widely proposed and highly reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical species that triggers the reaction in radical SAM enzymes is not an isolable intermediate. L-Cysteine-derived thiazolidines have now been shown to be artificial substrates of the radical SAM enzyme HydE, which converts them into S-adenosyl-L-cysteine. Carbon–sulfur bonds are formed in a concerted mechanism that involves the formation of a C-centred radical that concomitantly attacks the S atom of a thioether. This is the first example of a radical SAM enzyme that reacts directly on a sulfur atom instead of abstracting an H-atom.

Title: 
Isolation and characterization of a uranium(VI)–nitride triple bond

The nature and extent of covalency in uranium bonding is still unclear compared with that of transition metals, and there is great interest in studying uranium–ligand multiple bonds. Although U=O and U=NR double bonds (where R is an alkyl group) are well-known analogues to transition-metal oxo and imido complexes, the uranium(VI)–nitride triple bond has long remained a synthetic target in actinide chemistry. Here, we report the preparation of a uranium(VI)–nitride triple bond. We highlight the importance of (1) ancillary ligand design, (2) employing mild redox reactions instead of harsh photochemical methods that decompose transiently formed uranium(VI) nitrides, (3) an electrostatically stabilizing sodium ion during nitride installation, (4) selecting the right sodium sequestering reagent, (5) inner versus outer sphere oxidation and (6) stability with respect to the uranium oxidation state. Computational analyses suggest covalent contributions to U≡N triple bonds that are surprisingly comparable to those of their group 6 transition-metal nitride counterparts. A terminal uranium(VI)–nitride has been shown to be accessible and isolable by a redox strategy whereas a photochemical approach resulted in decomposition. Computational analyses suggest that the U≡N triple bonds are surprisingly comparable to analogous group 6 transition metal nitrides, with a covalent character dominated by 5f rather than 6d contributions.

Title: 
Sub-ångström-resolution crystallography reveals physical distortions that enhance reactivity of a covalent enzymatic intermediate

It is recognized widely that enzymes promote reactions by providing a pathway that proceeds through a transition state of lower energy. In principle, further rate enhancements could be achieved if intermediates are prevented from relaxing to their lowest energy state, and thereby reduce the barrier to the subsequent transition state. Here, we report sub-ångström-resolution crystal structures of genuine covalent reaction intermediates of transketolase. These structures reveal a pronounced out-of-plane distortion of over 20° for the covalent bond that links cofactor and substrate, and a specific elongation of the scissile substrate carbon–carbon bond (d&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1.6&nbsp;Å). To achieve these distortions, the protein's conformation appears to prevent relaxation of a substrate–cofactor intermediate. The results implicate a reduced barrier to the subsequent step that is consistent with an intermediate of raised energy and leads to a more efficient overall process. Structural analysis of the enzyme transketolase at sub-ångström resolution shows the existence of physically distorted covalent intermediates with elongated scissile substrate bonds. These observations highlight the ability of enzymes to enhance the reactivity of reaction intermediates leading to a more efficient process.

Vibronically coherent ultrafast triplet-pair formation and subsequent thermally activated dissociation control efficient endothermic singlet fission

Singlet exciton fission (SF), the conversion of one spin-singlet exciton (S1) into two spin-triplet excitons (T1), could provide a means to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit in photovoltaics. SF as measured by the decay of S1 has been shown to occur efficiently and independently of temperature, even when the energy of S1 is as much as 200 meV less than that of 2T1. Here we study films of triisopropylsilyltetracene using transient optical spectroscopy and show that the triplet pair state (TT), which has been proposed to mediate singlet fission, forms on ultrafast timescales (in 300 fs) and that its formation is mediated by the strong coupling of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. This is followed by a slower loss of singlet character as the excitation evolves to become only TT. We observe the TT to be thermally dissociated on 10–100 ns timescales to form free triplets. This provides a model for ‘temperature-independent’ efficient TT formation and thermally activated TT separation. Singlet fission — the conversion of one singlet exciton into two triplet excitons, could improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices — but its mechanism is still to be fully understood. Now, in films of TIPS-tetracene, it has been shown that the formation of the triplet pair state, which has been proposed to mediate singlet fission, is ultrafast and vibronically coherent in this endothermic fission system.

A backbone lever-arm effect enhances polymer mechanochemistry

Mechanical forces along a polymer backbone can be used to bring about remarkable reactivity in embedded mechanically active functional groups, but little attention has been paid to how a given polymer backbone delivers that force to the reactant. Here, single-molecule force spectroscopy was used to directly quantify and compare the forces associated with the ring opening of gem-dibromo and gem-dichlorocyclopropanes affixed along the backbone of cis-polynorbornene and cis-polybutadiene. The critical force for isomerization drops by about one-third in the polynorbornene scaffold relative to polybutadiene. The root of the effect lies in more efficient chemomechanical coupling through the polynorbornene backbone, which acts as a phenomenological lever with greater mechanical advantage than polybutadiene. The experimental results are supported computationally and provide the foundation for a new strategy by which to engineer mechanochemical reactivity. Polymer mechanochemistry can trigger a wide range of often unanticipated reactivity, but the focus of these systems typically falls on the structure of the mechanophore rather than the intervening polymer backbone. Now, it has been shown that a poly(norbornene) backbone has a substantial impact on a mechanochemical ring-opening reaction, despite having only a minor effect on the force-free reaction.

Title: 
Translational, rotational and vibrational relaxation dynamics of a solute molecule in a non-interacting solvent

Spectroscopically observing the translational and rotational motion of solute molecules in liquid solutions is typically impeded by their interactions with the solvent, which conceal spectral detail through linewidth broadening. Here we show that unique insights into solute dynamics can be made with perfluorinated solvents, which interact weakly with solutes and provide a simplified liquid environment that helps to bridge the gap in our understanding of gas- and liquid-phase dynamics. Specifically, we show that in such solvents, the translational and rotational cooling of an energetic CN radical can be observed directly using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. We observe that translational-energy dissipation within these liquids can be modelled through a series of classic collisions, whereas classically simulated rotational-energy dissipation is shown to be distinctly faster than experimentally measured. We also observe the onset of rotational hindering from nearby solvent molecules, which arises as the average rotational energy of the solute falls below the effective barrier to rotation induced by the solvent. Spectral broadening generally conceals the signatures of rotational and translational motion in solution-phase spectra. Now, using highly inert perfluorocarbon solvents, spectral broadening has been minimized allowing the translational, rotational and vibrational relaxation dynamics of highly excited CN solute molecules to be observed simultaneously.

Title: 
Supramolecular nesting of cyclic polymers

Advances in template-directed synthesis make it possible to create artificial molecules with protein-like dimensions, directly from simple components. These synthetic macromolecules have a proclivity for self-organization that is reminiscent of biopolymers. Here, we report the synthesis of monodisperse cyclic porphyrin polymers, with diameters of up to 21 nm (750 C–C bonds). The ratio of the intrinsic viscosities for cyclic and linear topologies is 0.72, indicating that these polymers behave as almost ideal flexible chains in solution. When deposited on gold surfaces, the cyclic polymers display a new mode of two-dimensional supramolecular organization, combining encapsulation and nesting; one nanoring adopts a near-circular conformation, thus allowing a second nanoring to be captured within its perimeter, in a tightly folded conformation. Scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals that nesting occurs in combination with stacking when nanorings are deposited under vacuum, whereas when they are deposited directly from solution under ambient conditions there is stacking or nesting, but not a combination of both. Biopolymers adopt functional tertiary structures through folding and multiplex formation. Synthetic molecules with protein-like dimensions — monodisperse cyclic porphyrin polymers with diameters of 13–21 nm — have now been shown to exhibit biomimetic self-organization by forming nested structures on a gold surface. These assemblies are formed both under vacuum and during deposition from solution.

Title: 
A mitochondrial pathway for biosynthesis of lipid mediators

The central role of mitochondria in metabolic pathways and in cell-death mechanisms requires sophisticated signalling systems. Essential in this signalling process is an array of lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the molecular machinery for the production of oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids is localized in the cytosol and their biosynthesis has not been identified in mitochondria. Here we report that a range of diversified polyunsaturated molecular species derived from a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), is oxidized by the intermembrane-space haemoprotein, cytochrome c. We show that a number of oxygenated CL species undergo phospholipase A2-catalysed hydrolysis and thus generate multiple oxygenated fatty acids, including well-known lipid mediators. This represents a new biosynthetic pathway for lipid mediators. We demonstrate that this pathway, which includes the oxidation of polyunsaturated CLs and accumulation of their hydrolysis products (oxygenated linoleic, arachidonic acids and monolysocardiolipins), is activated in vivo after acute tissue injury. The biosynthesis of lipid mediators has not previously been identified in mitochondria. Here, polyunsaturated cardiolipins are shown to be oxidized in the mitochondria by cytochrome c. Subsequent hydrolysis of these oxygenated species generates a variety of oxygenated fatty acids as well as non-oxygenated and oxygenated lyso-cardiolipins. These reactions represent a new biosynthetic pathway for the production of lipid mediators.

Title: 
The promoting effect of adsorbed carbon monoxide on the oxidation of alcohols on a gold catalyst

In heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis, adsorbed carbon monoxide typically acts as a poison or poisoning intermediate in the oxidation of alcohols. However, gold as an (electro)catalyst often exhibits unexpected properties. Here we show that carbon monoxide irreversibly adsorbed on a Au(111) surface in aqueous alkaline media can act as a promoter for the electrocatalytic oxidation of certain alcohols, in particular methanol. In comparison with bare Au(111), the onset potential for methanol oxidation is significantly lower in the presence of adsorbed CO, and formation of the main methanol oxidation products—formaldehyde and formic acid—is enhanced. By studying the effect of adsorbed CO on the oxidation of other alcohols on gold, we conclude that the presence of adsorbed CO promotes beta-hydrogen elimination, that is, C–H bond breaking. Apart from its importance to gold catalysis, this is an unanticipated example of promotion effects by co-adsorbed small molecules in electrocatalysis. Adsorbed carbon monoxide typically acts to poison the oxidation of alcohols on heterogeneous catalysts and electrocatalysts. Here, it is shown that carbon monoxide that has been adsorbed irreversibly on a Au(111) surface can act as a promoter for this process by enhancing the scission of C–H bonds in the alcohol to yield the corresponding aldehyde.

Chemoselective conversion of biologically sourced polyols into chiral synthons

Crude oil currently provides much of the world's energy, but it is also the source of many feedstock chemicals. Methodology for the conversion of biomass into useful chemicals has often focused on either complete deoxygenation or the production of high-volume platform chemicals. Here, we describe the chemoselective partial reduction of silyl-protected C6O6-derived polyols to produce a diverse set of oxygen-functionalized chiral synthons. The combination of B(C6F5)3 and a tertiary silane efficiently generates a reactive equivalent of an electrophilic silylium ion (R3Si+) and a hydride (H−) reducing agent. The mechanism of oxygen loss does not involve a dehydrative elimination and thus avoids ablation of stereochemistry. Neighbouring group participation and the formation of cyclic intermediates is key to achieving selectivity in these reactions and, where both primary and secondary C–O bonds are present, the mechanism allows further control. The method provides—in one or two synthetic steps—highly improved syntheses of many C6On synthons as well as several previously undescribed products. Biorenewable carbohydrate feedstocks can be efficiently converted into a diverse set of oxygen-functionalized chiral synthons using a combination of a tertiary silane and the catalyst B(C6F5)3. The deoxygenation mechanism involves cyclic intermediates, which provide a means of controlling chemo- and diastereoselectivity.

Title: 
Cell-sized asymmetric lipid vesicles facilitate the investigation of asymmetric membranes

Asymmetric lipid giant vesicles have been used to model the biochemical reactions in cell membranes. However, methods for producing asymmetric giant vesicles lead to the inclusion of an organic solvent layer that affects the mechanical and physical characteristics of the membrane. Here we describe the formation of asymmetric giant vesicles that include little organic solvent, and use them to investigate the dynamic responses of lipid molecules in the vesicle membrane. We formed the giant vesicles via the inhomogeneous break-up of a lipid microtube generated by applying a jet flow to an asymmetric planar lipid bilayer. The asymmetric giant vesicles showed a lipid flip-flop behaviour in the membrane, superficially similar to the lipid flip-flop activity observed in apoptotic cells. In vitro synthesis of membrane proteins into the asymmetric giant vesicles revealed that the lipid asymmetry in bilayer membranes improves the reconstitution ratio of membrane proteins. Our asymmetric giant vesicles will be useful in elucidating lipid–lipid and lipid–membrane protein interactions involved in the regulation of cellular functions. Cell-sized asymmetric giant lipid vesicles containing a very small amount of organic solvent have now been formed via inhomogeneous break-up of a lipid microtube that was generated by applying a jet flow to an asymmetric planar lipid bilayer. The asymmetric giant vesicles were used to investigate the dynamic responses of lipid molecules and the effect of asymmetry on biochemical reactions.

Enzyme-free translation of DNA into sequence-defined synthetic polymers structurally unrelated to nucleic acids

The translation of DNA sequences into corresponding biopolymers enables the production, function and evolution of the macromolecules of life. In contrast, methods to generate sequence-defined synthetic polymers with similar levels of control have remained elusive. Here, we report the development of a DNA-templated translation system that enables the enzyme-free translation of DNA templates into sequence-defined synthetic polymers that have no necessary structural relationship with nucleic acids. We demonstrate the efficiency, sequence-specificity and generality of this translation system by oligomerizing building blocks including polyethylene glycol, α-(D)-peptides, and β-peptides in a DNA-programmed manner. Sequence-defined synthetic polymers with molecular weights of 26&nbsp;kDa containing 16 consecutively coupled building blocks and 90 densely functionalized β-amino acid residues were translated from DNA templates using this strategy. We integrated the DNA-templated translation system developed here into a complete cycle of translation, coding sequence replication, template regeneration and re-translation suitable for the iterated in vitro selection of functional sequence-defined synthetic polymers unrelated in structure to nucleic acids. An enzyme-free system that translates DNA into sequence-defined non-nucleic acid polymers including polyethylene glycol, α-(D)-peptides and β-peptides is described. Sequence-defined polymers with molecular weights of 26&nbsp;kDa containing 16 consecutively coupled building blocks and 90 densely functionalized β-amino acids were translated from DNA templates using this strategy.

5-Hydroxymethylcytosine is a predominantly stable DNA modification

5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) is an oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine which is present in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of most mammalian cells. Reduction of hmC levels in DNA is a hallmark of cancers. Elucidating the dynamics of this oxidation reaction and the lifetime of hmC in DNA is fundamental to understanding hmC function. Using stable isotope labelling of cytosine derivatives in the DNA of mammalian cells and ultrasensitive tandem liquid–chromatography mass spectrometry, we show that the majority of hmC is a stable modification, as opposed to a transient intermediate. In contrast with DNA methylation, which occurs immediately during replication, hmC forms slowly during the first 30 hours following DNA synthesis. Isotopic labelling of DNA in mouse tissues confirmed the stability of hmC in vivo and demonstrated a relationship between global levels of hmC and cell proliferation. These insights have important implications for understanding the states of chemically modified DNA bases in health and disease. Reduction of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) levels in DNA often occurs in cancers. Using isotope tracing experiments, this epigenetic DNA modification, which was thought to be an intermediate of demethylation, is now shown to be stable. A delay in the generation of hmC on newly synthesized DNA is responsible for the reduction of hmC levels in cancers.

Macromolecular metamorphosis via stimulus-induced transformations of polymer architecture

Macromolecular architecture plays a pivotal role in determining the properties of polymers. When designing polymers for specific applications, it is not only the size of a macromolecule that must be considered, but also its shape. In most cases, the topology of a polymer is a static feature that is inalterable once synthesized. Using reversible-covalent chemistry to prompt the disconnection of chemical bonds and the formation of new linkages in situ, we report polymers that undergo dramatic topological transformations via a process we term macromolecular metamorphosis. Utilizing this technique, a linear amphiphilic block copolymer or hyperbranched polymer undergoes ‘metamorphosis’ into comb, star and hydrophobic block copolymer architectures. This approach was extended to include a macroscopic gel which transitioned from a densely and covalently crosslinked network to one with larger distances between the covalent crosslinks when heated. These architectural transformations present an entirely new approach to ‘smart’ materials. Many properties of polymers are dictated by topology. However, the topology of a macromolecule is typically a static feature after synthesis. Now, an approach to dynamic and transformable macromolecular architecture has been developed. When triggered by an external stimulus, macromolecular topology can be triggered to transform via thermodynamic control.

Revealing the stereospecific chemistry of the reaction of Cl with aligned CHD3(ν1 = 1)

The concept of geometrical constraints and steric hindrance in reactions is implanted deeply in a chemist's ‘chemical intuition’. However, until now a true three-dimensional view of these steric effects has not been realized experimentally for any chemical reaction in full. Here we report the complete three-dimensional characterization of the sterics of a benchmark polyatomic reaction by measuring the dependence of the product state-resolved angular distributions on the spatial alignment of the reactive bond in a crossed molecular beam experiment. The results prove the existence of two distinct microscopic reaction mechanisms. Detailed analysis reveals that the origin of the stereodynamics in the HCl(ν&nbsp;=&nbsp;0)&nbsp;+&nbsp;CD3(00) product channel can be captured by a textbook line-of-centres collision model. In contrast, a time-delay pathway, which includes a sharp switch from in-plane to out-of-plane scattering in the forwards direction, appears to be operative in forming the excited HCl(ν&nbsp;=&nbsp;1)&nbsp;+&nbsp;CD3(00) product pair. Steric effects are a key concept for understanding chemical reactivity. Now, by aligning reactants through control of the polarization of the infrared laser in a crossed-beam experiment, a three-dimensional view of how a reaction proceeds is reported. The results show striking dependences on the direction from which the laser-aligned reagents approach.

Switchable selectivity in an NHC-catalysed dearomatizing annulation reaction

The development of general catalytic methods for the regio- and stereoselective construction of chiral N-heterocycles in a diversity-oriented fashion remains a formidable challenge in organic synthesis. N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has been shown to produce a variety of outcomes, but control of the reactivity has rarely been demonstrated. Here we report a switchable catalytic activation of enals with aromatic azomethine imines that provides high selectivity using NHC organocatalysts. The original selectivity corresponds to the acidity of the base used in the reaction. The catalytically generated chiral homoenolate or enol intermediate undergoes enantioselective annulation with electrophiles such as N-iminoquinolinium ylides, N-iminoisoquinolinium ylides and β-N-iminocarboline ylides. The good-to-high overall yields, high regioselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities observed are controlled by the catalyst and reaction conditions. Catalysis with N-heterocyclic carbenes produces diverse outcomes depending on which of the many possible reaction mechanisms dominates. Control of this reactivity within a single reaction type has rarely been demonstrated. Now, starting from identical substrates, a switchable catalytic activation is shown to afford different products with high regio- and stereoselectivity.

Molecular engineering of a cobalt-based electrocatalytic nanomaterial for H2 evolution under fully aqueous conditions

The viability of a hydrogen economy depends on the design of efficient catalytic systems based on earth-abundant elements. Innovative breakthroughs for hydrogen evolution based on molecular tetraimine cobalt compounds have appeared in the past decade. Here we show that such a diimine–dioxime cobalt catalyst can be grafted to the surface of a carbon nanotube electrode. The resulting electrocatalytic cathode material mediates H2 generation (55,000 turnovers in seven hours) from fully aqueous solutions at low-to-medium overpotentials. This material is remarkably stable, which allows extensive cycling with preservation of the grafted molecular complex, as shown by electrochemical studies, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. This clearly indicates that grafting provides an increased stability to these cobalt catalysts, and suggests the possible application of these materials in the development of technological devices. Efficient hydrogen-evolving catalysts comprising readily available elements are needed if hydrogen is to be adopted as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. Now, a diimine–dioxime cobalt complex has been covalently attached to a carbon nanotube electrode to yield an active and robust electrocatalyst for hydrogen generation (55,000 turnovers in seven hours) from aqueous solutions.

Interface control by chemical and dimensional matching in an oxide heterostructure

Interfaces between different materials underpin both new scientific phenomena, such as the emergent behaviour at oxide interfaces, and key technologies, such as that of the transistor. Control of the interfaces between materials with the same crystal structures but different chemical compositions is possible in many materials classes, but less progress has been made for oxide materials with different crystal structures. We show that dynamical self-organization during growth can create a coherent interface between the perovskite and fluorite oxide structures, which are based on different structural motifs, if an appropriate choice of cations is made to enable this restructuring. The integration of calculation with experimental observation reveals that the interface differs from both the bulk components and identifies the chemical bonding requirements to connect distinct oxide structures. The behaviour of heterostructures, crucial in nanodevices, largely depends on interfacial phenomena. These have proven difficult to control when the different materials adopt distinct crystal structures. Now, a coherent interface between perovskite and fluorite has been achieved that relies in particular on the coordination flexibility of judiciously chosen metal cations.

A nanoporous two-dimensional polymer by single-crystal-to-single-crystal photopolymerization

In contrast to the wide number and variety of available synthetic routes to conventional linear polymers, the synthesis of two-dimensional polymers and unambiguous proof of their structure remains a challenge. Two-dimensional polymers—single-layered polymers that form a tiling network in exactly two dimensions—have potential for use in nanoporous membranes and other applications. Here, we report the preparation of a fluorinated hydrocarbon two-dimensional polymer that can be exfoliated into single sheets, and its characterization by high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The procedure involves three steps: preorganization in a lamellar crystal of a rigid monomer bearing three photoreactive arms, photopolymerization of the crystalline monomers by [4 + 4] cycloaddition, and isolation of individual two-dimensional polymer sheets. This polymer is a molecularly thin (~1 nm) material that combines precisely defined monodisperse pores of ~9 Å with a high pore density of 3.3 × 1013 pores cm−2. Atomic-resolution single-crystal X-ray structures of the monomer, an intermediate dimer and the final crystalline two-dimensional polymer were obtained and prove the single-crystal-to-single-crystal nature and molecular precision of the two-dimensional photopolymerization. Two-dimensional synthetic polymers can be produced through solid-state topochemical polymerization, but achieving this through a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation has not yet been demonstrated. Now, a fluorinated Y-shaped monomer has been preorganized in a lamellar crystal, which goes through two successive single-crystal-to-single-crystal phototransformations to give a 2D polymer; single-crystal X-ray diffraction has been used to elucidate its structure.

Activation and discovery of earth-abundant metal catalysts using sodium tert-butoxide

First-row, earth-abundant metals offer an inexpensive and sustainable alternative to precious-metal catalysts. As such, iron and cobalt catalysts have garnered interest as replacements for alkene and alkyne hydrofunctionalization reactions. However, these have required the use of air- and moisture-sensitive catalysts and reagents, limiting both adoption by the non-expert as well as applicability, particularly in industrial settings. Here, we report a simple method for the use of earth-abundant metal catalysts by general activation with sodium tert-butoxide. Using only robust air- and moisture-stable reagents and pre-catalysts, both known and, significantly, novel catalytic activities have been successfully achieved, covering hydrosilylation, hydroboration, hydrovinylation, hydrogenation and [2π+2π] alkene cycloaddition. This activation method allows for the easy use of earth-abundant metals, including iron, cobalt, nickel and manganese, and represents a generic platform for the discovery and application of non-precious metal catalysis. NaOtBu — an alkoxide salt — enables simple access to low-oxidation-state catalysis using sustainable first-row transition metals (Fe, Co, Mn, Ni). The approach works across a wide range of reductive alkene and alkyne functionlization reactions including hydroboration, hydrosilylation, hydrogenation, hydrovinylation and [2π+2π] cyclization reactions.

A threading receptor for polysaccharides

Cellulose, chitin and related polysaccharides are key renewable sources of organic molecules and materials. However, poor solubility tends to hamper their exploitation. Synthetic receptors could aid dissolution provided they are capable of cooperative action, for example by multiple threading on a single polysaccharide molecule. Here we report a synthetic receptor designed to form threaded complexes (polypseudorotaxanes) with these natural polymers. The receptor binds fragments of the polysaccharides in aqueous solution with high affinities (Ka up to 19,000 M−1), and is shown—by nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy—to adopt the threading geometry. Evidence from induced circular dichroism and atomic force microscopy implies that the receptor also forms polypseudorotaxanes with cellulose and its polycationic analogue chitosan. The results hold promise for polysaccharide solubilization under mild conditions, as well as for new approaches to the design of biologically active molecules. A synthetic receptor has been designed to form pseudorotaxanes and polypseudorotaxanes with oligo/polysaccharides in water. Target substrates have all-equatorial substitution patterns, and include cellulose, cellodextrins and the cationic polysaccharide chitosan. The results suggest an approach to dissolving these polysaccharides under mild conditions and could prove useful for processing these abundant renewable resources.

State-resolved diffraction oscillations imaged for inelastic collisions of NO radicals with He, Ne and Ar

Just as light scattering from an object results in diffraction patterns, the quantum mechanical nature of molecules can lead to the diffraction of matter waves during molecular collisions. This behaviour manifests itself as rapid oscillatory structures in measured differential cross-sections, and such observable features are sensitive probes of molecular interaction potentials. However, these structures have proved challenging to resolve experimentally. Here, we use a Stark decelerator to form a beam of state-selected and velocity-controlled NO radicals and measure state-to-state differential cross-sections for inelastic collisions of NO with He, Ne and Ar atoms using velocity map imaging. The monochromatic velocity distribution of the NO beam produced scattering images with unprecedented sharpness and angular resolution, thereby fully resolving quantum diffraction oscillations. We found excellent agreement with quantum close-coupling scattering calculations for these benchmark systems. When molecules collide with atoms or other molecules their quantum mechanical character can lead to the diffraction of matter waves. Making use of advances in molecular beam technology, such diffraction oscillations have now been observed with unprecedented sharpness and angular resolution in the benchmark NO&nbsp;+&nbsp;He, Ne, or Ar systems.

Title: 
From helical to planar chirality by on-surface chemistry

The chirality of molecular structures is paramount in many phenomena, including enantioselective reactions, molecular self-assembly, biological processes and light or electron-spin polarization. Flat prochiral molecules, which are achiral in the gas phase or solution, can exhibit adsorption-induced chirality when deposited on surfaces. The whole array of such molecular adsorbates is naturally racemic as spontaneous global mirror-symmetry breaking is disfavoured. Here we demonstrate a chemical method of obtaining flat prochiral molecules adsorbed on the solid achiral surface in such a way that a specific adsorbate handedness globally dominates. An optically pure helical precursor is flattened in a cascade of on-surface reactions, which enables chirality transfer. The individual reaction products are identified by high-resolution scanning-probe microscopy. The ultimate formation of globally non-racemic assemblies of flat molecules through stereocontrolled on-surface synthesis allows for chirality to be expressed in as yet unexplored types of organic–inorganic chiral interfaces. Flat, prochiral molecules form chiral adsorbates on achiral surfaces, but such assemblies are globally racemic. Now, it is shown that this mirror symmetry can be broken through stereocontrolled on-surface synthesis. Enantiopure helicene molecules can be transformed into flat, enantiofacially adsorbed products through a cascade of reactions on Ag(111) monitored by high-resolution scanning probe microscopy.

Title: 
A decarboxylative approach for regioselective hydroarylation of alkynes

Regioselective activation of aromatic C–H bonds is a long-standing challenge for arene functionalization reactions such as the hydroarylation of alkynes. One possible solution is to employ a removable directing group that activates one of several aromatic C–H bonds. Here we report a new catalytic method for regioselective alkyne hydroarylation with benzoic acid derivatives during which the carboxylate functionality directs the alkyne to the ortho-C–H bond with elimination in situ to form a vinylarene product. The decarboxylation stage of this tandem sequence is envisioned to proceed with the assistance of an ortho-alkenyl moiety, which is formed by the initial alkyne coupling. This ruthenium-catalysed decarboxylative alkyne hydroarylation eliminates the common need for pre-existing ortho-substitution on benzoic acids for substrate activation, proceeds under redox-neutral and relatively mild conditions, and tolerates a broad range of synthetically useful aromatic functionality. Thus, it significantly increases the synthetic utility of benzoic acids as easily accessible aromatic building blocks. Achieving high regioselectivity in hydroarylation of alkynes has been a long-standing challenge. Now, a ruthenium-catalysed decarboxylative alkyne hydroarylation with broad substrate scope, high chemo- and stereoselectivity, as well as controlled and versatile regiochemistry, is described.

Bulk protonic conductivity in a cephalopod structural protein

Proton-conducting materials play a central role in many renewable energy and bioelectronics technologies, including fuel cells, batteries and sensors. Thus, much research effort has been expended to develop improved proton-conducting materials, such as ceramic oxides, solid acids, polymers and metal–organic frameworks. Within this context, bulk proton conductors from naturally occurring proteins have received somewhat less attention than other materials, which is surprising given the potential modularity, tunability and processability of protein-based materials. Here, we report proton conductivity for thin films composed of reflectin, a cephalopod structural protein. Bulk reflectin has a proton conductivity of ~2.6&nbsp;×&nbsp;10–3&nbsp;S&nbsp;cm–1 at 65&nbsp;°C, a proton transport activation energy of ~0.2 eV and a proton mobility of ~7&nbsp;×&nbsp;10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1. These figures of merit are similar to those reported for state-of-the-art artificial proton conductors and make it possible to use reflectin in protein-based protonic transistors. Our findings may hold implications for the next generation of biocompatible proton-conducting materials and protonic devices. Proton-conducting materials have proved useful for renewable energy applications and bioelectronics technologies. The proton conductivity of thin films made from reflectin — a cephalopod structural protein — is now reported. Reflectin's electrical properties compare favourably to those of artificial materials, and have enabled the demonstration of protein-based protonic transistors.

A 31-residue peptide induces aggregation of tau's microtubule-binding region in cells

The self-propagation of misfolded conformations of tau underlies neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's. There is considerable interest in discovering the minimal sequence and active conformational nucleus that defines this self-propagating event. The microtubule-binding region, spanning residues 244–372, reproduces much of the aggregation behaviour of tau in cells and animal models. Further dissection of the amyloid-forming region to a hexapeptide from the third microtubule-binding repeat resulted in a peptide that rapidly forms fibrils in vitro. We show that this peptide lacks the ability to seed aggregation of tau244–372 in cells. However, as the hexapeptide is gradually extended to 31 residues, the peptides aggregate more slowly and gain potent activity to induce aggregation of tau244–372 in cells. X-ray fibre diffraction, hydrogen–deuterium exchange and solid-state NMR studies map the beta-forming region to a 25-residue sequence. Thus, the nucleus for self-propagating aggregation of tau244–372 in cells is packaged in a remarkably small peptide. The self-propagation of misfolded conformations of tau occurs in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. The microtubule-binding region, tau244-372, reproduces much of the aggregation behaviour of tau in cells and animal models. Now, it has been shown that a 31-residue peptide from tau's R3 domain forms a cross-β conformation that efficiently seeds aggregation of tau244-372 in cells.

In situ quantitative imaging of cellular lipids using molecular sensors

Membrane lipids are dynamic molecules that play important roles in cell signalling and regulation, but an in situ imaging method for quantitatively tracking lipids in living cells is lacking at present. Here, we report a new chemical method of quantitative lipid imaging using sensors engineered by labelling proteins with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore. A prototype sensor for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)—a key signalling lipid in diverse cellular processes—was generated by covalently attaching a single 2-dimethylamino-6-acyl-naphthalene group to the N-terminal α-helix of the engineered epsin1 ENTH domain, a protein that selectively binds PtdIns(4,5)P2. The sensor allows robust and sensitive in situ quantitative imaging in mammalian cells, providing new insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics and fluctuation of this key signalling lipid. Application of the sensor to immune cells reveals the presence of a local threshold PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentration required for triggering phagocytosis. This sensor strategy is generally applicable to in situ quantification of other cellular lipids. Cellular membrane lipids play key roles in cell regulation. Here, an environmentally sensitive fluorophore is attached to a protein that binds to a key signalling lipid to produce a membrane lipid sensor. This strategy allows sensitive, quantitative, spatiotemporal imaging of the lipid concentration in mammalian cells.

Sequence-defined bioactive macrocycles via an acid-catalysed cascade reaction

Synthetic macrocycles derived from sequence-defined oligomers are a unique structural class whose ring size, sequence and structure can be tuned via precise organization of the primary sequence. Similar to peptides and other peptidomimetics, these well-defined synthetic macromolecules become pharmacologically relevant when bioactive side chains are incorporated into their primary sequence. In this article, we report the synthesis of oligothioetheramide (oligoTEA) macrocycles via a one-pot acid-catalysed cascade reaction. The versatility of the cyclization chemistry and modularity of the assembly process was demonstrated via the synthesis of &gt;20 diverse oligoTEA macrocycles. Structural characterization via NMR spectroscopy revealed the presence of conformational isomers, which enabled the determination of local chain dynamics within the macromolecular structure. Finally, we demonstrate the biological activity of oligoTEA macrocycles designed to mimic facially amphiphilic antimicrobial peptides. The preliminary results indicate that macrocyclic oligoTEAs with just two-to-three cationic charge centres can elicit potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Macrocyclic oligomers are a unique structural class of compounds in which the ring size and structure can be tuned through the precise control of the primary sequence. Now, it has been shown that oligothioetheramide (oligoTEA) macrocycles can be synthesized using a one-pot acid-catalysed cascade reaction. Preliminary results indicate that cationic oligoTEAs are promising bactericidal agents.

A labile hydride strategy for the synthesis of heavily nitridized BaTiO3

Oxynitrides have been explored extensively in the past decade because of their interesting properties, such as visible-light absorption, photocatalytic activity and high dielectric permittivity. Their synthesis typically requires high-temperature NH3 treatment (800–1,300 °C) of precursors, such as oxides, but the highly reducing conditions and the low mobility of N3− species in the lattice place significant constraints on the composition and structure—and hence the properties—of the resulting oxynitrides. Here we show a topochemical route that enables the preparation of an oxynitride at low temperatures (&lt;500 °C), using a perovskite oxyhydride as a host. The lability of H− in BaTiO3−xHx (x ≤ 0.6) allows H−/N3− exchange to occur, and yields a room-temperature ferroelectric BaTiO3−xN2x/3. This anion exchange is accompanied by a metal-to-insulator crossover via mixed O–H–N intermediates. These findings suggest that this ‘labile hydride’ strategy can be used to explore various oxynitrides, and perhaps other mixed anionic compounds. Oxynitrides are garnering interest because of their variety of novel properties, but their synthesis has typically involved highly reducing conditions that put significant constraints on their composition, structure and properties. Now, the lability of H− in perovskite oxyhydride BaTiO3−xHx has enabled H–/N3– exchange at a lower temperature, yielding a ferroelectric oxynitride BaTiO3−xN2x/3.

Title: 
The Janus-faced role of external forces in mechanochemical disulfide bond cleavage

Recent force microscopy measurements on the mechanically activated cleavage of a protein disulfide bond through reaction with hydroxide ions revealed that for forces greater than 0.5&nbsp;nN, the acceleration of the reaction rate is substantially reduced. Here, using ab initio simulations, we trace this ‘reactivity switch’ back to a dual role played by the mechanical force, which leads to antagonistic effects. On the one hand, the force performs work on the system, and thereby accelerates the reaction. On the other hand, the force also induces a conformational distortion that involves the S–S–C–C dihedral angle, which drives the disulfide into a conformation that is shielded against nucleophilic attack because of steric hindrance. The discovery of force-induced conformational changes that steer chemical reactivity provides a new key concept that is expected to be relevant beyond this specific case, for example in understanding how ‘disulfide switches’ regulate protein function and for the rational design of mechanoresponsive materials. Using ab initio simulations external mechanical forces are shown to trigger structural changes to disulfide bridges that result in conformations that are less susceptible to nucleophilic attack. This finding is crucial for the interpretation of recent force microscopy experiments, and could be important for understanding protein regulation.

Ab initio carbon capture in open-site metal–organic frameworks

During the formation of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), metal centres can coordinate with the intended organic linkers, but also with solvent molecules. In this case, subsequent activation by removal of the solvent molecules creates unsaturated ‘open’ metal sites known to have a strong affinity for CO2 molecules, but their interactions are still poorly understood. Common force fields typically underestimate by as much as two orders of magnitude the adsorption of CO2 in open-site Mg-MOF-74, which has emerged as a promising MOF for CO2 capture. Here we present a systematic procedure to generate force fields using high-level quantum chemical calculations. Monte Carlo simulations based on an ab initio force field generated for CO2 in Mg-MOF-74 shed some light on the interpretation of thermodynamic data from flue gas in this material. The force field describes accurately the chemistry of the open metal sites, and is transferable to other structures. This approach may serve in molecular simulations in general and in the study of fluid–solid interactions. Metal–organic frameworks featuring unsaturated metal sites have emerged as promising materials for CO2 capture, but the host–guest interactions at play have remained poorly understood. An approach based on quantum chemical calculations has now been devised to generate force fields that accurately describe a MOF's metal sites and predict its gas uptake abilities.

Cloud-based simulations on Google Exacycle reveal ligand modulation of GPCR activation pathways

Simulations can provide tremendous insight into the atomistic details of biological mechanisms, but micro- to millisecond timescales are historically only accessible on dedicated supercomputers. We demonstrate that cloud computing is a viable alternative that brings long-timescale processes within reach of a broader community. We used Google's Exacycle cloud-computing platform to simulate two milliseconds of dynamics of a major drug target, the G-protein-coupled receptor β2AR. Markov state models aggregate independent simulations into a single statistical model that is validated by previous computational and experimental results. Moreover, our models provide an atomistic description of the activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor and reveal multiple activation pathways. Agonists and inverse agonists interact differentially with these pathways, with profound implications for drug design. Two milliseconds of molecular dynamics simulations of a major drug-target G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) has been carried out using Google's Exacycle cloud computing platform. Markov state models were used to aggregate independent simulations into a statistical model that provides an atomistic description of GPCR ligand-modulated activation pathways.

Structure and biosynthesis of a macrocyclic peptide containing an unprecedented lysine-to-tryptophan crosslink

Streptococcal bacteria use peptide signals as a means of intraspecies communication. These peptides can contain unusual post-translational modifications, providing opportunities for expanding our understanding of nature's chemical and biosynthetic repertoires. Here, we have combined tools from natural products discovery and mechanistic enzymology to elucidate the structure and biosynthesis of streptide, a streptococcal macrocyclic peptide. We show that streptide bears an unprecedented post-translational modification involving a covalent linkage between two unactivated carbons within the side chains of lysine and tryptophan. The biosynthesis of streptide was addressed by genetic and biochemical studies. The former implicated a new SPASM-domain-containing radical SAM enzyme StrB, while the latter revealed that StrB contains two [4Fe–4S] clusters and installs the unusual lysine-to-tryptophan crosslink in a single step. By intramolecularly stitching together the side chains of lysine and tryptophan, StrB provides a new route for biosynthesizing macrocyclic peptides. Structural elucidation of a peptide natural product has revealed an unprecedented post-translational modification involving formation of a carbon–carbon bond between the side-chains of lysine and tryptophan. This motif defines a new family of cyclic peptides. Biochemical studies reveal that this C-C bond is generated by a radical SAM enzyme, and delineate its catalytic mechanism.

Electrostatically gated membrane permeability in inorganic protocells

Although several strategies are now available to produce functional microcompartments analogous to primitive cell-like structures, little progress has been made in generating protocell constructs with self-controlled membrane permeability. Here we describe the preparation of water-dispersible colloidosomes based on silica nanoparticles and delineated by a continuous semipermeable inorganic membrane capable of self-activated, electrostatically gated permeability. We use crosslinking and covalent grafting of a pH-responsive copolymer to generate an ultrathin elastic membrane that exhibits selective release and uptake of small molecules. This behaviour, which depends on the charge of the copolymer coronal layer, serves to trigger enzymatic dephosphorylation reactions specifically within the protocell aqueous interior. This system represents a step towards the design and construction of alternative types of artificial chemical cells and protocell models based on spontaneous processes of inorganic self-organization. Colloidosomes based on silica nanoparticles self-assembled at water droplet/oil interfaces are promising inorganic protocells, but they often leak small molecules on transfer into bulk water. Through silane crosslinking and copolymer grafting, colloidosomes have now been endowed with membranes that exhibit pH-responsive permeability to small molecules. The resulting water-dispersible colloidosomes further serve to host and control enzyme reactions.

Strongly coupled binuclear uranium–oxo complexes from uranyl oxo rearrangement and reductive silylation

The most common motif in uranium chemistry is the d0f0 uranyl ion [UO2]2+ in which the oxo groups are rigorously linear and inert. Alternative geometries, such as the cis-uranyl, have been identified theoretically and implicated in oxo-atom transfer reactions that are relevant to environmental speciation and nuclear waste remediation. Single electron reduction is now known to impart greater oxo-group reactivity, but with retention of the linear OUO motif, and reactions of the oxo groups to form new covalent bonds remain rare. Here, we describe the synthesis, structure, reactivity and magnetic properties of a binuclear uranium–oxo complex. Formed through a combination of reduction and oxo-silylation and migration from a trans to a cis position, the new butterfly-shaped Si–OUO2UO–Si molecule shows remarkably strong UV–UV coupling and chemical inertness, suggesting that this rearranged uranium oxo motif might exist for other actinide species in the environment, and have relevance to the aggregation of actinide oxide clusters. The oxo groups in the common trans-uranyl ion — present in the majority of known uranium compounds — are linear and inert. Now, a new reduced binuclear uranium–dioxo compound with very strong metal coupling and remarkable air stability has been formed through oxo migration and silylation.

Catalytic asymmetric trifluoromethylthiolation via enantioselective [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfonium ylides

The trifluoromethylthio (SCF3) functional group has been of increasing importance in drug design and development as a consequence of its unique electronic properties and high stability coupled with its high lipophilicity. As a result, methods to introduce this highly electronegative functional group have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Although significant progress has been made in the introduction of SCF3 functionality into a variety of molecules, there remain significant challenges regarding the enantioselective synthesis of SCF3-containing compounds. Here, an asymmetric trifluoromethylthiolation that proceeds through the enantioselective [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of a sulfonium ylide generated from a metal carbene and sulfide (Doyle–Kirmse reaction) has been developed using chiral Rh(II) and Cu(I) catalysts. This transformation features mild reaction conditions and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% yield and 98% e.e.), thus providing a unique, highly efficient and enantioselective method for the construction of C(sp3)–SCF3 bonds bearing chiral centres. The asymmetric Doyle–Kirmse reaction using chiral Rh(II)- or Cu(I)-catalysts provides SCF3-containing compounds in a highly efficient and enantioselective manner. The reaction proceeds through enantioselective formation of sulfonium ylide from a diazoester and allyl- or propargyl trifluoromethyl sulfide, followed by concerted [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement with the transfer of chirality from sulfur to carbon.

Remote C−H alkylation and C−C bond cleavage enabled by an in situ generated palladacycle

The direct and selective functionalization of C−H bonds of arenes is one of the most challenging yet valuable aims in organic synthesis. Despite notable recent achievements, a pre-installed directing group proved to be essential in most of the methodologies reported so far. In this context, the use of a transient directing group that can be generated in situ has attracted attention and demonstrated the great potential of this strategy. Here we report the use of an in situ generated palladacycle to accomplish remote-selective C−H alkylation reactions of arenes. Following the C−H functionalization event, the alkylated aryl ring undergoes a formal migration to provide diversely substituted benzofuran and indole scaffolds. Computational studies revealed that a palladium(IV) intermediate is not involved in the alkylation step. The aryl migration was found to proceed through a sequential C−C bond cleavage, insertion and β-hydride-elimination process. The increasing steric bulk that builds up during the C−H functionalization step drives the unusual C−C bond cleavage in a non-strained system. Existing methods for C–H activation depend on pre-installed directing groups, the removal of which poses a practical limitation on the use of these reactions in synthesis. Now, a remote-selective C−H alkylation reaction of arenes using an in situ generated spiropalladacycle has been shown to furnish benzofurans and indoles without the need for a directing group.

Integrated 3D-printed reactionware for chemical synthesis and analysis

Three-dimensional (3D) printing has the potential to transform science and technology by creating bespoke, low-cost appliances that previously required dedicated facilities to make. An attractive, but unexplored, application is to use a 3D printer to initiate chemical reactions by printing the reagents directly into a 3D reactionware matrix, and so put reactionware design, construction and operation under digital control. Here, using a low-cost 3D printer and open-source design software we produced reactionware for organic and inorganic synthesis, which included printed-in catalysts and other architectures with printed-in components for electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis. This enabled reactions to be monitored in situ so that different reactionware architectures could be screened for their efficacy for a given process, with a digital feedback mechanism for device optimization. Furthermore, solely by modifying reactionware architecture, reaction outcomes can be altered. Taken together, this approach constitutes a relatively cheap, automated and reconfigurable chemical discovery platform that makes techniques from chemical engineering accessible to typical synthetic laboratories. A low-cost 3D printer is used to combine chemical reactions and the reactor to produce an active ‘reactionware’ system for organic and inorganic synthesis. Active elements such as catalysts can be incorporated into the walls of printed reactors, and other printed-in components that enable electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis can also be included.

Experimental realization of two-dimensional boron sheets

A variety of two-dimensional materials have been reported in recent years, yet single-element systems such as graphene and black phosphorus have remained rare. Boron analogues have been predicted, as boron atoms possess a short covalent radius and the flexibility to adopt sp2 hybridization, features that favour the formation of two-dimensional allotropes, and one example of such a borophene material has been reported recently. Here, we present a parallel experimental work showing that two-dimensional boron sheets can be grown epitaxially on a Ag(111) substrate. Two types of boron sheet, a β12 sheet and a χ3 sheet, both exhibiting a triangular lattice but with different arrangements of periodic holes, are observed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Density functional theory simulations agree well with experiments, and indicate that both sheets are planar without obvious vertical undulations. The boron sheets are quite inert to oxidization and interact only weakly with their substrate. We envisage that such boron sheets may find applications in electronic devices in the future. A variety of two-dimensional materials have been reported in the past few years, yet single-element systems—such as graphene and black phosphorus—have remained rare. 2D allotropes of boron have long been predicted and recently investigated. Two boron sheets have now been grown on a Ag(111) surface by molecule beam epitaxy that exhibit significant chemical stability against oxidation.

Catalytic diastereo- and enantioselective additions of versatile allyl groups to N–H ketimines

There are many biologically active organic molecules that contain one or more nitrogen-containing moieties, and broadly applicable and efficient catalytic transformations that deliver them diastereoselectively and/or enantioselectively are much sought after. Various methods for enantioselective synthesis of α-secondary amines are available (for example, from additions to protected/activated aldimines), but those involving ketimines are much less common. There are no reported additions of carbon-based nucleophiles to unprotected/unactivated (or N–H) ketimines. Here, we report a catalytic, diastereo- and enantioselective three-component strategy for merging an N–H ketimine, a monosubstituted allene and B2(pin)2, affording products in up to 95% yield, &gt;98% diastereoselectivity and &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio. The utility of the approach is highlighted by synthesis of the tricyclic core of a class of compounds that have been shown to possess anti-Alzheimer activity. Stereochemical models developed with the aid of density functional theory calculations, which account for the observed trends and levels of enantioselectivity, are presented. Amines are commonly occurring units in many biologically active molecules. Now, a catalytic method has been developed that merges an unprotected/unactivated ketimine, a monosubstituted allene and a commercially available diboron reagent to afford versatile α-tertiary amines in up to 95% yield, &gt;98% diastereomeric ratio and &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio. The utility of this method was demonstrated through its application to the synthesis of the tricyclic core of a class of compounds with anti-Alzheimer activity.

A divergent approach to the synthesis of the yohimbinoid alkaloids venenatine and alstovenine

The yohimbinoid alkaloids continue to receive considerable attention from the synthetic community because of their interesting chemical structures and varied biological activity. Although there are several elegant syntheses of certain members of this group of alkaloids, a truly unified approach has yet to be developed. In short, general approaches to this compound class are hampered by a lack of complete control in setting the C(3) stereocentre at a late stage. Herein, we report that a functionalized hydrindanone enables a divergent strategy that builds on existing precedent to address this long-standing challenge. Utilizing an aminonitrile intermediate, the stereochemistry at C(3) of the yohimbinoid skeleton can be controlled effectively in a Pictet–Spengler reaction. We applied this approach to the first total syntheses of the C(3) epimeric natural products venenatine and alstovenine. A hydrindanone-based approach to yohimbinoid natural products has been developed. A judicious choice of reaction conditions — inspired by prior work by the Stork group — allows effective control of the stereochemistry at C3 of the yohimbinoid skeleton. This approach has resulted in the first total syntheses of the C3 epimeric natural products venenatine and alstovenine.

Supramolecular binding and separation of hydrocarbons within a functionalized porous metal–organic framework

Supramolecular interactions are fundamental to host–guest binding in many chemical and biological processes. Direct visualization of such supramolecular interactions within host–guest systems is extremely challenging, but crucial to understanding their function. We report a comprehensive study that combines neutron scattering, synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction, and computational modelling to define the detailed binding at a molecular level of acetylene, ethylene and ethane within the porous host NOTT-300. This study reveals simultaneous and cooperative hydrogen-bonding, π···π stacking interactions and intermolecular dipole interactions in the binding of acetylene and ethylene to give up to 12 individual weak supramolecular interactions aligned within the host to form an optimal geometry for the selective binding of hydrocarbons. We also report the cooperative binding of a mixture of acetylene and ethylene within the porous host, together with the corresponding breakthrough experiments and analysis of adsorption isotherms of gas mixtures. Gas sorption and separation in porous materials is dependent on the host–guest binding within any given system. Now, the molecular details of cooperative binding between small hydrocarbons and a metal–organic framework, NOTT-300, at multiple sites have been elucidated by complementary scattering and diffraction techniques. This material is also capable of separating C1 and C2 hydrocarbons under ambient conditions.

Catalyst recognition of cis-1,2-diols enables site-selective functionalization of complex molecules

Carbohydrates and natural products serve essential roles in nature, and also provide core scaffolds for pharmaceutical agents and vaccines. However, the inherent complexity of these molecules imposes significant synthetic hurdles for their selective functionalization and derivatization. Nature has, in part, addressed these issues by employing enzymes that are able to orient and activate substrates within a chiral pocket, which increases dramatically both the rate and selectivity of organic transformations. In this article we show that similar proximity effects can be utilized in the context of synthetic catalysts to achieve general and predictable site-selective functionalization of complex molecules. Unlike enzymes, our catalysts apply a single reversible covalent bond to recognize and bind to specific functional group displays within substrates. By combining this unique binding selectivity and asymmetric catalysis, we are able to modify the less reactive axial positions within monosaccharides and natural products. The manipulation of complex molecules offers an avenue for developing new therapeutics and biological probes. Here, a catalyst is described that forms a covalent bond to the substrate before selectively functionalizing a proximal functional group. Cis-1,2-diols are targeted allowing for the derivatization of the axial hydroxyls of monosaccharides in the presence of unprotected equatorial hydroxyls.

Catching elusive glycosyl cations in a condensed phase with HF/SbF5 superacid

Glycosyl cations are universally accepted key ionic intermediates in the mechanism of glycosylation, the reaction that covalently links carbohydrates to other molecules. These ions have remained hypothetical species so far because of their extremely short life in organic media as a consequence of their very high reactivity. Here, we report the use of liquid hydrofluoric acid–antimony pentafluoride (HF/SbF5) superacid to generate and stabilize the glycosyl cations derived from peracetylated 2-deoxy and 2-bromoglucopyranose in a condensed phase. Their persistence in this superacid medium allows their three-dimensional structure to be studied by NMR, aided by complementary computations. Their deuteration further confirms the impact of the structure of the glycosyl cation on the stereochemical outcome of its trapping. Glycosyl cations are universally accepted as key intermediates in the mechanism of glycosylation—the reaction that covalently links carbohydrates to other molecules—but their high reactivity makes them difficult to characterize. Using HF/SbF5 superacid, two glucosyl cations have been generated and stabilized, then characterized by NMR spectroscopy aided by computation and their conformation elucidated.

A thiamin-utilizing ribozyme decarboxylates a pyruvate-like substrate

Vitamins are hypothesized to be relics of an RNA world, and were probably participants in RNA-mediated primordial metabolism. If catalytic RNAs, or ribozymes, could harness vitamin cofactors to aid their function in a manner similar to protein enzymes, it would enable them to catalyse a much larger set of chemical reactions. The cofactor thiamin diphosphate, a derivative of vitamin B1 (thiamin), is used by enzymes to catalyse difficult metabolic reactions, including decarboxylation of stable α-keto acids such as pyruvate. Here, we report a ribozyme that uses free thiamin to decarboxylate a pyruvate-based suicide substrate (LnkPB). Thiamin conjugated to biotin was used to isolate catalytic individuals from a pool of random-sequence RNAs attached to LnkPB. Analysis of a stable guanosine adduct obtained via digestion of an RNA sequence (clone dc4) showed the expected decarboxylation product. The discovery of a prototypic thiamin-utilizing ribozyme has implications for the role of RNA in orchestrating early metabolic cycles. Vitamins are thought to be relics of a primordial RNA World. A demonstration that catalytic RNAs are capable of harnessing vitamin cofactors would support the likely role of vitamins in early metabolic processes. Here, a ribozyme that uses vitamin B1 to aid decarboxylation of a pyruvate-like substrate is reported.

Title: 
Identification of (S)-selective transaminases for the asymmetric synthesis of bulky chiral amines

The use of transaminases to access pharmaceutically relevant chiral amines is an attractive alternative to transition-metal-catalysed asymmetric chemical synthesis. However, one major challenge is their limited substrate scope. Here we report the creation of highly active and stereoselective transaminases starting from fold class I. The transaminases were developed by extensive protein engineering followed by optimization of the identified motif. The resulting enzymes exhibited up to 8,900-fold higher activity than the starting scaffold and are highly stereoselective (up to &gt;99.9% enantiomeric excess) in the asymmetric synthesis of a set of chiral amines bearing bulky substituents. These enzymes should therefore be suitable for use in the synthesis of a wide array of potential intermediates for pharmaceuticals. We also show that the motif can be engineered into other protein scaffolds with sequence identities as low as 70%, and as such should have a broad impact in the field of biocatalytic synthesis and enzyme engineering. A motif was identified in the scaffold of an (S)-selective transaminase that enables the asymmetric synthesis of bulky chiral amines. This motif is transferable to other enzymes with as low as 70% sequence identity. The biocatalysts developed show high stereoselectivity and their synthetic potential was confirmed in preparative scale synthesis.

Optically switchable transistor via energy-level phototuning in a bicomponent organic semiconductor

Organic semiconductors are suitable candidates for printable, flexible and large-area electronics. Alongside attaining an improved device performance, to confer a multifunctional nature to the employed materials is key for organic-based logic applications. Here we report on the engineering of an electronic structure in a semiconducting film by blending two molecular components, a photochromic diarylethene derivative and a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) matrix, to attain phototunable and bistable energy levels for the P3HT's hole transport. As a proof-of-concept we exploited this blend as a semiconducting material in organic thin-film transistors. The device illumination at defined wavelengths enabled reversible tuning of the diarylethene's electronic states in the blend, which resulted in modulation of the output current. The device photoresponse was found to be in the microsecond range, and thus on a technologically relevant timescale. This modular blending approach allows for the convenient incorporation of various molecular components, which opens up perspectives on multifunctional devices and logic circuits. One of the goals for devices using organic semiconductors is to make the materials themselves multifunctional or tunable, reducing the complexity of the device. Now, a film created by blending two components is shown to be phototunable with bistable energy levels and has been used in an organic thin-film transistor.

Direct mapping of the angle-dependent barrier to reaction for Cl + CHD3 using polarized scattering data

The transition state, which gates and modulates reactive flux, serves as the central concept in our understanding of activated reactions. The barrier height of the transition state can be estimated from the activation energy taken from thermal kinetics data or from the energetic threshold in the measured excitation function (the dependence of reaction cross-sections on initial collision energies). However, another critical and equally important property, the angle-dependent barrier to reaction, has not yet been amenable to experimental determination until now. Here, using the benchmark reaction of Cl + CHD3(v1 = 1) as an example, we show how to map this anisotropic property of the transition state as a function of collision energy from the preferred reactant bond alignment of the backward-scattered products—the imprints of small impact-parameter collisions. The deduced bend potential at the transition state agrees with ab initio calculations. We expect that the method should be applicable to many other direct reactions with a collinear barrier. Two important properties in an activated chemical reaction are the barrier height and its geometrical dependence. Now, a method has been developed to directly map the angle-dependent barrier to reaction from polarized scattering data for the Cl + CHD3 reaction. The method should be applicable to many other direct reactions with a colinear barrier.

Redox-inactive metal ions modulate the reactivity and oxygen release of mononuclear non-haem iron(III)–peroxo complexes

Redox-inactive metal ions that function as Lewis acids play pivotal roles in modulating the reactivity of oxygen-containing metal complexes and metalloenzymes, such as the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II and its small-molecule mimics. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of non-haem iron(III)–peroxo complexes that bind redox-inactive metal ions, (TMC)FeIII–(μ,η2:η2-O2)–Mn+ (Mn+ = Sr2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Lu3+, Y3+ and Sc3+; TMC, 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). We demonstrate that the Ca2+ and Sr2+ complexes showed similar electrochemical properties and reactivities in one-electron oxidation or reduction reactions. However, the properties and reactivities of complexes formed with stronger Lewis acidities were found to be markedly different. Complexes that contain Ca2+ or Sr2+ ions were oxidized by an electron acceptor to release O2, whereas the release of O2 did not occur for complexes that bind stronger Lewis acids. We discuss these results in the light of the functional role of the Ca2+ ion in the oxidation of water to dioxygen by the oxygen-evolving complex. Non-haem iron(III)-peroxo complexes that bind redox-inactive metal ions are synthesized to investigate the role of the Ca2+ ion in the oxidation of water to dioxygen in photosystem II. The electrochemical properties and reactions of these compounds with an electron donor and an acceptor are found to be markedly dependent on the Lewis acidity of redox-inactive metal ions.

Observation of electron-transfer-mediated decay in aqueous solution

Photoionization is at the heart of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which gives access to important information on a sample's local chemical environment. Local and non-local electronic decay after photoionization—in which the refilling of core holes results in electron emission from either the initially ionized species or a neighbour, respectively—have been well studied. However, electron-transfer-mediated decay (ETMD), which involves the refilling of a core hole by an electron from a neighbouring species, has not yet been observed in condensed phase. Here we report the experimental observation of ETMD in an aqueous LiCl solution by detecting characteristic secondary low-energy electrons using liquid-microjet soft XPS. Experimental results are interpreted using molecular dynamics and high-level ab initio calculations. We show that both solvent molecules and counterions participate in the ETMD processes, and different ion associations have distinctive spectral fingerprints. Furthermore, ETMD spectra are sensitive to coordination numbers, ion–solvent distances and solvent arrangement. Electron-transfer-mediated decay (ETMD) is a recently discovered type of electronic relaxation that involves the refilling of a core hole by an electron from a neighbouring species. It has now been observed in LiCl solution, when previously it had only been seen in rare-gas clusters. Spectra generated during ETMD are observed to be sensitive to the immediate environment of the initially ionized ion.

Three-component reaction discovery enabled by mass spectrometry of self-assembled monolayers

Multicomponent reactions are employed extensively in many areas of organic chemistry. Despite significant progress, the discovery of such enabling transformations remains challenging. Here, we present the development of a parallel, label-free reaction-discovery platform that can be used in the identification of new multicomponent transformations. Our approach is based on parallel mass spectrometric screening of interfacial chemical reactions on arrays of self-assembled monolayers. This strategy enabled the identification of a simple organic phosphine that can catalyse a previously unknown condensation of siloxyalkynes, aldehydes and amines to produce 3-hydroxyamides with high efficiency and diastereoselectivity. The reaction was further optimized using solution-phase methods. A general reaction-discovery platform has been used for identification of a new multicomponent transformation. The approach entails rapid analysis of interfacial chemical reactions on arrays of self-assembled monolayers using mass spectrometry. This enabled identification of a simple organic phosphine that catalyses a previously unknown condensation of siloxy alkynes, aldehydes and amines.

Title: 
Structural complexity through multicomponent cycloaddition cascades enabled by dual-purpose, reactivity regenerating 1,2,3-triene equivalents

Multicomponent reactions allow for more bond-forming events per synthetic operation, enabling more step- and time-economical conversion of simple starting materials to complex and thus value-added targets. These processes invariably require that reactivity be relayed from intermediate to intermediate over several mechanistic steps until a termination event produces the final product. Here, we report a multicomponent process in which a novel 1,2,3-butatriene equivalent (TMSBO: TMSCH2C≡CCH2OH) engages chemospecifically as a two-carbon alkyne component in a metal-catalysed [5&nbsp;+&nbsp;2] cycloaddition with a vinylcyclopropane to produce an intermediate cycloadduct. Under the reaction conditions, this intermediate undergoes a remarkably rapid 1,4-Peterson elimination, producing a reactive four-carbon diene intermediate that is readily intercepted in either a metal-catalysed or thermal [4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2] cycloaddition. TMSBO thus serves as an yne-to-diene transmissive reagent coupling two powerful and convergent cycloadditions—the homologous Diels–Alder and Diels–Alder cycloadditions—through a vinylogous Peterson elimination, and enabling flexible access to diverse polycycles. Cascade reactions allow step-economical generation of molecular complexity. Now, a butatriene equivalent, TMSCH2C&nbsp;≡&nbsp;CCH2OH, is used to couple two powerful and convergent cycloadditions — the homologous Diels–Alder ([5&nbsp;+&nbsp;2]) and the Diels–Alder ([4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2]) reactions –– through a vinylogous Peterson elimination, en route to a series of kinase inhibitors inspired by staurosporine.

Title: 
Harnessing redox activity for the formation of uranium tris(imido) compounds

Classically, late transition-metal organometallic compounds promote multielectron processes solely through the change in oxidation state of the metal centre. In contrast, uranium typically undergoes single-electron chemistry. However, using redox-active ligands can engage multielectron reactivity at this metal in analogy to transition metals. Here we show that a redox-flexible pyridine(diimine) ligand can stabilize a series of highly reduced uranium coordination complexes by storing one, two or three electrons in the ligand. These species reduce organoazides easily to form uranium–nitrogen multiple bonds with the release of dinitrogen. The extent of ligand reduction dictates the formation of uranium mono-, bis- and tris(imido) products. Spectroscopic and structural characterization of these compounds supports the idea that electrons are stored in the ligand framework and used in subsequent reactivity. Computational analyses of the uranium imido products probed their molecular and electronic structures, which facilitated a comparison between the bonding in the tris(imido) structure and its tris(oxo) analogue. Multi-electron redox chemistry is important in transition-metal-mediated processes, but is rarely observed with uranium due to its propensity to undergo single-electron reactions. Now, uranium can use its electrons, coupled with those stored in redox-active ligands, to perform multi electron reduction of organoazides and form uranium tris(imido) derivatives.

Improving the hydrogen oxidation reaction rate by promotion of hydroxyl adsorption

The development of hydrogen-based energy sources as viable alternatives to fossil-fuel technologies has revolutionized clean energy production using fuel cells. However, to date, the slow rate of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline environments has hindered advances in alkaline fuel cell systems. Here, we address this by studying the trends in the activity of the HOR in alkaline environments. We demonstrate that it can be enhanced more than fivefold compared to state-of-the-art platinum catalysts. The maximum activity is found for materials (Ir and Pt0.1Ru0.9) with an optimal balance between the active sites that are required for the adsorption/dissociation of H2 and for the adsorption of hydroxyl species (OHad). We propose that the more oxophilic sites on Ir (defects) and PtRu material (Ru atoms) electrodes facilitate the adsorption of OHad species. Those then react with the hydrogen intermediates (Had) that are adsorbed on more noble surface sites. Hydrogen is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels, but the slow rate of the hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkaline fuel cells hinders their development. It is now proposed that bifunctional materials can be devised to offer the optimal balance between hydrogen and hydroxyl adsorption, thus significantly reducing the amount of precious metal on the anode.

Chemical amplification of magnetic field effects relevant to avian magnetoreception

Magnetic fields as weak as the Earth's can change the yields of radical pair reactions even though the energies involved are orders of magnitude smaller than the thermal energy, kBT, at room temperature. Proposed as the source of the light-dependent magnetic compass in migratory birds, the radical pair mechanism is thought to operate in cryptochrome flavoproteins in the retina. Here we demonstrate that the primary magnetic field effect on flavin photoreactions can be amplified chemically by slow radical termination reactions under conditions of continuous photoexcitation. The nature and origin of the amplification are revealed by studies of the intermolecular flavin–tryptophan and flavin–ascorbic acid photocycles and the closely related intramolecular flavin–tryptophan radical pair in cryptochrome. Amplification factors of up to 5.6 were observed for magnetic fields weaker than 1 mT. Substantial chemical amplification could have a significant impact on the viability of a cryptochrome-based magnetic compass sensor. Proposed as the source of the light-dependent magnetic compass in migratory birds, the radical pair mechanism is thought to operate in flavoproteins in the retina. Now, it has been demonstrated that the primary magnetic field effect on flavin photoreactions can be chemically amplified by slow radical termination reactions under conditions of continuous photoexcitation.

An oxazetidine amino acid for chemical protein synthesis by rapid, serine-forming ligations

Amide-forming ligation reactions allow the chemical synthesis of proteins by the union of unprotected peptide segments, and enable the preparation of protein derivatives not accessible by expression or bioengineering approaches. The native chemical ligation (NCL) of thioesters and N-terminal cysteines is unquestionably the most successful approach, but is not ideal for all synthetic targets. Here we describe the synthesis of an Fmoc-protected oxazetidine amino acid for use in the α-ketoacid–hydroxylamine (KAHA) amide ligation. When incorporated at the N-terminus of a peptide segment, this four-membered cyclic hydroxylamine can be used for rapid serine-forming ligations with peptide α-ketoacids. This ligation operates at low concentration (100 μM–5 mM) and mild temperatures (20–25 °C). The utility of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of S100A4, a 12 kDa calcium-binding protein not easily accessible by NCL or other amide-forming reactions due to its primary sequence and properties. The total chemical synthesis of large proteins requires the development of methodology that rapidly couples unprotected peptide fragments. Here a highly strained four-membered-ring amino acid is described that enables such couplings by the formation of serine residues.

A bioinspired redox relay that mimics radical interactions of the Tyr–His pairs of photosystem II

In water-oxidizing photosynthetic organisms, light absorption generates a powerfully oxidizing chlorophyll complex (P680•+) in the photosystem II reaction centre. This is reduced via an electron transfer pathway from the manganese-containing water-oxidizing catalyst, which includes an electron transfer relay comprising a tyrosine (Tyr)–histidine (His) pair that features a hydrogen bond between a phenol group and an imidazole group. By rapidly reducing P680•+, the relay is thought to mitigate recombination reactions, thereby ensuring a high quantum yield of water oxidation. Here, we show that an artificial reaction centre that features a benzimidazole–phenol model of the Tyr–His pair mimics both the short-internal hydrogen bond in photosystem II and, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the thermal relaxation that accompanies proton-coupled electron transfer. Although this artificial system is much less complex than the natural one, theory suggests that it captures the essential features that are important in the function of the relay. An artificial reaction centre has been designed that contains a benzimidazole–phenol model of the Tyr–His relay in photosystem II. It has been seen to mimic both the short internal hydrogen bond of the natural relay, and — using electron paramagnetic resonance —the relaxation behaviour that accompanies proton-coupled electron transfer in photosystem II.

The scope and mechanism of palladium-catalysed Markovnikov alkoxycarbonylation of alkenes

Hydroesterification reactions represent a fundamental type of carbonylation reaction and constitute one of the most important industrial applications of homogeneous catalysis. Over the past 70 years, numerous catalyst systems have been developed that allow for highly linear-selective (anti-Markovnikov) reactions and are used in industry to produce linear carboxylates starting from olefins. In contrast, a general catalyst system for Markovnikov-selective alkoxycarbonylation of aliphatic olefins remains unknown. In this paper, we show that a specific palladium catalyst system consisting of PdX2/N-phenylpyrrole phosphine (X, halide) catalyses the alkoxycarbonylation of various alkenes to give the branched esters in high selectivity (branched selectivity up to 91%). The observed (and unexpected) selectivity has been rationalized by density functional theory computation that includes a dispersion correction. The selective formation of Markovnikov products in carbonylation reactions is a challenging problem, especially from unactivated substrates. Now, a highly Markovnikov-selective alkoxycarbonylation reaction is described using a catalyst system based on palladium and the cataCXium ligand POMeCy(Ph). The resulting branched carboxylates are important structural components in many flavour and fragrance products.

Title: 
Molecular length dictates the nature of charge carriers in single-molecule junctions of oxidized oligothiophenes

To develop advanced materials for electronic devices, it is of utmost importance to design organic building blocks with tunable functionality and to study their properties at the molecular level. For organic electronic and photovoltaic applications, the ability to vary the nature of charge carriers and so create either electron donors or acceptors is critical. Here we demonstrate that charge carriers in single-molecule junctions can be tuned within a family of molecules that contain electron-deficient thiophene-1,1-dioxide (TDO) building blocks. Oligomers of TDO were designed to increase electron affinity and maintain delocalized frontier orbitals while significantly decreasing the transport gap. Through thermopower measurements we show that the dominant charge carriers change from holes to electrons as the number of TDO units is increased. This results in a unique system in which the charge carrier depends on the backbone length, and provides a new means to tune p- and n-type transport in organic materials. Understanding the intrinsic electronic properties of building blocks in conjugated materials can provide powerful design guidelines to control charge transport, such as tuning the nature of the charge carriers. Now, single-molecule transport studies of a family of oxidized oligothiophenes have shown that their molecular length determines the dominant carrier type.

Actinide covalency measured by pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy

Our knowledge of actinide chemical bonds lags far behind our understanding of the bonding regimes of any other series of elements. This is a major issue given the technological as well as fundamental importance of f-block elements. Some key chemical differences between actinides and lanthanides—and between different actinides—can be ascribed to minor differences in covalency, that is, the degree to which electrons are shared between the f-block element and coordinated ligands. Yet there are almost no direct measures of such covalency for actinides. Here we report the first pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of actinide compounds. We apply the hyperfine sublevel correlation technique to quantify the electron-spin density at ligand nuclei (via the weak hyperfine interactions) in molecular thorium(III) and uranium(III) species and therefore the extent of covalency. Such information will be important in developing our understanding of the chemical bonding, and therefore the reactivity, of actinides. Covalency in actinide–­ligand bonding is poorly understood compared to that in other parts of the periodic table due to the lack of experimental data. Here, pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance methods are used to directly measure the electron spin densities at coordinated ligands in molecular thorium and uranium complexes.

How do metal ions direct ribozyme folding?

Ribozymes, which carry out phosphoryl-transfer reactions, often require Mg2+ ions for catalytic activity. The correct folding of the active site and ribozyme tertiary structure is also regulated by metal ions in a manner that is not fully understood. Here we employ coarse-grained molecular simulations to show that individual structural elements of the group I ribozyme from the bacterium Azoarcus form spontaneously in the unfolded ribozyme even at very low Mg2+ concentrations, and are transiently stabilized by the coordination of Mg2+ ions to specific nucleotides. However, competition for scarce Mg2+ and topological constraints that arise from chain connectivity prevent the complete folding of the ribozyme. A much higher Mg2+ concentration is required for complete folding of the ribozyme and stabilization of the active site. When Mg2+ is replaced by Ca2+ the ribozyme folds, but the active site remains unstable. Our results suggest that group I ribozymes utilize the same interactions with specific metal ligands for both structural stability and chemical activity. The question of how divalent metal ions direct the folding of ribozymes is a major unsolved problem. A computational model has now been used to reveal the molecular mechanism by which Mg2+ drives the Azoarcus ribozyme into a catalytically functional state. Simulations also show that although Ca2+ drives folding it leaves the active site unstable.

Ammonia synthesis using a stable electride as an electron donor and reversible hydrogen store

Industrially, the artificial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia is carried out using the Haber–Bosch process, but this process requires high temperatures and pressures, and consumes more than 1% of the world's power production. Therefore the search is on for a more environmentally benign process that occurs under milder conditions. Here, we report that a Ru-loaded electride [Ca24Al28O64]4+(e−)4 (Ru/C12A7:e−), which has high electron-donating power and chemical stability, works as an efficient catalyst for ammonia synthesis. Highly efficient ammonia synthesis is achieved with a catalytic activity that is an order of magnitude greater than those of other previously reported Ru-loaded catalysts and with almost half the reaction activation energy. Kinetic analysis with infrared spectroscopy reveals that C12A7:e− markedly enhances N2 dissociation on Ru by the back donation of electrons and that the poisoning of ruthenium surfaces by hydrogen adatoms can be suppressed effectively because of the ability of C12A7:e− to store hydrogen reversibly. Methods that fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia under mild conditions could offer a more environmentally benign alternative to the Haber–Bosch process. Now, a Ru-loaded electride, [Ca24Al28O64]4+(e−)4, is reported that acts as an efficient electron donor and reversible hydrogen store, and is demonstrated to function as an efficient catalyst for ammonia synthesis.

Self-organized architectures from assorted DNA-framed nanoparticles

The science of self-assembly has undergone a radical shift from asking questions about why individual components self-organize into ordered structures, to manipulating the resultant order. However, the quest for far-reaching nanomanufacturing requires addressing an even more challenging question: how to form nanoparticle (NP) structures with designed architectures without explicitly prescribing particle positions. Here we report an assembly concept in which building instructions are embedded into NPs via DNA frames. The integration of NPs and DNA origami frames enables the fabrication of NPs with designed anisotropic and selective interactions. Using a pre-defined set of different DNA-framed NPs, we show it is possible to design diverse planar architectures, which include periodic structures and shaped meso-objects that spontaneously emerge on mixing of the different topological types of NP. Even objects of non-trivial shapes, such as a nanoscale model of Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, can be self-assembled successfully. A broadly applicable strategy that can control the self-assembly of nanoparticles into a predefined structure has been reported. Integrating nanoparticles with DNA constructs creates individual modules that can be assembled into complex planar architectures. The approach combines nanoparticles with the selectivity and directionality of bonds provided by DNA.

Ultrafast vibrational energy transfer at the water/air interface revealed by two-dimensional surface vibrational spectroscopy

Water is very different from liquids of similar molecular weight, and one of its unique properties is the very efficient transfer of vibrational energy between molecules, which arises as a result of strong dipole–dipole interactions between the O–H oscillators. Although we have a sound understanding of such energy transfer in bulk water, we know less about how, and how quickly, transfer occurs at its interface with a hydrophobic phase, because specifically addressing the outermost monolayer is difficult. Here, we use ultrafast two-dimensional surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy to probe the interfacial energy dynamics of heavy water (D2O) at the water/air interface. The measurements reveal the presence of surprisingly rapid energy transfer, both between hydrogen-bonded interfacial water molecules (intermolecular), and between O–D groups sticking out from the water surface and those located on the same molecule and pointing towards the water bulk (intramolecular). Vibrational energy transfer occurs on sub-picosecond timescales, and its rates and pathways can be quantified directly. At water's surface, its network of hydrogen-bonds is abruptly interrupted, conferring distinct properties on interfacial water from bulk water. Understanding aqueous interfaces is essential for many environmental, technological and biophysical systems, and now the pathways and rates of energy transfer at the water/air interface are elucidated using a surface-specific ultrafast spectroscopic technique.

Discrimination of epimeric glycans and glycopeptides using IM-MS and its potential for carbohydrate sequencing

Mass spectrometry is the primary analytical technique used to characterize the complex oligosaccharides that decorate cell surfaces. Monosaccharide building blocks are often simple epimers, which when combined produce diastereomeric glycoconjugates indistinguishable by mass spectrometry. Structure elucidation frequently relies on assumptions that biosynthetic pathways are highly conserved. Here, we show that biosynthetic enzymes can display unexpected promiscuity, with human glycosyltransferase pp-α-GanT2 able to utilize both uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine and uridine diphosphate N-acetylgalactosamine, leading to the synthesis of epimeric glycopeptides in vitro. Ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) was used to separate these structures and, significantly, enabled characterization of the attached glycan based on the drift times of the monosaccharide product ions generated following collision-induced dissociation. Finally, ion-mobility mass spectrometry following fragmentation was used to determine the nature of both the reducing and non-reducing glycans of a series of epimeric disaccharides and the branched pentasaccharide Man3 glycan, demonstrating that this technique may prove useful for the sequencing of complex oligosaccharides. Identification of glycosylation patterns is complicated by the lack of sensitive analytical techniques that can distinguish between epimeric carbohydrates. It has now been shown that ion-mobility tandem mass spectrometry of ions derived from glycopeptides and oligosaccharides enables glycan stereochemistry to be determined, highlighting the potential of this technique for sequencing complex carbohydrates on cell surfaces.

Coherent ultrafast lattice-directed reaction dynamics of triiodide anion photodissociation

Solid-state reactions are influenced by the spatial arrangement of the reactants and the electrostatic environment of the lattice, which may enable lattice-directed chemical dynamics. Unlike the caging imposed by an inert matrix, an active lattice participates in the reaction, however, little evidence of such lattice participation has been gathered on ultrafast timescales due to the irreversibility of solid-state chemical systems. Here, by lowering the temperature to 80 K, we have been able to study the dissociative photochemistry of the triiodide anion (I3−) in single-crystal tetra-n-butylammonium triiodide using broadband transient absorption spectroscopy. We identified the coherently formed tetraiodide radical anion (I4•−) as a reaction intermediate. Its delayed appearance after that of the primary photoproduct, diiodide radical I2•−, indicates that I4•− was formed via a secondary reaction between a dissociated iodine radical (I•) and an adjacent I3−. This chemistry occurs as a result of the intermolecular interaction determined by the crystalline arrangement and is in stark contrast with previous solution studies. Dissociative reactions in the solid state are prone to sample damage. Now, improved sample handling and measurement conditions enable the study of the dissociative reaction of a model triatomic system in the solid state on ultrafast timescales, revealing the significant impact of lattice coordination on the reaction pathway.

Self-assembly of size-controlled liposomes on DNA nanotemplates

Artificial lipid-bilayer membranes are valuable tools for the study of membrane structure and dynamics. For applications such as the study of vesicular transport and drug delivery, there is a pressing need for artificial vesicles with controlled size. However, controlling vesicle size and shape with nanometre precision is challenging, and approaches to achieve this can be heavily affected by lipid composition. Here, we present a bio-inspired templating method to generate highly monodispersed sub-100-nm unilamellar vesicles, where liposome self-assembly was nucleated and confined inside rigid DNA nanotemplates. Using this method, we produce homogeneous liposomes with four distinct predefined sizes. We also show that the method can be used with a variety of lipid compositions and probe the mechanism of templated liposome formation by capturing key intermediates during membrane self-assembly. The DNA nanotemplating strategy represents a conceptually novel way to guide lipid bilayer formation and could be generalized to engineer complex membrane/protein structures with nanoscale precision. Precise control of vesicle size is highly desirable both for basic biochemical research and biomedical applications. Now, monodispersed sub-100-nm vesicles with predefined sizes have been produced using a method based on membrane self-assembly within a DNA-nanostructure guide.

Reversal of Hückel (anti)aromaticity in the lowest triplet states of hexaphyrins and spectroscopic evidence for Baird's rule

The reversal of (anti)aromaticity in a molecule's triplet excited state compared with its closed-shell singlet ground state is known as Baird's rule and has attracted the interest of synthetic, physical organic chemists and theorists because of the potential to modulate the fundamental properties of highly conjugated molecules. Here we show that two closely related bis-rhodium hexaphyrins (R26H and R28H) containing [26] and [28] π-electron peripheries, respectively, exhibit properties consistent with Baird's rule. In the ground state, R26H exhibits a sharp Soret-like band and distinct Q-like bands characteristic of an aromatic porphyrinoid, whereas R28H exhibits a broad absorption spectrum without Q-like bands, which is typical of an antiaromatic porphyrinoid. In contrast, the T–T absorption of R26H is broad, weak and featureless, whereas that of R28H displays an intense and sharp Soret-like band. These spectral signatures, in combination with quantum chemical calculations, are in line with qualitative expectations based on Baird's rule. In the ground state, aromatic rings contain [4n + 2] π electrons whereas antiaromatic systems have [4n] π-electrons. Baird's rule states that this situation is reversed in the lowest triplet excited state. It has now been shown using a combination of spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations that two closely related bis-rhodium hexaphyrins exhibit properties consistent with Baird's rule.

Probing the biophysical interplay between a viral genome and its capsid

The interaction between a viral capsid and its genome governs crucial steps in the life cycle of a virus, such as assembly and genome uncoating. Tuning cargo–capsid interactions is also essential for successful design and cargo delivery in engineered viral systems. Here we investigate the interplay between cargo and capsid for the picorna-like Triatoma virus using a combined native mass spectrometry and atomic force microscopy approach. We propose a topology and assembly model in which heterotrimeric pentons that consist of five copies of structural proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 are the free principal units of assembly. The interpenton contacts are established primarily by VP2. The dual role of the genome is first to stabilize the densely packed virion and, second, on an increase in pH to trigger uncoating by relaxing the stabilizing interactions with the capsid. Uncoating occurs through a labile intermediate state of the virion that reversibly disassembles into pentons with the concomitant release of protein VP4. The stability of the capsid of a virus is strongly affected by its genome. Here the interplay between capsid and genome is explored using native mass spectrometry and atomic force microscopy. A mechanism is proposed to explain how the genome of the Triatoma virus stabilizes the capsid at neutral pH, but triggers disassembly under alkaline conditions.

Ionic solutions of two-dimensional materials

Strategies for forming liquid dispersions of nanomaterials typically focus on retarding reaggregation, for example via surface modification, as opposed to promoting the thermodynamically driven dissolution common for molecule-sized species. Here we demonstrate the true dissolution of a wide range of important 2D nanomaterials by forming layered material salts that spontaneously dissolve in polar solvents yielding ionic solutions. The benign dissolution advantageously maintains the morphology of the starting material, is stable against reaggregation and can achieve solutions containing exclusively individualized monolayers. Importantly, the charge on the anionic nanosheet solutes is reversible, enables targeted deposition over large areas via electroplating and can initiate novel self-assembly upon drying. Our findings thus reveal a unique solution-like behaviour for 2D materials that enables their scalable production and controlled manipulation. Isolating nanoscale species in liquids permits their scalable manipulation, enabling numerous fundamental and applied processes. Thus, achieving true dissolution of 2D materials is particularly desirable. Now, ionic salts of a range of important layered materials have been shown to spontaneously dissolve, yielding solutions of charged, monodisperse, undamaged and easy-to-manipulate 2D nanosheets.

Cage connectivity and frontier π orbitals govern the relative stability of charged fullerene isomers

Fullerene anions and cations have unique structural, electronic, magnetic and chemical properties that make them substantially different from neutral fullerenes. Although much theoretical effort has been devoted to characterizing and predicting their properties, this has been limited to a fraction of isomeric forms, mostly for fullerene anions, and has practically ignored fullerene cations. Here we show that the concepts of cage connectivity and frontier π orbitals allow one to understand the relative stability of charged fullerene isomers without performing elaborate quantum chemistry calculations. The latter is not a trivial matter, as the number of possible isomers for a medium-sized fullerene is many more than 100,000. The model correctly predicts the structures observed experimentally and explains why the isolated pentagon rule is often violated for fullerene anions, but the opposite is found for fullerene cations. These predictions are relevant in fields as diverse as astrophysics, electrochemistry and supramolecular chemistry. The stability of charged fullerenes is not as well understood as that of their neutral counterparts, with, for example, more frequent violations of the isolated-pentagon and pentagon-adjacency penalty rules. Now, a simple model based on the concepts of cage connectivity and frontier π orbitals predicts the relative stability of cationic and anionic fullerene isomers.

Design and synthesis of the first triply twisted Möbius annulene

As long as 50 years ago theoretical calculations predicted that Möbius annulenes with only one π surface and one edge would exhibit peculiar electronic properties and violate the Hückel rules. Numerous synthetic attempts notwithstanding, the first singly twisted Möbius annulene was not prepared until 2003. Here we present a general, rational strategy to synthesize triply or even more highly twisted cyclic π systems. We apply this strategy to the preparation of a triply twisted [24]dehydroannulene, the structure of which was confirmed by X-ray analysis. Our strategy is based on the topological transformation of ‘twist’ into ‘writhe’. The advantage is twofold: the product exhibits a lower degree of strain and precursors can be designed that inherently include the writhe, which, after cyclization, ends up in the Möbius product. With our strategy, triply twisted systems are easier to prepare than their singly twisted counterparts. Most cyclic conjugated molecules, such as benzene, exhibit two sides. Möbius annulenes, however, with an odd number of 180° twists in their π system, are one-sided and violate the Hückel rule. Now, using a topological trick it is demonstrated that triply twisted systems are not particularly strained and probably easier to synthesize than singly twisted ones.

Coherent singlet fission activated by symmetry breaking

Singlet fission, in which a singlet exciton is converted to two triplet excitons, is a process that could be beneficial in photovoltaic applications. A full understanding of the dynamics of singlet fission in molecular systems requires detailed knowledge of the relevant potential energy surfaces and their (conical) intersections. However, obtaining such information is a nontrivial task, particularly for molecular aggregates. Here we investigate singlet fission in rubrene crystals using transient absorption spectroscopy and state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations. We observe a coherent and ultrafast singlet-fission channel as well as the well-known and conventional thermally assisted incoherent channel. This coherent channel is accessible because the conical intersection for singlet fission on the excited-state potential energy surface is located very close to the equilibrium position of the ground-state potential energy surface and also because of the excitation of an intermolecular symmetry-breaking mode, which activates the electronic coupling necessary for singlet fission. Singlet fission — converting a singlet exciton to two triplet excitons — may be useful for improving photovoltaic efficiency. Ultrafast spectroscopic measurements and quantum chemical calculations have now uncovered aspects of the process critical to it occurring efficiently, including the role of intermolecular vibrations and symmetry breaking, and the location of a conical intersection on the excited-state potential-energy surface.

Title: 
Dynamic control over supramolecular handedness by selecting chiral induction pathways at the solution–solid interface

A dominant theme within the research on two-dimensional chirality is the sergeant–soldiers principle, wherein a small fraction of chiral molecules (sergeants) is used to skew the handedness of achiral molecules (soldiers) to generate a homochiral surface. Here, we have combined the sergeant–soldiers principle with temperature-dependent molecular self-assembly to unravel a peculiar chiral amplification mechanism at the solution–solid interface in which, depending on the concentration of a sergeant–soldiers solution, the majority handedness of the system can either be amplified or entirely reversed after an annealing step, furnishing a homochiral surface. Two discrete pathways that affect different stages of two-dimensional crystal growth are invoked for rationalizing this phenomenon and we present a set of experiments where the access to each pathway can be precisely controlled. These results demonstrate that a detailed understanding of subtle intermolecular and interfacial interactions can be used to induce drastic changes in the handedness of a supramolecular network. The formation of homochiral supramolecular networks at solution–solid interfaces typically relies on the soldier-and-sergeant approach, in which a small amount of chiral modifier defines the handedness of the network. Now, judicious choice of the sergeant, solvent, temperature and concentration has enabled chiral induction pathways to be controlled so that a homochiral surface of either handedness can be assembled from the same system.

Chemoselective synthesis of ketones and ketimines by addition of organometallic reagents to secondary amides

The development of efficient and selective transformations is crucial in synthetic chemistry as it opens new possibilities in the total synthesis of complex molecules. Applying such reactions to the synthesis of ketones is of great importance, as this motif serves as a synthetic handle for the elaboration of numerous organic functionalities. In this context, we report a general and chemoselective method based on an activation/addition sequence on secondary amides allowing the controlled isolation of structurally diverse ketones and ketimines. The generation of a highly electrophilic imidoyl triflate intermediate was found to be pivotal in the observed exceptional functional group tolerance, allowing the facile addition of readily available Grignard and diorganozinc reagents to amides, and avoiding commonly observed over-addition or reduction side reactions. The methodology has been applied to the formal synthesis of analogues of the antineoplastic agent Bexarotene and to the rapid and efficient synthesis of unsymmetrical diketones in a one-pot procedure. To achieve chemoselective additions of organometallics to carbonyls, it is important to consider the combination of acylating agent and organometallic as a reactive pair rather than either one in isolation. Here, a chemoselective, controlled and general methodology for the conversion of secondary amides to ketones and ketimines is described.

A pentagonal cyanostar macrocycle with cyanostilbene CH donors binds anions and forms dialkylphosphate [3]rotaxanes

Since the discovery of crown ethers, macrocycles have been recognized as powerful platforms for supramolecular chemistry. Although their numbers and variations are now legion, macrocycles that are simple to make using high-yielding reactions in one pot and on the multigram scale are rare. Here we present such a discovery obtained during the creation of a C5-symmetric cyanostilbene ‘campestarene’ macrocycle, cyanostar, that employs Knoevenagel condensations in the preparation of its cyanostilbene repeat unit. In the solid state, cyanostars form π-stacked dimers constituted of chiral P and M enantiomers. The electropositive central cavity stabilizes anions with CH hydrogen-bonding units that are activated by electron-withdrawing cyano groups. In solution, the cyanostar shows high-affinity binding as 2:1 sandwich complexes, log β2&nbsp;≈&nbsp;12 and ΔG&nbsp;≈&nbsp;−70&nbsp;kJ&nbsp;mol−1, of large anions (BF4−, ClO4− and PF6−) usually considered weakly coordinating. The cyanostar's size preference allowed formation of an unprecedented [3]rotaxane templated around a dialkylphosphate. Macrocycles are key compounds in supramolecular chemistry, yet their efficient preparation is an ever present challenge. Now, it has been shown that a C5-symmetric macrocycle, termed ‘cyanostar’, can be formed in high yields on multigram scales in one pot. Cyanostars form unusually strong sandwich complexes with large and weakly coordinating anions and can template the formation of a dialkylphosphate [3]rotaxane.

Title: 
Switchable enantioseparation based on macromolecular memory of a helical polyacetylene in the solid state

In the chromatographic separation of enantiomers the order of elution is determined by the strength of diasteromeric interactions between the components of the mixture and a chiral stationary phase. For analytical purposes, it is ideal to have the minor component elute first, whereas in the preparative mode a faster elution of the major component is desirable. Here we describe a stationary phase constructed from a polyacetylene that bears 2,2′-bisphenol-derived side chains in which chirality can be switched in the solid state prior to use. Both the macromolecular helicity of the polymer backbone and the axial chirality of the side chains can be switched in the solid state by interaction with a chiral alcohol, but importantly are maintained after removal of the chiral alcohol because of a memory effect. The chiral stationary phase thus prepared was used to separate the enantiomers of trans-stilbene oxide with the enantiomer elution order determined by the preseparation treatment. Reversible chirality switching and memory is demonstrated in a helical polyacetylene. Both the helicity of the polymer backbone and the axial chirality of the side chains contribute to the memory effect. When used to produce a chiral stationary phase for a chromatographic enantiomer resolution it was possible to switch the elution order under identical chromatographic conditions.

Visualization of hierarchically structured zeolite bodies from macro to nano length scales

A major challenge in the implementation of laboratory-designed catalysts is the scale-up into technically relevant forms. Advanced characterization is essential to understand and optimize catalyst assembly and function in industrial reactors. This Article presents an integrated approach to visualizing millimetre-sized extrudates and granules of a hierarchical MFI-type zeolite, displaying trimodal networks of micropores (0.56&nbsp;nm), intracrystalline mesopores (∼10&nbsp;nm) and macropores (∼200–300&nbsp;nm). As exemplified for the conversion of methanol to olefins, the hierarchical zeolite yields a superior performance compared to its conventional analogue. The combination of dedicated specimen preparation with state-of-the-art optical, X-ray and electron-based microscopic and tomographic techniques proves a powerful methodology to reveal otherwise inaccessible information regarding structural organization over the whole range of length scales. It is expected that these tools will play a crucial role in the rationalization of scale-up principles in catalyst development. Understanding the nature of complex zeolite particles, used as catalysts in industrial reactors, is vital for their further development. Now, an integrated approach to visualizing granules of a hierarchical MFI-type zeolite, on length scales from nanometres to millimetres, is reported.

Title: 
Sulfur as a selective ‘soft’ oxidant for catalytic methane conversion probed by experiment and theory

Developing efficient catalytic processes to convert methane into useful feedstocks relies critically upon devising new coupling processes that use abundant, thermodynamically ‘mild’ oxidants together with selective catalysts. We report here on elemental sulfur as a promising ‘soft’ oxidant for selective methane conversion to ethylene over MoS2, RuS2, TiS2, PdS and Pd/ZrO2 catalysts. Experiments and density functional theory reveal that methane conversion is directly correlated with surface metal–sulfur bond strengths. Surfaces with weakly bound sulfur are more basic and activate methane C–H bonds more readily. In contrast, experimental and theoretical selectivities scale inversely with surface metal–sulfur bond strengths, and surfaces with the strongest metal–sulfur bonds afford the highest ethylene selectivities. High CH4/S ratios, short contact times and the provision of a support maximizes the coupling of CHx intermediates and selectivity to ethylene, because these conditions yield surfaces with stronger metal–sulfur bonding (for example, Pd16S7), which suppresses the over-oxidation of methane. The oxidation of methane to create useful feedstocks is hampered by over-oxidation when using O2. Now a process using gaseous sulfur as a ‘soft’ oxidant for selective conversion to ethylene over metal sulfide catalysts has been developed. Simulations show that both methane activation and ethylene selectivity is linearly correlated with catalyst metal-sulfur bond strength.

Title: 
Photochemical activity of a key donor–acceptor complex can drive stereoselective catalytic α-alkylation of aldehydes

Asymmetric catalytic variants of sunlight-driven photochemical processes hold extraordinary potential for the sustainable preparation of chiral molecules. However, the involvement of short-lived electronically excited states inherent to any photochemical reaction makes it challenging for a chiral catalyst to dictate the stereochemistry of the products. Here, we report that readily available chiral organic catalysts, with well-known utility in thermal asymmetric processes, can also confer a high level of stereocontrol in synthetically relevant intermolecular carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions driven by visible light. A unique mechanism of catalysis is proposed, wherein the catalyst is involved actively in both the photochemical activation of the substrates (by inducing the transient formation of chiral electron donor–acceptor complexes) and the stereoselectivity-defining event. We use this approach to enable transformations that are extremely difficult under thermal conditions, such as the asymmetric α-alkylation of aldehydes with alkyl halides, the formation of all-carbon quaternary stereocentres and the control of remote stereochemistry. The combination of organocatalytic and photoredox cycles has attracted much attention for its ability to solve long-standing problems in asymmetric catalysis. Here, it is shown that easily available chiral organic catalysts can guide both the stereoselectivity-defining events and, through the transient formation of photon-absorbing chiral electron donor–acceptor complexes, the photoactivation of the substrates.

Modular probes for enriching and detecting complex nucleic acid sequences

Complex DNA sequences are difficult to detect and profile, but are important contributors to human health and disease. Existing hybridization probes lack the capability to selectively bind and enrich hypervariable, long or repetitive sequences. Here, we present a generalized strategy for constructing modular hybridization probes (M-Probes) that overcomes these challenges. We demonstrate that M-Probes can tolerate sequence variations of up to 7 nt at prescribed positions while maintaining single nucleotide sensitivity at other positions. M-Probes are also shown to be capable of sequence-selectively binding a continuous DNA sequence of more than 500 nt. Furthermore, we show that M-Probes can detect genes with triplet repeats exceeding a programmed threshold. As a demonstration of this technology, we have developed a hybrid capture method to determine the exact triplet repeat expansion number in the Huntington's gene of genomic DNA using quantitative PCR. Modular hybridization probes (M-Probes) have been developed that enable sequence-selective binding of complex nucleic acid targets. The M-probes can target sequences that: are hypervariable at prescribed loci, are long continuous sequences of over 500 nucleotides, or contain repetitive sequences. A hybrid-capture assay using the M-probes was developed that was capable of determining the exact triplet repeat expansion number in the Huntington's gene from genomic DNA.

Targeted drug delivery through the traceless release of tertiary and heteroaryl amines from antibody–drug conjugates

The reversible attachment of a small-molecule drug to a carrier for targeted delivery can improve pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index. Previous studies have reported the delivery of molecules that contain primary and secondary amines via an amide or carbamate bond; however, the ability to employ tertiary-amine-containing bioactive molecules has been elusive. Here we describe a bioreversible linkage based on a quaternary ammonium that can be used to connect a broad array of tertiary and heteroaryl amines to a carrier protein. Using a concise, protecting-group-free synthesis we demonstrate the chemoselective modification of 12 complex molecules that contain a range of reactive functional groups. We also show the utility of this connection with both protease-cleavable and reductively cleavable antibody–drug conjugates that were effective and stable in vitro and in vivo. Studies with a tertiary-amine-containing antibiotic show that the resulting antibody–antibiotic conjugate provided appropriate stability and release characteristics and led to an unexpected improvement in activity over the conjugates previously connected via a carbamate. Many drugs contain tertiary and heteroaryl amines; however, these functional groups are difficult to reversibly crosslink to a carrier protein. Now, a method for conjugating anticancer and antibiotic drugs to antibodies via a quaternary ammonium salt has been developed. Cleavage of the linker results in the traceless release of the free drug and subsequent therapeutic activity.

Crystal structures of Λ-[Ru(phen)2dppz]2+ with oligonucleotides containing TA/TA and AT/AT steps show two intercalation modes

The ruthenium complex [Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+ (where phen is phenanthroline and dppz dipyridophenazine is known as a ‘light switch’ complex because its luminescence in solution is significantly enhanced in the presence of DNA. This property is poised to serve in diagnostic and therapeutic applications, but its binding mode with DNA needs to be elucidated further. Here, we describe the crystal structures of the Λ enantiomer bound to two oligonucleotide duplexes. The dppz ligand intercalates symmetrically and perpendicularly from the minor groove of the d(CCGGTACCGG)2 duplex at the central TA/TA step, but not at the central AT/AT step of d(CCGGATCCGG)2. In both structures, however, a second ruthenium complex links the duplexes through the combination of a shallower angled intercalation into the C1C2/G9G10 step at the end of the duplex, and semi-intercalation into the G3G4 step of an adjacent duplex. The TA/TA specificity of the perpendicular intercalation arises from the packing of phenanthroline ligands against the adenosine residue. Elucidating how small molecules bind to DNA is crucial to bio-sensing and therapy applications. Two crystal structures now show the binding modes of a ‘light switch’ ruthenium complex — whose luminescence in solution increases in the presence of DNA — with oligonucleotide duplexes containing either TA/TA or AT/AT central steps, revealing a specific intercalation mode with the TA/TA species.

Hydrolytic catalysis and structural stabilization in a designed metalloprotein

Metal ions are an important part of many natural proteins, providing structural, catalytic and electron transfer functions. Reproducing these functions in a designed protein is the ultimate challenge to our understanding of them. Here, we present an artificial metallohydrolase, which has been shown by X-ray crystallography to contain two different metal ions—a Zn(II) ion, which is important for catalytic activity, and a Hg(II) ion, which provides structural stability. This metallohydrolase displays catalytic activity that compares well with several characteristic reactions of natural enzymes. It catalyses p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis with an efficiency only ~100-fold less than that of human carbonic anhydrase (CA)II and at least 550-fold better than comparable synthetic complexes. Similarly, CO2 hydration occurs with an efficiency within ~500-fold of CAII. Although histidine residues in the absence of Zn(II) exhibit pNPA hydrolysis, miniscule apopeptide activity is observed for CO2 hydration. The kinetic and structural analysis of this first de novo designed hydrolytic metalloenzyme reveals necessary design features for future metalloenzymes containing one or more metals. A designed metalloprotein containing an Hg(II) trithiolate centre that provides structural stability, and a Zn(II) tris histidine centre serving as a catalytic mimic of carbonic anhydrase, is shown to display rates that are comparable to the natural enzyme for ester hydrolysis and CO2 hydration.

Nickel-centred proton reduction catalysis in a model of [NiFe] hydrogenase

Hydrogen production through water splitting is one of the most promising solutions for the storage of renewable energy. [NiFe] hydrogenases are organometallic enzymes containing nickel and iron centres that catalyse hydrogen evolution with performances that rival those of platinum. These enzymes provide inspiration for the design of new molecular catalysts that do not require precious metals. However, all heterodinuclear NiFe models reported so far do not reproduce the Ni-centred reactivity found at the active site of [NiFe] hydrogenases. Here, we report a structural and functional NiFe mimic that displays reactivity at the Ni site. This is shown by the detection of two catalytic intermediates that reproduce structural and electronic features of the Ni-L and Ni-R states of the enzyme during catalytic turnover. Under electrocatalytic conditions, this mimic displays high rates for H2 evolution (second-order rate constant of 2.5 × 104 M−1 s−1; turnover frequency of 250 s−1 at 10 mM H+ concentration) from mildly acidic solutions. [NiFe] hydrogenases are enzymes containing nickel and iron centres that catalyse hydrogen evolution with performances that rival those of platinum catalysts. Now, a NiFe model complex has been reported that mimics the structure and the Ni-centred hydrogen evolution activity found at the active site of [NiFe] hydrogenases.

Acyclic cucurbit[n]uril molecular containers enhance the solubility and bioactivity of poorly soluble pharmaceuticals

The solubility characteristics of 40–70% of new drug candidates are so poor that they cannot be formulated on their own, so new methods for increasing drug solubility are highly prized. Here, we describe a new class of general-purpose solubilizing agents—acyclic cucurbituril-type containers—which increase the solubility of ten insoluble drugs by a factor of between 23 and 2,750 by forming container–drug complexes. The containers exhibit low in vitro toxicity in human liver, kidney and monocyte cell lines, and outbred Swiss Webster mice tolerate high doses of the container without sickness or weight loss. Paclitaxel solubilized by the acyclic cucurbituril-type containers kills cervical and ovarian cancer cells more efficiently than paclitaxel alone. The acyclic cucurbituril-type containers preferentially bind cationic and aromatic drugs, but also solubilize neutral drugs such as paclitaxel, and represent an attractive extension of cyclodextrin-based technology for drug solubilization and delivery. Acyclic cucurbituril-type molecular containers have been found to increase the solubility of insoluble pharmaceutical agents in water by up to 2,750-fold. In vitro and in vivo toxicology studies suggest that the containers are well tolerated, and paclitaxel solubilized in this manner efficiently kills HeLa and SK-OV-3 cancer cells.

One-thousand-fold enhancement of high field liquid nuclear magnetic resonance signals at room temperature

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a fundamental spectroscopic technique for the study of biological systems and materials, molecular imaging and the analysis of small molecules. It detects interactions at very low energies and is thus non-invasive and applicable to a variety of targets, including animals and humans. However, one of its most severe limitations is its low sensitivity, which stems from the small interaction energies involved. Here, we report that dynamic nuclear polarization in liquid solution and at room temperature can enhance the NMR signal of 13C nuclei by up to three orders of magnitude at magnetic fields of ∼3 T. The experiment can be repeated within seconds for signal averaging, without interfering with the sample magnetic homogeneity. The method is therefore compatible with the conditions required for high-resolution NMR. Enhancement of 13C signals on various organic compounds opens up new perspectives for dynamic nuclear polarization as a general tool to increase the sensitivity of liquid NMR. The analysis of complex (bio)molecules by NMR spectroscopy is often complicated by limitations in sensitivity. Now, it has been shown that 13C NMR signals are strongly enhanced in solution by resonant microwave irradiation of a nitroxide polarizer. This method exhibits up to one-thousand-fold improvements in sensitivity, which stands to greatly improve the detail with which small molecules and metabolites can be studied.

Atomic resolution of structural changes in elastic crystals of copper(II) acetylacetonate

Single crystals are typically brittle, inelastic materials. Such mechanical responses limit their use in practical applications, particularly in flexible electronics and optical devices. Here we describe single crystals of a well-known coordination compound—copper(II) acetylacetonate—that are flexible enough to be reversibly tied into a knot. Mechanical measurements indicate that the crystals exhibit an elasticity similar to that of soft materials such as nylon, and thus display properties normally associated with both hard and soft matter. Using microfocused synchrotron radiation, we mapped the changes in crystal structure that occur on bending, and determined the mechanism that allows this flexibility with atomic precision. We show that, under strain, the molecules in the crystal reversibly rotate, and thus reorganize to allow the mechanical compression and expansion required for elasticity and still maintain the integrity of the crystal structure. Crystals are typically thought to be brittle and fragile materials, but needles of copper(II) acetylacetonate have now been shown to be flexible enough to be reversibly tied into a knot. Mechanistic investigations using synchrotron X-ray diffraction determined that the elastic bending occurs through rotation of the molecules within the crystal lattice.

Dynamic covalent chemistry of bisimines at the solid/liquid interface monitored by scanning tunnelling microscopy

Dynamic covalent chemistry relies on the formation of reversible covalent bonds under thermodynamic control to generate dynamic combinatorial libraries. It provides access to numerous types of complex functional architectures, and thereby targets several technologically relevant applications, such as in drug discovery, (bio)sensing and dynamic materials. In liquid media it was proved that by taking advantage of the reversible nature of the bond formation it is possible to combine the error-correction capacity of supramolecular chemistry with the robustness of covalent bonding to generate adaptive systems. Here we show that double imine formation between 4-(hexadecyloxy)benzaldehyde and different α,ω-diamines as well as reversible bistransimination reactions can be achieved at the solid/liquid interface, as monitored on the submolecular scale by in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy imaging. Our modular approach enables the structurally controlled reversible incorporation of various molecular components to form sophisticated covalent architectures, which opens up perspectives towards responsive multicomponent two-dimensional materials and devices. Constructing molecular architectures using dynamic covalent chemistry combines the robustness of covalent bonds with the reversibility of supramolecular chemistry. Now, a surface-mediated approach has been used to control the thermodynamic and kinetic features of dynamic processes at a surface, leading to constituent selection and selective pattern formation.

Conversion of light into macroscopic helical motion

A key goal of nanotechnology is the development of artificial machines capable of converting molecular movement into macroscopic work. Although conversion of light into shape changes has been reported and compared to artificial muscles, real applications require work against an external load. Here, we describe the design, synthesis and operation of spring-like materials capable of converting light energy into mechanical work at the macroscopic scale. These versatile materials consist of molecular switches embedded in liquid-crystalline polymer springs. In these springs, molecular movement is converted and amplified into controlled and reversible twisting motions. The springs display complex motion, which includes winding, unwinding and helix inversion, as dictated by their initial shape. Importantly, they can produce work by moving a macroscopic object and mimicking mechanical movements, such as those used by plant tendrils to help the plant access sunlight. These functional materials have potential applications in micromechanical systems, soft robotics and artificial muscles. Helices are found at every level of natural systems, where their dynamic potential is exploited to achieve a variety of functions. Here, liquid-crystalline molecular switches embedded in a polymer are used to prepare biomimetic spring-like materials that can convert molecular motion into macroscopic work.

In situ growth of nanoparticles through control of non-stoichiometry

Surfaces decorated with uniformly dispersed catalytically active nanoparticles play a key role in many fields, including renewable energy and catalysis. Typically, these structures are prepared by deposition techniques, but alternatively they could be made by growing the nanoparticles in situ directly from the (porous) backbone support. Here we demonstrate that growing nano-size phases from perovskites can be controlled through judicious choice of composition, particularly by tuning deviations from the ideal ABO3 stoichiometry. This non-stoichiometry facilitates a change in equilibrium position to make particle exsolution much more dynamic, enabling the preparation of compositionally diverse nanoparticles (that is, metallic, oxides or mixtures) and seems to afford unprecedented control over particle size, distribution and surface anchorage. The phenomenon is also shown to be influenced strongly by surface reorganization characteristics. The concept exemplified here may serve in the design and development of more sophisticated oxide materials with advanced functionality across a range of possible domains of application. Surfaces decorated with nanoparticles are typically prepared by depositing particles on the substrate. Instead, particles have now been grown in situ directly from perovskites, by exsolution through judicious tuning of the materials’ compositions, particularly their nonstoichiometry. This approach enables control over particle composition, size, surface coverage and anchorage.

Diels–Alderase-free, bis-pericyclic, [4+2] dimerization in the biosynthesis of (±)-paracaseolide A

The natural product paracaseolide A is a tetracyclic dilactone containing six adjacent stereocentres. Its skeleton occupies a unique structural space among the &gt;200,000 characterized secondary metabolites. Six different research groups have reported a chemical synthesis of this compound, five of which used a thermal, net Diels–Alder [4+2] cycloaddition and dehydration at 110 °C to access the target by dimerization of a simple butenolide precursor. Here, we report that this dimerization proceeds under much milder conditions and with a different stereochemical outcome than previously recognized. This can be rationalized by invoking a bis-pericyclic transition state. Furthermore, we find that spontaneous epimerization, necessary to correct the configuration at one key stereocentre, is viable and that natural paracaseolide A is racemic. Together, these facts point to the absence of enzymatic catalysis (that is, Diels–Alderase activity) in the cycloaddition and strongly suggest that a non-enzyme-mediated dimerization is the actual event by which paracaseolide A is produced in nature. The facile, spontaneous dimerization of a simple alkenylbutenolide monomer is relevant to the biosynthesis of racemic paracaseolide A. As supported by computation, a fully (C2-)symmetric, bis-pericyclic Diels–Alder cycloaddition transition state structure is invoked to account for the atypical exo-selectivity and room-temperature reactivity.

Irreversible xenon insertion into a small-pore zeolite at moderate pressures and temperatures

Pressure drastically alters the chemical and physical properties of materials and allows structural phase transitions and chemical reactions to occur that defy much of our understanding gained under ambient conditions. Particularly exciting is the high-pressure chemistry of xenon, which is known to react with hydrogen and ice at high pressures and form stable compounds. Here, we show that Ag16Al16Si24O8·16H2O (Ag-natrolite) irreversibly inserts xenon into its micropores at 1.7 GPa and 250 °C, while Ag+ is reduced to metallic Ag and possibly oxidized to Ag2+. In contrast to krypton, xenon is retained within the pores of this zeolite after pressure release and requires heat to desorb. This irreversible insertion and trapping of xenon in Ag-natrolite under moderate conditions sheds new light on chemical reactions that could account for the xenon deficiency relative to argon observed in terrestrial and Martian atmospheres. Several solutions to the ‘missing xenon’ problem have been proposed that involve the selective sorption of Xe in minerals found in the Earth. It is now shown that a zeolite, Ag-natrolite, absorbs and retains 28 wt% Xe at 1.7 GPa and 250 °C, conditions found in subsurface Earth, through expulsion of metallic Ag(0).

Atropselective syntheses of (−) and (+) rugulotrosin A utilizing point-to-axial chirality transfer

Chiral, dimeric natural products containing complex structures and interesting biological properties have inspired chemists and biologists for decades. A seven-step total synthesis of the axially chiral, dimeric tetrahydroxanthone natural product rugulotrosin A is described. The synthesis employs a one-pot Suzuki coupling/dimerization to generate the requisite 2,2′-biaryl linkage. Highly selective point-to-axial chirality transfer was achieved using palladium catalysis with achiral phosphine ligands. Single X-ray crystal diffraction data were obtained to confirm both the atropisomeric configuration and absolute stereochemistry of rugulotrosin A. Computational studies are described to rationalize the atropselectivity observed in the key dimerization step. Comparison of the crude fungal extract with synthetic rugulotrosin A and its atropisomer verified that nature generates a single atropisomer of the natural product. A seven-step total synthesis of the axially chiral, dimeric tetrahydroxanthone natural product rugulotrosin A is described. The synthesis employs a one-pot Suzuki coupling/dimerization to generate the 2,2′-biaryl linkage using point-to-axial chirality transfer. Computational studies are described that rationalize the observed atropselectivity.

Title: 
Highly ordered alignment of a vinyl polymer by host–guest cross-polymerization

Chain alignment can significantly influence the macroscopic properties of a polymeric material, but no general and versatile methodology has yet been reported to obtain highly ordered crystalline packing of polymer chains, with high stability. Here, we disclose a strategy that relies on ‘ordered crosslinks’ to produce polymeric materials that exhibit a crystalline arrangement. Divinyl crosslinkers (2,5-divinyl-terephthalate) were first embedded, as substitutional ligands, into the structure of a porous coordination polymer (PCP), [Cu(terephthalate)triethylenediamine0.5]n. A representative vinyl monomer, styrene, was subsequently polymerized inside the channels of the host PCP. The polystyrene chains that form within the PCP channels also crosslink with the divinyl species. This bridges together the polymer chains of adjacent channels and ensures that, on selective removal of the PCP, the polymer chains remain aligned. Indeed, the resulting material exhibits long-range order and is stable to thermal and solvent treatments, as demonstrated by X-ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. A strategy to endow vinyl polymers with pseudo-crystalline order has been devised that relies on host–guest cross-polymerization, through functionalization of the channels of a porous coordination polymer with divinyl moieties. Polymerization of vinyl monomers within the channels is accompanied with lateral crosslinking, which ensures the polymer chains remain highly ordered after removal of the host.

Charge-transfer-directed radical substitution enables para-selective C–H functionalization

Efficient C–H functionalization requires selectivity for specific C–H bonds. Progress has been made for directed aromatic substitution reactions to achieve ortho and meta selectivity, but a general strategy for para-selective C–H functionalization has remained elusive. Herein we introduce a previously unappreciated concept that enables nearly complete para selectivity. We propose that radicals with high electron affinity elicit arene-to-radical charge transfer in the transition state of radical addition, which is the factor primarily responsible for high positional selectivity. We demonstrate with a simple theoretical tool that the selectivity is predictable and show the utility of the concept through a direct synthesis of aryl piperazines. Our results contradict the notion, widely held by organic chemists, that radical aromatic substitution reactions are inherently unselective. The concept of radical substitution directed by charge transfer could serve as the basis for the development of new, highly selective C–H functionalization reactions. Exceptional positional selectivity in aromatic substitution can now be achieved through a previously unappreciated phenomenon. Radicals with high electron affinity undergo radical aromatic substitution with nearly exclusive para selectivity by eliciting significant arene-to-radical charge transfer in the transition state of addition.

Title: 
Ultrafast energy flow in the wake of solution-phase bimolecular reactions

Vibrational energy flow into reactants, and out of products, plays a key role in chemical reactivity, so understanding the microscopic detail of the pathways and rates associated with this phenomenon is of considerable interest. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to model the vibrational relaxation that occurs during the reaction CN&nbsp;+&nbsp;c-C6H12&nbsp;→&nbsp;HCN&nbsp;+&nbsp;c-C6H11 in CH2Cl2, which produces vibrationally hot HCN. The calculations reproduce the observed energy distribution, and show that HCN relaxation follows multiple timescales. Initial rapid decay occurs through energy transfer to the cyclohexyl co-product within the solvent cage, and slower relaxation follows once the products diffuse apart. Re-analysis of the ultrafast experimental data also provides evidence for the dual timescales. These results, which represent a formal violation of conventional linear response theory, provide a detailed picture of the interplay between fluctuations in organic solvent structure and thermal solution-phase chemistry. The flow of vibrational energy into reactants and out of products plays a critical role in nearly every chemical reaction. Here, a time-resolved ultrafast microscopic map of energy flow is provided for a thermal bimolecular chemical reaction that takes place in dichloromethane, a typical organic solvent.

Title: 
Switching radical stability by pH-induced orbital conversion

In most radicals the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is the highest-energy occupied molecular orbital (HOMO); however, in a small number of reported compounds this is not the case. In the present work we expand significantly the scope of this phenomenon, known as SOMO–HOMO energy-level conversion, by showing that it occurs in virtually any distonic radical anion that contains a sufficiently stabilized radical (aminoxyl, peroxyl, aminyl) non-π-conjugated with a negative charge (carboxylate, phosphate, sulfate). Moreover, regular orbital order is restored on protonation of the anionic fragment, and hence the orbital configuration can be switched by pH. Most importantly, our theoretical and experimental results reveal a dramatically higher radical stability and proton acidity of such distonic radical anions. Changing radical stability by 3–4 orders of magnitude using pH-induced orbital conversion opens a variety of attractive industrial applications, including pH-switchable nitroxide-mediated polymerization, and it might be exploited in nature. In most radicals the unpaired electron occupies the highest-energy molecular orbital. Here, it is shown that for certain stabilized radicals the presence of a remote negatively charged group not only inverts this ordering, but also leads to a dramatic increase in radical stability that is easily manipulated by pH.

Title: 
Synthesis of structurally well-defined and liquid-phase-processable graphene nanoribbons

The properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) make them good candidates for next-generation electronic materials. Whereas ‘top-down’ methods, such as the lithographical patterning of graphene and the unzipping of carbon nanotubes, give mixtures of different GNRs, structurally well-defined GNRs can be made using a ‘bottom-up’ organic synthesis approach through solution-mediated or surface-assisted cyclodehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, non-planar polyphenylene precursors were first ‘built up’ from small molecules, and then ‘graphitized’ and ‘planarized’ to yield GNRs. However, fabrication of processable and longitudinally well-extended GNRs has remained a major challenge. Here we report a bottom-up solution synthesis of long (&gt;200&nbsp;nm) liquid-phase-processable GNRs with a well-defined structure and a large optical bandgap of 1.88 eV. Self-assembled monolayers of GNRs can be observed by scanning probe microscopy, and non-contact time-resolved terahertz conductivity measurements reveal excellent charge-carrier mobility within individual GNRs. Such structurally well-defined GNRs may prove useful for fundamental studies of graphene nanostructures, as well as the development of GNR-based nanoelectronics. Liquid-phase-processable graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) over 200&nbsp;nm long and with well-defined structures have now been synthesized by a bottom-up method, and are found to have a large optical bandgap of 1.88 eV. Scanning probe microscopy revealed highly ordered self-assembled monolayers of the GNRs, and the high intrinsic charge-carrier mobility of individual ribbons was characterized by terahertz spectroscopy.

Title: 
Click and chemically triggered declick reactions through reversible amine and thiol coupling via a conjugate acceptor

The coupling and decoupling of molecular units is a fundamental undertaking of organic chemistry. Herein we report the use of a very simple conjugate acceptor, derived from Meldrum's acid, for the sequential ‘clicking’ together of an amine and a thiol in aqueous conditions at neutral pH. Subsequently, this linkage can be ‘declicked’ by a chemical trigger to release the original amine and thiol undisturbed. The reactivity differs from that of other crosslinking agents because the selectivity for sequential functionalization derives from an altering of the electrophilicity of the conjugate acceptor on the addition of the amine. We describe the use of the procedure to modify proteins, create multicomponent libraries and synthesize oligomers, all of which can be declicked to their starting components in a controlled fashion when desired. Owing to the mild reaction conditions and ease of use in a variety of applications, the method is predicted to have wide utility. It has now been shown that amines and thiols can be tethered together through a Meldrum's acid-derived conjugate acceptor for applications ranging from dynamic combinatorial chemistry to biochemistry to polymer chemistry. Furthering the utility of this chemistry, the ability to then chemically ‘declick' back to the unaltered amine and thiol components is also demonstrated.

Title: 
Formal SiH4 chemistry using stable and easy-to-handle surrogates

Monosilane (SiH4) is far less well behaved than its carbon analogue methane (CH4). It is a colourless gas that is industrially relevant as a source of elemental silicon, but its pyrophoric and explosive nature makes its handling and use challenging. Consequently, synthetic applications of SiH4 in academic laboratories are extremely rare and methodologies based on SiH4 are underdeveloped. Safe and controlled alternatives to the substituent redistribution approaches of hydrosilanes are desirable and cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylsilanes where the cyclohexa-1,4-diene units serve as placeholders for the hydrogen atoms have been identified as potent surrogates of SiH4. We disclose here that the commercially available Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, B(C6F5)3, is able to promote the release of the Si–H bond catalytically while subsequently enabling the hydrosilylation of C–C multiple bonds in the same pot. The net reactions are transition-metal-free transfer hydrosilylations with SiH4 as a building block for the preparation of various hydrosilanes. Cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-yl groups bound to silicon act as masked Si–H bonds that can be released by the action of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3). In this way, hazardous SiH4 is unleashed from appropriately substituted precursors and engages in alkene hydrosilylation promoted by the same boron catalyst. The overall process is a transfer hydrosilylation of alkenes with monosilane.

Title: 
Substrate control in stereoselective lanthionine biosynthesis

Enzymes are typically highly stereoselective catalysts that enforce a reactive conformation on their native substrates. We report here a rare example in which the substrate controls the stereoselectivity of an enzyme-catalysed Michael-type addition during the biosynthesis of lanthipeptides. These natural products contain thioether crosslinks formed by a cysteine attack on dehydrated Ser and Thr residues. We demonstrate that several lanthionine synthetases catalyse highly selective anti-additions in which the substrate (and not the enzyme) determines whether the addition occurs from the re or si face. A single point mutation in the peptide substrate completely inverted the stereochemical outcome of the enzymatic modification. Quantum mechanical calculations reproduced the experimentally observed selectivity and suggest that conformational restraints imposed by the amino-acid sequence on the transition states determine the face selectivity of the Michael-type cyclization. The stereochemical outcome of enzyme-catalysed reactions with physiological substrates is typically governed by the well-defined geometry of the enzyme active site. Now, a rare example is reported where the substrate controls the stereoselectivity of a Michael-type addition during lanthipeptide biosynthesis.

Completely recyclable biopolymers with linear and cyclic topologies via ring-opening polymerization of γ-butyrolactone

Ring-opening polymerization (ROP) is a powerful synthetic methodology for the chemical synthesis of technologically important biodegradable aliphatic polyesters from cyclic esters or lactones. However, the bioderived five-membered γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) is commonly referred as ‘non-polymerizable’ because of its low strain energy. The chemical synthesis of poly(γ-butyrolactone) (PγBL) through the ROP process has been realized only under ultrahigh pressure (20,000 atm, 160 °C) and only produces oligomers. Here we report that the ROP of γ-BL can, with a suitable catalyst, proceed smoothly to high conversions (90%) under ambient pressure to produce PγBL materials with a number-average molecular weight up to 30 kg mol–1 and with controlled linear and/or cyclic topologies. Remarkably, both linear and cyclic PγBLs can be recycled back into the monomer in quantitative yield by simply heating the bulk materials at 220 °C (linear polymer) or 300 °C (cyclic polymer) for one hour, which thereby demonstrates the complete recyclability of PγBL. Bio-derived γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) is commonly referred to as ‘non-polymerizable’ due to its low strain energy. Now it has been shown that ring-opening polymerization of γ-BL can in fact proceed to high conversions under ambient pressure with a suitable catalyst, producing high-molecular-weight polymers with controlled topologies and complete recyclability.

An antibacterial vaccination strategy based on a glycoconjugate containing the core lipopolysaccharide tetrasaccharide Hep2Kdo2

Certain non-mammalian cell wall sugars are conserved across a variety of pathogenic bacteria. This conservation of structure, combined with their structural differences when compared with mammalian sugars, make them potentially powerful epitopes for immunization. Here, we report the synthesis of a glycoconjugate that displays the so-called ‘inner core’ sugars of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls. We also describe an antibacterial vaccination strategy based on immunization with the glycoconjugate and the subsequent administration of an inhibitor that uncovers the corresponding epitope in pathogenic bacteria. The core tetrasaccharide, Hep2Kdo2, a common motif in bacterial lipopolysaccharides, was synthesized and attached via a chain linker to a diphtheria toxin mutant carrier protein. This glycoconjugate generated titres of antibodies towards the inner core tetrasaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide, which were capable of binding the cell-surface sugars of bacterial pathogenic strains including Neisseria meningitidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Exposure of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in in vitro experiments, using an inhibitor of capsular polysaccharide transport, enabled potent bacterial killing with antiserum. The presence and linkage of unusual higher sugars in the ‘inner core’ of Gram-negative bacteria makes the core lipopolysacchride tetrasaccharide Hep2Kdo2 a tough target. Now, a 2+2 glycosylation strategy has facilitated the synthesis of this glycoconjugate. Synthesis of Hep2Kdo2 enabled an antibacterial vaccination strategy based on immunization with the glycoconjugate and the subsequent administration of an inhibitor that uncovers the corresponding epitope in pathogenic bacteria.

Photoredox activation of carbon dioxide for amino acid synthesis in continuous flow

Although carbon dioxide (CO2) is highly abundant, its low reactivity has limited its use in chemical synthesis. In particular, methods for carbon–carbon bond formation generally rely on two-electron mechanisms for CO2 activation and require highly activated reaction partners. Alternatively, radical pathways accessed via photoredox catalysis could provide new reactivity under milder conditions. Here we demonstrate the direct coupling of CO2 and amines via the single-electron reduction of CO2 for the photoredox-catalysed continuous flow synthesis of α-amino acids. By leveraging the advantages of utilizing gases and photochemistry in flow, a commercially available organic photoredox catalyst effects the selective α-carboxylation of amines that bear various functional groups and heterocycles. The preliminary mechanistic studies support CO2 activation and carbon–carbon bond formation via single-electron pathways, and we expect that this strategy will inspire new perspectives on using this feedstock chemical in organic synthesis. Although the synthetic chemistry of carbon dioxide has generally been limited to two-electron pathways, single-electron mechanisms would open avenues to new reactivity. Now, the coupling of carbon dioxide and amines to produce α-amino acids can be achieved by an organic photoredox catalyst in continuous flow.

A polymer nanoparticle with engineered affinity for a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165)

Protein affinity reagents are widely used in basic research, diagnostics and separations and for clinical applications, the most common of which are antibodies. However, they often suffer from high cost, and difficulties in their development, production and storage. Here we show that a synthetic polymer nanoparticle (NP) can be engineered to have many of the functions of a protein affinity reagent. Polymer NPs with nM affinity to a key vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) inhibit binding of the signalling protein to its receptor VEGFR-2, preventing receptor phosphorylation and downstream VEGF165-dependent endothelial cell migration and invasion into the extracellular matrix. In addition, the NPs inhibit VEGF-mediated new blood vessel formation in Matrigel plugs in vivo. Importantly, the non-toxic NPs were not found to exhibit off-target activity. These results support the assertion that synthetic polymers offer a new paradigm in the search for abiotic protein affinity reagents by providing many of the functions of their protein counterparts. Abiotic hydrogel polymer nanoparticles with affinity for a key vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) have now been developed. This high-protein affinity was engineered by carefully controlling the amount and the substitution pattern of sulfated N-acetylglucosamines and the inclusion of a hydrophobic group in the monomer.

RNA catalysis through compartmentalization

RNA performs important cellular functions in contemporary life forms. Its ability to act both as a catalyst and a storage mechanism for genetic information is also an important part of the RNA world hypothesis. Compartmentalization within modern cells allows the local concentration of RNA to be controlled and it has been suggested that this was also important in early life forms. Here, we mimic intracellular compartmentalization and macromolecular crowding by partitioning RNA in an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS). We show that the concentration of RNA is enriched by up to 3,000-fold in the dextran-rich phase of a polyethylene glycol/dextran ATPS and demonstrate that this can lead to approximately 70-fold increase in the rate of ribozyme cleavage. This rate enhancement can be tuned by the relative volumes of the two phases in the ATPS. Our observations support the importance of compartmentalization in the attainment of function in an RNA World as well as in modern biology. RNA compartmentalization is essential for cellular functions and may have played a pivotal role in the emergence of life. However, the consequences of compartmentalization on RNA catalysis have been largely unexplored. Here, partitioning of catalytic RNA in a two-phase aqueous polymer solution increased local RNA concentration, enhancing ribozyme kinetics.

All-cis 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane is a facially polarized cyclohexane

The highest-energy stereoisomer of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane, in which all of the fluorines are ‘up’, is prepared in a 12-step protocol. The molecule adopts a classic chair conformation with alternate C–F bonds aligned triaxially, clustering three highly electronegative fluorine atoms in close proximity. This generates a cyclohexane with a high molecular dipole (μ = 6.2 D), unusual in an otherwise aliphatic compound. X-ray analysis indicates that the intramolecular Fax···Fax distances (∼2.77 Å) are longer than the vicinal Fax···Feq­ distances (∼2.73 Å) suggesting a tension stabilizing the chair conformation. In the solid state the molecules pack in an orientation consistent with electrostatic ordering. Our synthesis of this highest-energy isomer demonstrates the properties that accompany the placement of axial fluorines on a cyclohexane and the unusual property of a facially polarized ring in organic chemistry. Derivatives have potential as new motifs for the design of functional organic molecules or for applications in supramolecular chemistry design. The highest-energy stereoisomer of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane, with all the fluorines ‘up’, has been prepared in a 12-step protocol. The molecule adopts a chair conformation with three triaxial C–F bonds on one face generating a polarized ring. In the solid state the molecules pack in an orientation consistent with electrostatic ordering.

Rhodium-catalysed asymmetric allylic arylation of racemic halides with arylboronic acids

cross-coupling reactions between arylboronic acid and aryl halides are widely used in both academia and industry and are strategically important in the development of new agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. cross-coupling reactions have been developed, but enantioselective variations are rare and simply retaining the stereochemistry is a problem. Here we report a highly enantioselective bond-forming method that couples arylboronic acids to racemic allyl chlorides. Both enantiomers of a cyclic chloride are converted into a single enantiomer of product via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation. This Rh-catalysed method uses readily available and inexpensive building blocks and is mild and broadly applicable. For electron-deficient, electron-rich or ortho-substituted boronic acids better results are obtained with racemic allyl bromides. Oxygen substitution in the allyl halide is tolerated and the products can be functionalized to provide diverse building blocks. The approach fills a significant gap in the methods for catalytic asymmetric synthesis. Cross-couplings between boronic acids and halides are a mainstay of synthetic organic chemistry but enantioselective couplings are rare, and simply retaining the stereochemistry of the starting material is problematic. Now, it is shown that racemic allylic halides can converted to single enantiomer products by a rhodium(I)-catalysed asymmetric allylic arylation using arylboronic acids

A prebiotically plausible synthesis of pyrimidine β-ribonucleosides and their phosphate derivatives involving photoanomerization

Previous research has identified ribose aminooxazoline as a potential intermediate in the prebiotic synthesis of the pyrimidine nucleotides with remarkable properties. It crystallizes spontaneously from reaction mixtures, with an enhanced enantiomeric excess if initially enantioenriched, which suggests that reservoirs of this compound might have accumulated on the early Earth in an optically pure form. Ribose aminooxazoline can be converted efficiently into α-ribocytidine by way of 2,2′-anhydroribocytidine, although anomerization to β-ribocytidine by ultraviolet irradiation is extremely inefficient. Our previous work demonstrated the synthesis of pyrimidine β-ribonucleotides, but at the cost of ignoring ribose aminooxazoline, using arabinose aminooxazoline instead. Here we describe a long-sought route through ribose aminooxazoline to the pyrimidine β-ribonucleosides and their phosphate derivatives that involves an extraordinarily efficient photoanomerization of α-2-thioribocytidine. In addition to the canonical nucleosides, our synthesis accesses β-2-thioribouridine, a modified nucleoside found in transfer RNA that enables both faster and more-accurate nucleic acid template-copying chemistry. Although ribose aminooxazoline has been shown to be a potential intermediate in prebiotic pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis, a route by which this could occur has remained elusive. Now, a remarkably efficient photoanomerization reaction has been investigated by theory and experiment. The new route affords enantiomerically pure ribonucleotides when the starting material is enantioenriched.

Templated assembly of photoswitches significantly increases the energy-storage capacity of solar thermal fuels

Large-scale utilization of solar-energy resources will require considerable advances in energy-storage technologies to meet ever-increasing global energy demands. Other than liquid fuels, existing energy-storage materials do not provide the requisite combination of high energy density, high stability, easy handling, transportability and low cost. New hybrid solar thermal fuels, composed of photoswitchable molecules on rigid, low-mass nanostructures, transcend the physical limitations of molecular solar thermal fuels by introducing local sterically constrained environments in which interactions between chromophores can be tuned. We demonstrate this principle of a hybrid solar thermal fuel using azobenzene-functionalized carbon nanotubes. We show that, on composite bundling, the amount of energy stored per azobenzene more than doubles from 58 to 120&nbsp;kJ mol–1, and the material also maintains robust cyclability and stability. Our results demonstrate that solar thermal fuels composed of molecule–nanostructure hybrids can exhibit significantly enhanced energy-storage capabilities through the generation of template-enforced steric strain. Solar thermal fuels have recently attracted an increasing amount of attention as a potential method for solar energy capture, conversion, storage and utilization. Azobenzene-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes demonstrate the proof-of-principle for increasing kinetic stability and energy densities by templating photoswitchable molecules on nanostructures to achieve highly (con)strained configurations.

Understanding and controlling the substrate effect on graphene electron-transfer chemistry via reactivity imprint lithography

Graphene has exceptional electronic, optical, mechanical and thermal properties, which provide it with great potential for use in electronic, optoelectronic and sensing applications. The chemical functionalization of graphene has been investigated with a view to controlling its electronic properties and interactions with other materials. Covalent modification of graphene by organic diazonium salts has been used to achieve these goals, but because graphene comprises only a single atomic layer, it is strongly influenced by the underlying substrate. Here, we show a stark difference in the rate of electron-transfer reactions with organic diazonium salts for monolayer graphene supported on a variety of substrates. Reactions proceed rapidly for graphene supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 (sapphire), but negligibly on alkyl-terminated and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) surfaces, as shown by Raman spectroscopy. We also develop a model of reactivity based on substrate-induced electron–hole puddles in graphene, and achieve spatial patterning of chemical reactions in graphene by patterning the substrate. The chemical modification of graphene is important for its use in many applications. Now it is shown that the reactivity of graphene towards covalent modification varies widely depending on its underlying support substrate, and that the substrate can be patterned to induce spatial control of chemical reactions in graphene.

A robustness screen for the rapid assessment of chemical reactions

In contrast to the rapidity with which scientific information is published, the application of new knowledge often remains slow, and we believe this to be particularly true of newly developed synthetic organic chemistry methodology. Consequently, methods to assess and identify robust chemical reactions are desirable, and would directly facilitate the application of newly reported synthetic methodology to complex synthetic problems. Here, we describe a simple process for assessing the likely scope and limitations of a chemical reaction beyond the idealized reaction conditions initially reported. Using simple methods and common analytical techniques we demonstrate a rapid assessment of an established chemical reaction, and also propose a simplified analysis that may be reported alongside new synthetic methodology. For researchers to rapidly adopt new synthetic methodology, they need to gauge whether the reaction will work for their substrate — a point not easily conveyed by traditional screens of reaction scope. Here, a simple method is described to assess the likely scope and limitations of a chemical reaction beyond the idealized conditions initially reported.

Imparting functionality to a metal–organic framework material by controlled nanoparticle encapsulation

Microporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) that display permanent porosity show great promise for a myriad of purposes. The potential applications of MOFs can be developed further and extended by encapsulating various functional species (for example, nanoparticles) within the frameworks. However, despite increasing numbers of reports of nanoparticle/MOF composites, simultaneously to control the size, composition, dispersed nature, spatial distribution and confinement of the incorporated nanoparticles within MOF matrices remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a controlled encapsulation strategy that enables surfactant-capped nanostructured objects of various sizes, shapes and compositions to be enshrouded by a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8). The incorporated nanoparticles are well dispersed and fully confined within the ZIF-8 crystals. This strategy also allows the controlled incorporation of multiple nanoparticles within each ZIF-8 crystallite. The as-prepared nanoparticle/ZIF-8 composites exhibit active (catalytic, magnetic and optical) properties that derive from the nanoparticles as well as molecular sieving and orientation effects that originate from the framework material. Surfactant-capped nanoparticles of various sizes, shapes and compositions have been completely enshrouded within a metal–organic framework in a controlled, well-dispersed manner. The resulting hybrid materials exhibit active properties — catalytic, magnetic and optical — arising from the nanoparticles as well as sieving and orientation effects originating from the porous framework.

Single-molecule spectroscopy of LHCSR1 protein dynamics identifies two distinct states responsible for multi-timescale photosynthetic photoprotection

In oxygenic photosynthesis, light harvesting is regulated to safely dissipate excess energy and prevent the formation of harmful photoproducts. Regulation is known to be necessary for fitness, but the molecular mechanisms are not understood. One challenge has been that ensemble experiments average over active and dissipative behaviours, preventing identification of distinct states. Here, we use single-molecule spectroscopy to uncover the photoprotective states and dynamics of the light-harvesting complex stress-related 1 (LHCSR1) protein, which is responsible for dissipation in green algae and moss. We discover the existence of two dissipative states. We find that one of these states is activated by pH and the other by carotenoid composition, and that distinct protein dynamics regulate these states. Together, these two states enable the organism to respond to two types of intermittency in solar intensity—step changes (clouds and shadows) and ramp changes (sunrise), respectively. Our findings reveal key control mechanisms underlying photoprotective dissipation, with implications for increasing biomass yields and developing robust solar energy devices. Photoprotection is crucial for the fitness of organisms that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. LHCSR, a photosynthetic light-harvesting complex, has been implicated in photoprotection in green algae and moss. Now, single-molecule studies of LHCSR have revealed that multi-timescale protein dynamics underlie photoprotective dissipation of excess energy.

Sequence-controlled methacrylic multiblock copolymers via sulfur-free RAFT emulsion polymerization

Translating the precise monomer sequence control achieved in nature over macromolecular structure (for example, DNA) to whole synthetic systems has been limited due to the lack of efficient synthetic methodologies. So far, chemists have only been able to synthesize monomer sequence-controlled macromolecules by means of complex, time-consuming and iterative chemical strategies such as solid-state Merrifield-type approaches or molecularly dissolved solution-phase systems. Here, we report a rapid and quantitative synthesis of sequence-controlled multiblock polymers in discrete stable nanoscale compartments via an emulsion polymerization approach in which a vinyl-terminated macromolecule is used as an efficient chain-transfer agent. This approach is environmentally friendly, fully translatable to industry and thus represents a significant advance in the development of complex macromolecule synthesis, where a high level of molecular precision or monomer sequence control confers potential for molecular targeting, recognition and biocatalysis, as well as molecular information storage. Achieving sequence control in a synthetic polymer is more challenging and time consuming than it is for biopolymers. Now, it has been shown that the synthesis of sequence-controlled multiblock copolymers can be carried out via emulsion polymerization. This approach is environmentally friendly and yields complex multiblock materials with low dispersity and high yields.

Mechanochemical strengthening of a synthetic polymer in response to typically destructive shear forces

High shear stresses are known to trigger destructive bond-scission reactions in polymers. Recent work has shown that the same shear forces can be used to accelerate non-destructive reactions in mechanophores along polymer backbones, and it is demonstrated here that such mechanochemical reactions can be used to strengthen a polymer subjected to otherwise destructive shear forces. Polybutadiene was functionalized with dibromocyclopropane mechanophores, whose mechanical activation generates allylic bromides that are crosslinked in situ by nucleophilic substitution reactions with carboxylates. The crosslinking is activated efficiently by shear forces both in solvated systems and in bulk materials, and the resulting covalent polymer networks possess moduli that are orders-of-magnitude greater than those of the unactivated polymers. These molecular-level responses and their impact on polymer properties have implications for the design of materials that, like biological materials, actively remodel locally as a function of their physical environment. Materials typically break down in response to the repeated mechanical forces that they experience during use. Now, it has been shown that a mechanochemically active polymer can respond to shear forces by forming more bonds than are broken, leading to improved mechanical properties under conditions that would otherwise be destructive.

Fast response dry-type artificial molecular muscles with [c2]daisy chains

Hierarchically organized myosin and actin filaments found in biological systems exhibit contraction and expansion behaviours that produce work and force by consuming chemical energy. Inspired by these naturally occurring examples, we have developed photoresponsive wet- and dry-type molecular actuators built from rotaxane-based compounds known as [c2]daisy chains (specifically, [c2]AzoCD2 hydrogel and [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel). These actuators were prepared via polycondensation between four-armed poly(ethylene glycol) and a [c2]daisy chain based on α-cyclodextrin as the host component and azobenzene as a photoresponsive guest component. The light-induced actuation arises from the sliding motion of the [c2]daisy chain unit. Ultraviolet irradiation caused the gels to bend towards the light source. The response of the [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel, even under dry conditions, is very fast (7° every second), which is 10,800 times faster than the [c2]AzoCD2 hydrogel (7° every 3 h). In addition, the [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel was used as a crane arm to lift an object using ultraviolet irradiation to produce mechanical work. Photoresponsive wet- and dry-type actuators can be built up from rotaxane-like structures through the polycondensation of four-armed polyethylene glycols with [c2]daisy chains comprised of cyclodextrin rings and azobenzene side chains. The response of the dry-type (xerogel) actuator to UV light was found to be more than 10,000 times faster than the wet-type (hydrogel) actuator.

Multiphase design of autonomic self-healing thermoplastic elastomers

The development of polymers that can spontaneously repair themselves after mechanical damage would significantly improve the safety, lifetime, energy efficiency and environmental impact of man-made materials. Most approaches to self-healing materials require the input of external energy, healing agents, solvent or plasticizer. Despite intense research in this area, the synthesis of a stiff material with intrinsic self-healing ability remains a key challenge. Here, we show a design of multiphase supramolecular thermoplastic elastomers that combine high modulus and toughness with spontaneous healing capability. The designed hydrogen-bonding brush polymers self-assemble into a hard–soft microphase-separated system, combining the enhanced stiffness and toughness of nanocomposites with the self-healing capability of dynamic supramolecular assemblies. In contrast to previous self-healing polymers, this new system spontaneously self-heals as a single-component solid material at ambient conditions, without the need for any external stimulus, healing agent, plasticizer or solvent. Polymer materials that could spontaneously heal like tissues in living systems would significantly improve the safety, lifetime, energy efficiency and environmental impact of man-made materials. Now, a general multiphase design of autonomous self-healing elastomeric materials that do not require the input of external energy or healing agents is reported.

Title: 
Incorporation of protein flexibility and conformational energy penalties in docking screens to improve ligand discovery

Proteins fluctuate between alternative conformations, which presents a challenge for ligand discovery because such flexibility is difficult to treat computationally owing to problems with conformational sampling and energy weighting. Here we describe a flexible docking method that samples and weights protein conformations using experimentally derived conformations as a guide. The crystallographically refined occupancies of these conformations, which are observable in an apo receptor structure, define energy penalties for docking. In a large prospective library screen, we identified new ligands that target specific receptor conformations of a cavity in cytochrome c peroxidase, and we confirm both ligand pose and associated receptor conformation predictions by crystallography. The inclusion of receptor flexibility led to ligands with new chemotypes and physical properties. By exploiting experimental measures of loop and side-chain flexibility, this method can be extended to the discovery of new ligands for hundreds of targets in the Protein Data Bank for which similar experimental information is available. The adoption of multiple conformations by proteins presents a challenge for ligand discovery using docking simulations. Now, a method for representing the conformational behaviour of a flexible protein in docking screens, which is guided by experimental crystallography data, is shown to predict protein conformation, ligand pose and aid the discovery of new ligands.

Title: 
Discovery of a regioselectivity switch in nitrating P450s guided by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov models

The dynamic motions of protein structural elements, particularly flexible loops, are intimately linked with diverse aspects of enzyme catalysis. Engineering of these loop regions can alter protein stability, substrate binding and even dramatically impact enzyme function. When these flexible regions are unresolvable structurally, computational reconstruction in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations can be used to guide the engineering strategy. Here we present a collaborative approach that consists of both experiment and computation and led to the discovery of a single mutation in the F/G loop of the nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE that simultaneously controls loop dynamics and completely shifts the enzyme's regioselectivity from the C4 to the C5 position of L-tryptophan. Furthermore, we find that this loop mutation is naturally present in a subset of homologous nitrating P450s and confirm that these uncharacterized enzymes exclusively produce 5-nitro-L-tryptophan, a previously unknown biosynthetic intermediate. A collaborative approach between experiment and simulation has revealed a single mutation in the F/G loop of the newly described nitrating cytochrome P450 TxtE that controls loop dynamics and, more surprisingly, the regioselectivity of the reaction. This mutation is present in a subset of homologous nitrating P450s that produce a previously unidentified biosynthetic intermediate, 5-nitro-L-tryptophan.

Title: 
Bond-strengthening π backdonation in a transition-metal π-diborene complex

Transition-metal catalysis is founded on the principle that electron donation from a metal to a ligand is accepted by an antibonding orbital of the ligand, thereby weakening one of the bonds in the ligand. Without this, the initial step of bond activation in many catalytic processes would simply not occur. This concept is enshrined in the well-accepted Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model of transition-metal bonding. We present herein experimental and computational evidence for the first true violation of the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson bonding model, found in a π-diborene complex in which an electron-rich group 10 metal donates electrons into an empty bonding π orbital on the ligand, and thereby strengthens the bond. The complex is also the first transition-metal complex to contain a bound diborene, a species not isolated before, either in its free form or bound to a metal. A form of π backbonding is observed in a π-diborene complex of platinum, and confirmed by calculations. This interaction partially fills a bonding π orbital on the diborene ligand, strengthening the B–B bond. That π backbonding can strengthen bonds overturns ingrained notions that π backbonding is exclusively a bond-weakening phenomenon.

Title: 
Peptide tessellation yields micrometre-scale collagen triple helices

Sticky-ended DNA duplexes can associate spontaneously into long double helices; however, such self-assembly is much less developed with proteins. Collagen is the most prevalent component of the extracellular matrix and a common clinical biomaterial. As for natural DNA, the ~103-residue triple helices (~300 nm) of natural collagen are recalcitrant to chemical synthesis. Here we show how the self-assembly of short collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) can enable the fabrication of synthetic collagen triple helices that are nearly a micrometre in length. Inspired by the mathematics of tessellations, we derive rules for the design of single CMPs that self-assemble into long triple helices with perfect symmetry. Sticky ends thus created are uniform across the assembly and drive its growth. Enacting this design yields individual triple helices that, in length, match or exceed those in natural collagen and are remarkably thermostable, despite the absence of higher-order association. The symmetric assembly of CMPs provides an enabling platform for the development of advanced materials for medicine and nanotechnology. Natural collagen contains triple helices that are approximately 1,000 residues in length and cannot be formed by chemical synthesis. Now, short collagen-mimetic peptides that self-assemble into three-stranded helices have been designed. These peptides are inspired by the mathematics of tessellations, and the triple helices formed via this approach match or exceed the length of those found in natural collagen.

Title: 
A subset of annular lipids is linked to the flippase activity of an ABC transporter

Lipids are critical components of membranes that could affect the properties of membrane proteins, yet the precise compositions of lipids surrounding membrane-embedded protein complexes is often difficult to discern. Here we report that, for the heterodimeric ABC transporter TmrAB, the extent of delipidation can be controlled by timed exposure to detergent. We subsequently characterize the cohort of endogenous lipids that are extracted in contact with the membrane protein complex, and show that with prolonged delipidation the number of neutral lipids is reduced in favour of their negatively charged counterparts. We show that lipid A is retained by the transporter and that the extent of its binding decreases during the catalytic cycle, implying that lipid A release is linked to adenosine tri-phosphate hydrolysis. Together, these results enable us to propose that a subset of annular lipids is invariant in composition, with negatively charged lipids binding tightly to TmrAB, and imply a role for this exporter in glycolipid translocation. Defining the lipid composition that exists around a membrane protein complex in natural bilayers is a challenging task. Now, key lipids that are important for the structure and function of an ABC transporter have been revealed by systematically removing layers of lipids, and using mass spectrometry to monitor those that remained closely associated with the membrane protein.

A chemically powered unidirectional rotary molecular motor based on a palladium redox cycle

The conversion of chemical energy to drive directional motion at the molecular level allows biological systems, ranging from subcellular components to whole organisms, to perform a myriad of dynamic functions and respond to changes in the environment. Directional movement has been demonstrated in artificial molecular systems, but the fundamental motif of unidirectional rotary motion along a single-bond rotary axle induced by metal-catalysed transformation of chemical fuels has not been realized, and the challenge is to couple the metal-centred redox processes to stepwise changes in conformation to arrive at a full unidirectional rotary cycle. Here, we present the design of an organopalladium-based motor and the experimental demonstration of a 360° unidirectional rotary cycle using simple chemical fuels. Exploiting fundamental reactivity principles in organometallic chemistry enables control of directional rotation and offers the potential of harnessing the wealth of opportunities offered by transition-metal-based catalytic conversions to drive motion and dynamic functions. Control of motion at the molecular level is an integral requirement for the development of future nanoscale machinery. Now, governed by the fundamental reactivity principles of organometallic chemistry, a biaryl rotor is shown to exhibit 360° unidirectional rotary motion driven by the conversion of two simple fuels.

Title: 
Controlled homocatenation of boron on a transition metal

Only a handful of elements are able to be controllably homocatenated (that is, to be formed into one- or two-dimensional chains or rings of the element), because most have weak element–element bonds. Boron forms strong B–B bonds, but its favourable cluster formation makes homocatenation very difficult. Recently, the coupling of borylene (:BR) ligands on a metal was predicted computationally. We have brought this prediction to fruition experimentally, and extended it by adding two further borylene units, stepwise forming a B4 chain bound to a metal under mild conditions. This complex is a useful model for understanding the metal–boron interactions required to promote transition of the boron atoms from borylene ligands to oligoborane networks bound side-on. The concept shows great promise for the controlled construction of one-dimensional boron chains. Mild, controllable homocatenation of many elements is a considerable challenge, usually due to their low homonuclear σ-bond enthalpy. This is particularly difficult for boron, despite its high homonuclear σ -bond enthalpy. The controllable metal-templated catenation of four boron atoms is now demonstrated — a step towards oligomers of monovalent boron and polyboranes.

Title: 
Tailored hierarchical micelle architectures using living crystallization-driven self-assembly in two dimensions

Recent advances in the self-assembly of block copolymers have enabled the precise fabrication of hierarchical nanostructures using low-cost solution-phase protocols. However, the preparation of well-defined and complex planar nanostructures in which the size is controlled in two dimensions (2D) has remained a challenge. Using a series of platelet-forming block copolymers, we have demonstrated through quantitative experiments that the living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) approach can be extended to growth in 2D. We used 2D CDSA to prepare uniform lenticular platelet micelles of controlled size and to construct precisely concentric lenticular micelles composed of spatially distinct functional regions, as well as complex structures analogous to nanoscale single- and double-headed arrows and spears. These methods represent a route to hierarchical nanostructures that can be tailored in 2D, with potential applications as diverse as liquid crystals, diagnostic technology and composite reinforcement. Self-assembly is commonly used to construct complex nanostructures from soft matter. Now, using the living crystallization-driven self-assembly approach, controlled nanostructure growth in both one and two dimensions has been achieved. Uniform lenticular multiblock platelets, as well as hierarchical structures analogous to nanoscale single- and double-headed arrows and spears have been prepared with controlled sizes in two dimensions.

The use of elemental sulfur as an alternative feedstock for polymeric materials

An excess of elemental sulfur is generated annually from hydrodesulfurization in petroleum refining processes; however, it has a limited number of uses, of which one example is the production of sulfuric acid. Despite this excess, the development of synthetic and processing methods to convert elemental sulfur into useful chemical substances has not been investigated widely. Here we report a facile method (termed ‘inverse vulcanization’) to prepare chemically stable and processable polymeric materials through the direct copolymerization of elemental sulfur with vinylic monomers. This methodology enabled the modification of sulfur into processable copolymer forms with tunable thermomechanical properties, which leads to well-defined sulfur-rich micropatterned films created by imprint lithography. We also demonstrate that these copolymers exhibit comparable electrochemical properties to elemental sulfur and could serve as the active material in Li–S batteries, exhibiting high specific capacity (823&nbsp;mA h g−1 at 100 cycles) and enhanced capacity retention. A polymerization method for converting elemental sulfur into a chemically stable, processable and electrochemically active copolymer has been described. This methodology — termed inverse vulcanization — is conducted by a one-step process using liquid sulfur, as both reaction medium and reactant, and vinylic comonomers to form polymeric materials with a high content of sulfur (50–90&nbsp;wt%).

Title: 
Signal transduction in a covalent post-assembly modification cascade

Natural reaction cascades control the movement of biomolecules between cellular compartments. Inspired by these systems, we report a synthetic reaction cascade employing post-assembly modification reactions to direct the partitioning of supramolecular complexes between phases. The system is composed of a self-assembled tetrazine-edged FeII8L12 cube and a maleimide-functionalized FeII4L6 tetrahedron. Norbornadiene (NBD) functions as the stimulus that triggers the cascade, beginning with the inverse-electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction of NBD with the tetrazine moieties of the cube. This reaction generates cyclopentadiene as a transient by-product, acting as a relay signal that subsequently undergoes a Diels–Alder reaction with the maleimide-functionalized tetrahedron. Cyclooctyne can selectively inhibit the cascade by outcompeting NBD as the initial trigger. Initiating the cascade with 2-octadecyl NBD leads to selective alkylation of the tetrahedron upon cascade completion. The increased lipophilicity of the C18-tagged tetrahedron drives this complex into a non-polar phase, allowing its isolation from the initially inseparable mixture of complexes. Two coordination cages have been devised that undergo covalent modification during a cascade of two orthogonal Diels–Alder reactions. This results in increased lipophilicity for the second cage, enabling its phase transfer and separation from the first. The trigger, relay and inhibition features of this cascade system mimic key aspects of natural post-translational modification cascades.

Title: 
A multistep single-crystal-to-single-crystal bromodiacetylene dimerization

Packing constraints and precise placement of functional groups are the reason that organic molecules in the crystalline state often display unusual physical or chemical properties not observed in solution. Here we report a single-crystal-to-single-crystal dimerization of a bromodiacetylene that involves unusually large atom displacements as well as the cleavage and formation of several bonds. Density functional theory computations support a mechanism in which the dimerization is initiated by a [2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1] photocycloaddition favoured by the nature of carbon–carbon short contacts in the crystal structure. The reaction proceeded up to the theoretical degree of conversion without loss of crystallinity, and it was also performed on a preparative scale with good yield. Moreover, it represents the first synthetic pathway to (E)-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diethynylethenes, which could serve as synthetic intermediates for the preparation of molecular carbon scaffolds. Our findings both extend the scope of single-crystal-to-single-crystal reactions and highlight their potential as a synthetic tool for complex transformations. The photochemical-induced dimerization of bromine-terminated oligo(ethynylene)s in the solid state is shown to give 1,2-dibromoeneynes on a preparative scale. This single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation proceeds through a multistep reaction that involves the making and breaking of several bonds in addition to large atom displacements. The reaction represents an atom-efficient and catalyst-free pathway towards functional carbon-rich molecular scaffolds.

Pseudopterosin synthesis from a chiral cross-conjugated hydrocarbon through a series of cycloadditions

The pseudopterosins are a family of diterpene marine natural products, which, by virtue of their interesting anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, have attracted the attentions of many synthetic chemists. The most efficient syntheses reported to date are 14 and 20 steps in the longest linear sequence for chiral pool and enantioselective approaches, respectively, and all start with precursors that are easily mapped onto the natural product structure. Here, we describe an unconventional approach in which a chiral cross-conjugated hydrocarbon is used as the starting material for a series of three cycloadditions. Our approach has led to a significant reduction in the step count required to access these interesting natural products (10 steps chiral pool and 11 steps enantioselective). Furthermore it demonstrates that cross-conjugated hydrocarbons, erroneously considered by many to be too unstable and difficult to handle, are viable precursors for natural product synthesis. The pseudopterosins are a family of natural products whose interesting anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties have inspired many synthetic approaches. Now, an unusual approach that starts with an axially chiral hydrocarbon that engages in a triple Diels–Alder sequence has been shown to result in the shortest total synthesis of a pseudopterosin so far.

Tuning underwater adhesion with cation–π interactions

Cation–π interactions drive the self-assembly and cohesion of many biological molecules, including the adhesion proteins of several marine organisms. Although the origin of cation–π bonds in isolated pairs has been extensively studied, the energetics of cation–π-driven self-assembly in molecular films remains uncharted. Here we use nanoscale force measurements in combination with solid-state NMR spectroscopy to show that the cohesive properties of simple aromatic- and lysine-rich peptides rival those of the strong reversible intermolecular cohesion exhibited by adhesion proteins of marine mussel. In particular, we show that peptides incorporating the amino acid phenylalanine, a functional group that is conspicuously sparing in the sequences of mussel proteins, exhibit reversible adhesion interactions significantly exceeding that of analogous mussel-mimetic peptides. More broadly, we demonstrate that interfacial confinement fundamentally alters the energetics of cation–π-mediated assembly: an insight that should prove relevant for diverse areas, which range from rationalizing biological assembly to engineering peptide-based biomaterials. Cation–π interactions are critical for the adhesion proteins of marine organisms, yet the energetics of cation–π interactions in underwater environments remains uncharted. Nanoscale force measurements and NMR spectroscopy reveal that interfacial confinement fundamentally alters the energetics of cation–π mediated assembly.

An eight-step gram-scale synthesis of (−)-jiadifenolide

Development of a biologically active secondary metabolite into a useful medicine requires continuous access to meaningful quantities of material. Although any chemical synthesis is broadly useful for its versatility, identification of a synthesis route that can be economically scaled represents a greater challenge. Here we report a concise synthesis of the neurotrophic trace metabolite (−)-jiadifenolide and its production on a gram-scale. The brevity of the route and the structural similarity of a key intermediate to many potent Illicium terpenes make chemical synthesis the unquestionable method for accessing and modifying these potential therapeutics. A chemical synthesis of (–)-jiadifenolide, a small molecule neurotrophin, has been achieved in eight steps. The route relies on a stereoselective coupling of two simple butenolides to build the entire skeleton in a single step and produce one gram of the target for broad distribution to the biomedical community.

Optically pure, water-stable metallo-helical ‘flexicate’ assemblies with antibiotic activity

The helicates—chiral assemblies of two or more metal atoms linked by short or relatively rigid multidentate organic ligands—may be regarded as non-peptide mimetics of α-helices because they are of comparable size and have shown some relevant biological activity. Unfortunately, these beautiful helical compounds have remained difficult to use in the medicinal arena because they contain mixtures of isomers, cannot be optimized for specific purposes, are insoluble, or are too difficult to synthesize. Instead, we have now prepared thermodynamically stable single enantiomers of monometallic units connected by organic linkers. Our highly adaptable self-assembly approach enables the rapid preparation of ranges of water-stable, helicate-like compounds with high stereochemical purity. One such iron(II) ‘flexicate’ system exhibits specific interactions with DNA, promising antimicrobial activity against a Gram-positive bacterium (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA252), but also, unusually, a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli, MC4100), as well as low toxicity towards a non-mammalian model organism (Caenorhabditis elegans). The self-assembly of monometallic moieties with organic ligands has proved to be a highly versatile approach for preparing a range of metal–ligand assemblies that are helical, optically pure and stable in aqueous solutions. One such iron(II) ‘flexicate’ system exhibits significant interactions with DNA, as well as promising antimicrobial activity properties.

Layer-by-layer cell membrane assembly

Eukaryotic subcellular membrane systems, such as the nuclear envelope or endoplasmic reticulum, present a rich array of architecturally and compositionally complex supramolecular targets that are as yet inaccessible. Here we describe layer-by-layer phospholipid membrane assembly on microfluidic droplets, a route to structures with defined compositional asymmetry and lamellarity. Starting with phospholipid-stabilized water-in-oil droplets trapped in a static droplet array, lipid monolayer deposition proceeds as oil/water-phase boundaries pass over the droplets. Unilamellar vesicles assembled layer-by-layer support functional insertion both of purified and of in situ expressed membrane proteins. Synthesis and chemical probing of asymmetric unilamellar and double-bilayer vesicles demonstrate the programmability of both membrane lamellarity and lipid-leaflet composition during assembly. The immobilized vesicle arrays are a pragmatic experimental platform for biophysical studies of membranes and their associated proteins, particularly complexes that assemble and function in multilamellar contexts in vivo. Immobilized microfluidic water-in-oil droplets serve as templates for layer-by-layer deposition of lipid monolayers to create vesicles of programmable lamellarity and content. Arrays of vesicles allow reproducible assembly and multi-vesicle probing of complex membrane-associated parameters, such as permeability, asymmetry and membrane protein function.

Evolution of enzyme catalysts caged in biomimetic gel-shell beads

Natural evolution relies on the improvement of biological entities by rounds of diversification and selection. In the laboratory, directed evolution has emerged as a powerful tool for the development of new and improved biomolecules, but it is limited by the enormous workload and cost of screening sufficiently large combinatorial libraries. Here we describe the production of gel-shell beads (GSBs) with the help of a microfluidic device. These hydrogel beads are surrounded with a polyelectrolyte shell that encloses an enzyme, its encoding DNA and the fluorescent reaction product. Active clones in these man-made compartments can be identified readily by fluorescence-activated sorting at rates &gt;107 GSBs per hour. We use this system to perform the directed evolution of a phosphotriesterase (a bioremediation catalyst) caged in GSBs and isolate a 20-fold faster mutant in less than one hour. We thus establish a practically undemanding method for ultrahigh-throughput screening that results in functional hybrid composites endowed with evolvable protein components. Directed evolution has emerged as a powerful tool for the identification of improved enzyme catalysts. Now, gel-shell beads are introduced as compartments that cage an enzyme with its encoding DNA, constituting a new genotype–phenotype linkage. Screening of 107 gel-shell beads by flow cytometry leads to an improved phosphotriesterase bioremediation catalyst.

Observation of the isotope effect in sub-kelvin reactions

Quantum phenomena in the translational motion of reactants, which are usually negligible at room temperature, can dominate reaction dynamics at low temperatures. In such cold conditions, even the weak centrifugal force is enough to create a potential barrier that keeps reactants separated. However, reactions may still proceed through tunnelling because, at low temperatures, wave-like properties become important. At certain de Broglie wavelengths, the colliding particles can become trapped in long-lived metastable scattering states, leading to sharp increases in the total reaction rate. Here, we show that these metastable states are responsible for a dramatic, order-of-magnitude-strong, quantum kinetic isotope effect by measuring the absolute Penning ionization reaction rates between hydrogen isotopologues and metastable helium down to 0.01&nbsp;K. We demonstrate that measurements of a single isotope are insufficient to constrain ab initio calculations, making the kinetic isotope effect in the cold regime necessary to remove ambiguity among possible potential energy surfaces. In cold chemistry, quantum phenomena in reactants' translational motion lead to the temporary trapping of reactants in a collisional complex. It is now shown that this metastable complex is responsible for a dramatic quantum kinetic isotope effect as observed in Penning ionization reactions at low temperatures.

Direct observation of subpicosecond vibrational dynamics in photoexcited myoglobin

Determining the initial pathway for ultrafast energy redistribution within biomolecules is a challenge, and haem proteins, for which energy can be deposited locally in the haem moiety using short light pulses, are suitable model systems to address this issue. However, data acquired using existing experimental techniques that fail to combine sufficient structural sensitivity with adequate time resolution have resulted in alternative hypotheses concerning the interplay between energy flow among highly excited vibrational levels and potential concomitant electronic processes. By developing a femtosecond-stimulated Raman set-up, endowed with the necessary tunability to take advantage of different resonance conditions, here we visualize the temporal evolution of energy redistribution over different vibrational modes in myoglobin. We establish that the vibrational energy initially stored in the highly excited Franck–Condon manifold is transferred with different timescales into low- and high-frequency modes, prior to slow dissipation through the protein. These findings demonstrate that a newly proposed mechanism involving the population dynamics of specific vibrational modes settles the controversy on the existence of transient electronic intermediates. Difficulties in experimentally achieving simultaneous structural sensitivity and time resolution have hindered the real-time mapping of the vibrational energy relaxation pathways in biomacromolecules. Now, using ultrashort light pulses to locally deposit excess energy in a protein-bound haem, the temporal evolution of the subsequent energy flow has been monitored, unravelling vibrational couplings that lead to mode-specific temperature changes.

Controlling intramolecular hydrogen transfer in a porphycene molecule with single atoms or molecules located nearby

Although the local environment of a molecule can play an important role in its chemistry, rarely has it been examined experimentally at the level of individual molecules. Here we report the precise control of intramolecular hydrogen-transfer (tautomerization) reactions in single molecules using scanning tunnelling microscopy. By placing, with atomic precision, a copper adatom close to a porphycene molecule, we found that the tautomerization rates could be tuned up and down in a controlled fashion, surprisingly also at rather large separations. Furthermore, we extended our study to molecular assemblies in which even the arrangement of the pyrrolic hydrogen atoms in the neighbouring molecule influences the tautomerization reaction in a given porphycene, with positive and negative cooperativity effects. Our results highlight the importance of controlling the environment of molecules with atomic precision and demonstrate the potential to regulate processes that occur in a single molecule. The rate of an intramolecular hydrogen transfer reaction in a single porphycene molecule resting on a copper surface can be controlled by placing a copper adatom close to it. Cooperativity effects are also observed in rows of porphycene molecules, where the reaction rate of each individual molecule depends on the precise tautomer state of its neighbours.

Diverse sp3 C−H functionalization through alcohol β-sulfonyloxylation

Site-selective C−H functionalization has emerged as an attractive tool for derivatizing complex synthetic intermediates, but its use for late-stage diversification is limited by the functional groups that can be introduced, especially at unactivated sp3-hybridized positions. To overcome this, we introduce a strategy that directly installs a sulfonyloxy group at a β-C−H bond of a masked alcohol and subsequently employs nucleophilic substitution reactions to prepare various derivatives. Hydroxyl groups are widely found in bioactive molecules and are thus readily available as synthetic handles. A directing group is easily added (and subsequently removed) from the alcohols such that a formal site-selective β-C−H sulfonyloxylation of these alcohols is achieved. Substitution reactions with carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and other nucleophiles then lead to diverse functionalizations that may help to streamline the synthesis of complex analogues for drug discovery. The late-stage functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds could be useful for the rapid development of structure–activity relationships, but highly target-specific conditions make it challenging. Now, a strategy for the preparation of a variety of β-functionalized alcohol derivatives through a site-selective C−H sulfonyloxylation and subsequent SN2 reactions is described.

Reversible Bergman cyclization by atomic manipulation

The Bergman cyclization is one of the most fascinating rearrangements in chemistry, with important implications in organic synthesis and pharmacology. Here we demonstrate a reversible Bergman cyclization for the first time. We induced the on-surface transformation of an individual aromatic diradical into a highly strained ten-membered diyne using atomic manipulation and verified the products by non-contact atomic force microscopy with atomic resolution. The diyne and diradical were stabilized by using an ultrathin NaCl film as the substrate, and the diyne could be transformed back into the diradical. Importantly, the diradical and the diyne exhibit different reactivity, electronic, magnetic and optical properties associated with the changes in the bond topology, and spin multiplicity. With this reversible, triggered Bergman cyclization we demonstrated switching on demand between the two reactive intermediates by means of selective C–C bond formation or cleavage, which opens up the field of radical chemistry for on-surface reactions by atomic manipulation. The Bergman cyclization is a fascinating rearrangement reaction with implications beyond organic chemistry. It has now been shown that a reversible Bergman cyclization reaction in a single molecule sitting on an ultrathin NaCl film can be triggered and directly imaged using atomic force microscopy. The interconverted diradical and diyne products are shown to have distinct chemical and physical properties.

Controlling and imaging biomimetic self-assembly

The self-assembly of chemical entities represents a very attractive way to create a large variety of ordered functional structures and complex matter. Although much effort has been devoted to the preparation of supramolecular nanostructures based on different chemical building blocks, an understanding of the mechanisms at play and the ability to monitor assembly processes and, in turn, control them are often elusive, which precludes a deep and comprehensive control of the final structures. Here the complex supramolecular landscape of a platinum(II) compound is characterized fully and controlled successfully through a combination of supramolecular and photochemical approaches. The supramolecular assemblies comprise two kinetic assemblies and their thermodynamic counterpart. The monitoring of the different emission properties of the aggregates, used as a fingerprint for each species, allows the real-time visualization of the evolving self-assemblies. The control of multiple supramolecular pathways will help the design of complex systems in and out of their thermodynamic equilibrium. The self-assembly of building blocks is an enticing route towards functional materials, yet understanding and controlling the mechanisms at play has remained challenging. Now the different morphologies and emission colours of the aggregates of a platinum(II) compound has enabled its assembly pathways into different structures to be controlled and visualized in real time.

Enantioselective preparation and chemoselective cross-coupling of 1,1-diboron compounds

The simplicity, efficiency and generality of the transition-metal-catalysed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction has led to its application in the preparation of a wide variety of organic compounds. Cross-coupling of alkylboron derivatives, however, remains a major challenge, in particular with regard to stereochemical control. Here, we describe the preparation and reaction of highly optically enriched 1,1-diboron compounds. A catalytic asymmetric conjugate borylation of β-boronylacrylates provided geminal diboronate products that feature two distinct boronyl units, in 99% enantiomeric excess. Chemoselective cross-coupling of one-boronyl unit, a trifluoroborate salt, occurred stereospecifically via inversion of its configuration to generate enantioenriched benzylic or allylic boronates. The difficult transmetallation in the Suzuki–Miyaura catalytic reaction cycle is believed to be facilitated by a stabilization effect from the second boronyl unit, and internal coordination by the oxygen of the proximal carboxyester. We also explored subsequent functionalization of the second boronyl unit. Stereoselective Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions involving non-benzylic secondary alkylboronates are notoriously challenging. Here, an enantioselective synthesis of 1,1-diboronyl compounds using asymmetric conjugate borylation, followed by chemoselective mono cross-coupling with inversion at the diboron centre, is used to produce highly enantioenriched benzylic or allylic boronates, which themselves are useful reagents for a number of processes.

Ion-paired chiral ligands for asymmetric palladium catalysis

Conventional chiral ligands rely on the use of a covalently constructed, single chiral molecule embedded with coordinative functional groups. Here, we report a new strategy for the design of a chiral ligand for asymmetric transition-metal catalysis; our approach is based on the development of an achiral cationic ammonium–phosphine hybrid ligand paired with a chiral binaphtholate anion. This ion-paired chiral ligand imparts a remarkable stereocontrolling ability to its palladium complex, which catalyses a highly enantioselective allylic alkylation of α-nitrocarboxylates. By exploiting the possible combinations of the achiral onium entities with suitable coordinative functionalities and readily available chiral acids, this approach should contribute to the development of a broad range of metal-catalysed, stereoselective chemical transformations. Rather than create a chiral catalyst by combining a chiral ligand with a metal, here an achiral phosphine ligand endowed with a cationic ammonium group is ion-paired with a chiral binaphtholate. A palladium catalyst based on this strategy is shown to be effective for highly enantioselective allylic alkylation of α-nitrocarboxylates.

Chemically homogeneous and thermally reversible oxidation of epitaxial graphene

With its exceptional charge mobility, graphene holds great promise for applications in next-generation electronics. In an effort to tailor its properties and interfacial characteristics, the chemical functionalization of graphene is being actively pursued. The oxidation of graphene via the Hummers method is most widely used in current studies, although the chemical inhomogeneity and irreversibility of the resulting graphene oxide compromises its use in high-performance devices. Here, we present an alternative approach for oxidizing epitaxial graphene using atomic oxygen in ultrahigh vacuum. Atomic-resolution characterization with scanning tunnelling microscopy is quantitatively compared to density functional theory, showing that ultrahigh-vacuum oxidization results in uniform epoxy functionalization. Furthermore, this oxidation is shown to be fully reversible at temperatures as low as 260&nbsp;°C using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. In this manner, ultrahigh-vacuum oxidation overcomes the limitations of Hummers-method graphene oxide, thus creating new opportunities for the study and application of chemically functionalized graphene. Graphene oxide produced via the standard Hummers method possesses a high degree of chemical inhomogeneity and limited reversibility. Now, it has been shown that an alternative ultra-high-vacuum approach for oxidizing epitaxial graphene yields uniform epoxy functionalization with thermal reversibility at temperatures as low as 260&nbsp;°C.

Anion-induced reconstitution of a self-assembling system to express a chloride-binding Co10L15 pentagonal prism

Biochemical systems are adaptable, capable of reconstitution at all levels to achieve the functions associated with life. Synthetic chemical systems are more limited in their ability to reorganize to achieve new functions; they can reconfigure to bind an added substrate (template effect) or one binding event may modulate a receptor's affinity for a second substrate (allosteric effect). Here we describe a synthetic chemical system that is capable of structural reconstitution on receipt of one anionic signal (perchlorate) to create a tight binding pocket for another anion (chloride). The complex, barrel-like structure of the chloride receptor is templated by five perchlorate anions. This second-order templation phenomenon allows chemical networks to be envisaged that express more complex responses to chemical signals than is currently feasible. A coordination cage has been prepared that self-assembles through second-order templation. Peripheral perchlorate or hexafluorophosphate template anions direct the formation of a hollow prism whose central pocket was able to bind a small anionic guest such as halide or azide, in a manner reminiscent to signal transduction in biological systems.

Organocatalytic stereoselective [8+2] and [6+4] cycloadditions

Cycloadditions that involve more than six π electrons are termed higher-order cycloadditions and are an excellent tool for solving complex synthetic challenges, as they provide direct access to polycyclic scaffolds that contain medium-sized rings. They have interesting synthetic potential for the discovery of new bioactive molecules and in natural product synthesis. It is peculiar that stereocontrolled [8+2] and [6+4] cycloadditions have been largely neglected for the past 50 years. Here we demonstrate a cross-dienamine activation of 2-cyclopentenone and the unprecedented endocyclic linear-dienamine activation of 2-cyclohexenones and 2-cycloheptenones. These dienamine intermediates undergo aminocatalytic stereoselective [8+2], [6+4] and formal [4+2] cycloadditions with various heptafulvenes. The periselectivities of the cycloadditions are controlled based on the ring size of the 2-cycloalkenones and the substitution patterns of the heptafulvenes. The chiral products obtained undergo various chemical and photochemical single-step transformations that give access to other classes of all-carbon polycyclic scaffolds. Higher-order cycloadditions — cycloadditions involving more than six π electrons — provide easy access to complex molecules containing heterocyclic or carbocyclic scaffolds. Now, it has been shown that aminocatalytic activation of 2-cycloalkenones affords mixtures of dienamines that can undergo [6 + 4] cycloadditions with heptafulvenes through a cross dienamine, or [8 + 2] cycloadditions through a linear dienamine.

Title: 
A protein-targeting strategy used to develop a selective inhibitor of the E17K point mutation in the PH domain of Akt1

Ligands that can bind selectively to proteins with single amino-acid point mutations offer the potential to detect or treat an abnormal protein in the presence of the wild type (WT). However, it is difficult to develop a selective ligand if the point mutation is not associated with an addressable location, such as a binding pocket. Here we report an all-chemical synthetic epitope-targeting strategy that we used to discover a 5-mer peptide with selectivity for the E17K-transforming point mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain of the Akt1 oncoprotein. A fragment of Akt1 that contained the E17K mutation and an I19[propargylglycine] substitution was synthesized to form an addressable synthetic epitope. Azide-presenting peptides that clicked covalently onto this alkyne-presenting epitope were selected from a library using in situ screening. One peptide exhibits a 10:1 in vitro selectivity for the oncoprotein relative to the WT, with a similar selectivity in cells. This 5-mer peptide was expanded into a larger ligand that selectively blocks the E17K Akt1 interaction with its PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate) substrate. It is difficult to develop a selective ligand for point mutations in proteins that are not found in easily addressable locations. Now, an all-chemical, epitope-targeting strategy has been reported, and was used to discover an inhibitory peptide with selectivity for the E17K point mutation in the PH Domain of the Akt1 oncoprotein.

Title: 
The structure and binding mode of citrate in the stabilization of gold nanoparticles

Elucidating the binding mode of carboxylate-containing ligands to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is crucial to understand their stabilizing role. A detailed picture of the three-dimensional structure and coordination modes of citrate, acetate, succinate and glutarate to AuNPs is obtained by 13C and 23Na solid-state NMR in combination with computational modelling and electron microscopy. The binding between the carboxylates and the AuNP surface is found to occur in three different modes. These three modes are simultaneously present at low citrate to gold ratios, while a monocarboxylate monodentate (1κO1) mode is favoured at high citrate:gold ratios. The surface AuNP atoms are found to be predominantly in the zero oxidation state after citrate coordination, although trace amounts of Auδ+ are observed. 23Na NMR experiments show that Na+ ions are present near the gold surface, indicating that carboxylate binding occurs as a 2e− L-type interaction for each oxygen atom involved. This approach has broad potential to probe the binding of a variety of ligands to metal nanoparticles. The manner in which carboxylates bind to the surface of nanoparticles has been an important question in materials science. Now, multinuclear magnetic resonance experiments — alongside DFT calculations, XPS and TEM measurements — have elucidated the three-dimensional ligand structures of gold nanoparticles capped with various ratios of carboxylate-containing ligands, and enabled the determination of the most probable binding modes.

Title: 
Self-powered enzyme micropumps

Non-mechanical nano- and microscale pumps that function without the aid of an external power source and provide precise control over the flow rate in response to specific signals are needed for the development of new autonomous nano- and microscale systems. Here we show that surface-immobilized enzymes that are independent of adenosine triphosphate function as self-powered micropumps in the presence of their respective substrates. In the four cases studied (catalase, lipase, urease and glucose oxidase), the flow is driven by a gradient in fluid density generated by the enzymatic reaction. The pumping velocity increases with increasing substrate concentration and reaction rate. These rechargeable pumps can be triggered by the presence of specific analytes, which enables the design of enzyme-based devices that act both as sensor and pump. Finally, we show proof-of-concept enzyme-powered devices that autonomously deliver small molecules and proteins in response to specific chemical stimuli, including the release of insulin in response to glucose. Self-powered micropumps that are turned on by the presence of their respective substrates are formed from surface-immobilized, ATP-independent enzymes. Coupling substrate-sensing with transport enables the design of devices that deliver cargo in response to specific stimuli. Demonstrated here is the release of insulin at a rate proportional to ambient glucose concentration.

Title: 
Charge-compensation in 3d-transition-metal-oxide intercalation cathodes through the generation of localized electron holes on oxygen

During the charging and discharging of lithium-ion-battery cathodes through the de- and reintercalation of lithium ions, electroneutrality is maintained by transition-metal redox chemistry, which limits the charge that can be stored. However, for some transition-metal oxides this limit can be broken and oxygen loss and/or oxygen redox reactions have been proposed to explain the phenomenon. We present operando mass spectrometry of 18O-labelled Li1.2[Ni0.132+Co0.133+Mn0.544+]O2, which demonstrates that oxygen is extracted from the lattice on charging a Li1.2[Ni0.132+Co0.133+Mn0.544+]O2 cathode, although we detected no O2 evolution. Combined soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that, in addition to oxygen loss, Li+ removal is charge compensated by the formation of localized electron holes on O atoms coordinated by Mn4+ and Li+ ions, which serve to promote the localization, and not the formation, of true O22− (peroxide, O–O ~1.45 Å) species. The quantity of charge compensated by oxygen removal and by the formation of electron holes on the O atoms is estimated, and for the case described here the latter dominates. The energy that can be stored in lithium-ion batteries is typically limited by the redox chemistry of the transition metals within the cathodes. Now it is shown that for Li1.2[Ni2+0.13Co3+0.13Mn4+0.54]O2, a 3d-transition-metal oxide that breaks this limit, Li-ion extraction is charge compensated not just by transition-metal oxidation but also through the generation of localized electron-holes on oxygen.

Title: 
Exceptional oxidation activity with size-controlled supported gold clusters of low atomicity

The catalytic activity of gold depends on particle size, with the reactivity increasing as the particle diameter decreases. However, investigations into behaviour in the subnanometre regime (where gold exists as small clusters of a few atoms) began only recently with advances in synthesis and characterization techniques. Here we report an easy method to prepare isolated gold atoms supported on functionalized carbon nanotubes and their performance in the oxidation of thiophenol with O2. We show that single gold atoms are not active, but they aggregate under reaction conditions into gold clusters of low atomicity that exhibit a catalytic activity comparable to that of sulfhydryl oxidase enzymes. When clusters grow into larger nanoparticles, catalyst activity drops to zero. Theoretical calculations show that gold clusters are able to activate thiophenol and O2 simultaneously, and larger nanoparticles are passivated by strongly adsorbed thiolates. The combination of both reactants activation and facile product desorption makes gold clusters excellent catalysts. The catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles is known to be dependent on size, but less is known about the activity of even smaller gold clusters. It is now shown that clusters with 5 to 10 atoms supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes are as active as enzymes for the oxidation of thiophenol to disulfide with O2.

Title: 
Direct catalytic cross-coupling of organolithium compounds

Catalytic carbon–carbon bond formation based on cross-coupling reactions plays a central role in the production of natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and organic materials. Coupling reactions of a variety of organometallic reagents and organic halides have changed the face of modern synthetic chemistry. However, the high reactivity and poor selectivity of common organolithium reagents have largely prohibited their use as a viable partner in direct catalytic cross-coupling. Here we report that in the presence of a Pd-phosphine catalyst, a wide range of alkyl-, aryl- and heteroaryl-lithium reagents undergo selective cross-coupling with aryl- and alkenyl-bromides. The process proceeds quickly under mild conditions (room temperature) and avoids the notorious lithium halogen exchange and homocoupling. The preparation of key alkyl-, aryl- and heterobiaryl intermediates reported here highlights the potential of these cross-coupling reactions for medicinal chemistry and material science. A general and selective palladium-catalysed cross-coupling of aryl- and alkenyl-bromides with a wide range of alkyl-, aryl- and heteroaryl-lithium reagents is reported. The process proceeds quickly at room temperature, and avoids the notorious lithium–halogen exchange and homocoupling side-reactions commonly associated with these extremely reactive organometallic compounds.

Imaging the intracellular distribution of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in living cells with quantitative hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering

ABL1 tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) are front-line therapy for chronic myelogenous leukaemia and are among the best-known examples of targeted cancer therapeutics. However, the dynamic uptake into cells of TKIs of low molecular weight and their intracellular behaviour is unknown because of the difficulty of observing non-fluorescent small molecules at subcellular resolution. Here we report the direct label-free visualization and quantification of two TKI drugs (imatinib and nilotinib) inside living cells using hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging. Concentrations of both drugs were enriched over 1,000-fold in lysosomes as a result of their lysosomotropic properties. In addition, low solubility appeared to contribute significantly to the surprisingly large accumulation of nilotinib. We further show that the lysosomal trapping of imatinib was reduced more than tenfold when chloroquine is used simultaneously, which suggests that chloroquine may increase the efficacy of TKIs through lysosome-mediated drug–drug interaction in addition to the commonly proposed autophagy-inhibition mechanism. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) are amongst the best known examples of targeted cancer therapeutics. Now, using hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging, the label-free visualization and quantification of two TKI drugs inside living cells is reported. Significant trapping of TKI drugs in lysosomes was observed, which can be reversed by co-treatment with chloroquine through lysosome-mediated interactions.

Synthesis of ent-BE-43547A1 reveals a potent hypoxia-selective anticancer agent and uncovers the biosynthetic origin of the APD-CLD natural products

Tumour hypoxia is speculated to be a key driver of therapeutic resistance and metastatic dissemination. Consequently, the discovery of new potent agents that selectively target the hypoxic cell population may reveal new and untapped antitumour mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that the BE-43547 subclass of the APD-CLD (amidopentadienoate-containing cyclolipodepsipeptides) natural products possesses highly hypoxia-selective growth-inhibitory activity against pancreatic cancer cells. To enable this discovery, we have developed the first synthesis of the BE-43547-macrocyclic scaffold in 16 steps (longest linear sequence), which also allowed access to the full panel of relative stereoisomers and ultimately to the assignment of stereochemical configuration. Discrepancies between the spectroscopic signatures of the synthetic compounds with that originally reported for the BE-43547 members stimulated us to re-isolate the natural product from a BE-43547-producing microorganism during which we elucidated the biosynthetic gene clusters for the BE-43547 family as well as for all other known APD-CLDs. Our studies underline the exciting possibilities for the further development of the anticancer activities of these natural products. Anti-proliferative compounds that display enhanced toxicity in a low-oxygen (hypoxic) environment may be used to eradicate aggressive and therapy-resistant cancer cells. Now, a promising lead structure has been identified in the BE-43547-class of depsipeptide natural products.

Unidirectional rotary motion in achiral molecular motors

Control of the direction of motion is an essential feature of biological rotary motors and results from the intrinsic chirality of the amino acids from which the motors are made. In synthetic autonomous light-driven rotary motors, point chirality is transferred to helical chirality, and this governs their unidirectional rotation. However, achieving directional rotary motion in an achiral molecular system in an autonomous fashion remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report an achiral molecular motor in which the presence of a pseudo-asymmetric carbon atom proved to be sufficient for exclusive autonomous disrotary motion of two appended rotor moieties. Isomerization around the two double bonds enables both rotors to move in the same direction with respect to their surroundings—like wheels on an axle—demonstrating that autonomous unidirectional rotary motion can be achieved in a symmetric system. Avoiding equal probability for clockwise and anticlockwise rotation is essential for the function of molecular motors, and both biological and synthetic systems take advantage of chirality to control the rotary direction. Now it has been shown, by integrating two rotor moieties in a symmetric meso motor design, that light-driven unidirectional rotary motion can be achieved in an achiral system.

Photoswitching of glass transition temperatures of azobenzene-containing polymers induces reversible solid-to-liquid transitions

The development of polymers with switchable glass transition temperatures (Tg) can address scientific challenges such as the healing of cracks in high-Tg polymers and the processing of hard polymers at room temperature without using plasticizing solvents. Here, we demonstrate that light can switch the Tg of azobenzene-containing polymers (azopolymers) and induce reversible solid-to-liquid transitions of the polymers. The azobenzene groups in the polymers exhibit reversible cis–trans photoisomerization abilities. Trans azopolymers are solids with Tg above room temperature, whereas cis azopolymers are liquids with Tg below room temperature. Because of the photoinduced solid-to-liquid transitions of these polymers, light can reduce the surface roughness of azopolymer films by almost 600%, repeatedly heal cracks in azopolymers, and control the adhesion of azopolymers for transfer printing. The photoswitching of Tg provides a new strategy for designing healable polymers with high Tg and allows for control over the mechanical properties of polymers with high spatiotemporal resolution. Reversibly inducing solid-to-liquid transitions of polymers at room temperature represents a challenge for enhanced processability and applications of polymers. Now, three azopolymers have been shown to exhibit photoswitchable glass transition temperatures, resulting in reversible solid-to-liquid transitions. Light exposure can heal cracks in hard azopolymers, reduce surface roughness of azopolymer films and control azopolymer adhesion.

Covalent functionalization and passivation of exfoliated black phosphorus via aryl diazonium chemistry

Functionalization of atomically thin nanomaterials enables the tailoring of their chemical, optical and electronic properties. Exfoliated black phosphorus (BP)—a layered two-dimensional semiconductor—exhibits favourable charge-carrier mobility, tunable bandgap and highly anisotropic properties, but it is chemically reactive and degrades rapidly in ambient conditions. Here we show that covalent aryl diazonium functionalization suppresses the chemical degradation of exfoliated BP even after three weeks of ambient exposure. This chemical modification scheme spontaneously forms phosphorus–carbon bonds, has a reaction rate sensitive to the aryl diazonium substituent and alters the electronic properties of exfoliated BP, ultimately yielding a strong, tunable p-type doping that simultaneously improves the field-effect transistor mobility and on/off current ratio. This chemical functionalization pathway controllably modifies the properties of exfoliated BP, and thus improves its prospects for nanoelectronic applications. Few-layer black phosphorus (BP) is a promising semiconductor, but it is highly reactive and susceptible to ambient degradation. Covalent functionalization with aryl radicals has now been shown to significantly improve the stability of exfoliated BP, as well as the performance of BP-based electronic devices through a controllable p-type doping effect.

An improved high-performance lithium–air battery

Although dominating the consumer electronics markets as the power source of choice for popular portable devices, the common lithium battery is not yet suited for use in sustainable electrified road transport. The development of advanced, higher-energy lithium batteries is essential in the rapid establishment of the electric car market. Owing to its exceptionally high energy potentiality, the lithium–air battery is a very appealing candidate for fulfilling this role. However, the performance of such batteries has been limited to only a few charge–discharge cycles with low rate capability. Here, by choosing a suitable stable electrolyte and appropriate cell design, we demonstrate a lithium–air battery capable of operating over many cycles with capacity and rate values as high as 5,000&nbsp;mAh&nbsp;gcarbon−1 and 3&nbsp;A&nbsp;gcarbon−1, respectively. For this battery we estimate an energy density value that is much higher than those offered by the currently available lithium-ion battery technology. Lithium–air batteries have the possibility of having a very high energy density, but their use has been hampered by a limited number of charge–discharge cycles and a low current-rate capability. Now, exploiting a suitable, stable electrolyte allows an advanced lithium–air battery to operate with many cycles at various capacity and rate values.

An N-bridged high-valent diiron–oxo species on a porphyrin platform that can oxidize methane

High-valent oxo–metal complexes are involved in key biochemical processes of selective oxidation and removal of xenobiotics. The catalytic properties of cytochrome P-450 and soluble methane monooxygenase enzymes are associated with oxo species on mononuclear iron haem and diiron non-haem platforms, respectively. Bio-inspired chemical systems that can reproduce the fascinating ability of these enzymes to oxidize the strongest C–H bonds are the focus of intense scrutiny. In this context, the development of highly oxidizing diiron macrocyclic catalysts requires a structural determination of the elusive active species and elucidation of the reaction mechanism. Here we report the preparation of an Fe(IV)(µ-nitrido)Fe(IV) = O tetraphenylporphyrin cation radical species at −90&nbsp;°C, characterized by ultraviolet–visible, electron paramagnetic resonance and Mössbauer spectroscopies and by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This species exhibits a very high activity for oxygen-atom transfer towards alkanes, including methane. These findings provide a foundation on which to develop efficient and clean oxidation processes, in particular transformations of the strongest C–H bonds. A short-lived diiron–oxo species — based on a nitrido-bridged bis-porphyrin 1 1platform — capable of efficiently oxidizing the strongest of C–H bonds has been prepared and spectroscopically characterized. The catalytic properties of this high-valent diiron(IV)–oxo complex were elucidated by studying the oxidation kinetics of a range of alkanes.

Self-assembled molecular p/n junctions for applications in dye-sensitized solar energy conversion

The achievement of long-lived photoinduced redox separation lifetimes has long been a central goal of molecular-based solar energy conversion strategies. The longer the redox-separation lifetime, the more time available for useful work to be extracted from the absorbed photon energy. Here we describe a novel strategy for dye-sensitized solar energy applications in which redox-separated lifetimes on the order of milliseconds to seconds can be achieved based on a simple toolkit of molecular components. Specifically, molecular chromophores (C), electron acceptors (A) and electron donors (D) were self-assembled on the surfaces of mesoporous, transparent conducting indium tin oxide nanoparticle (nanoITO) electrodes to prepare both photoanode (nanoITO|–A–C–D) and photocathode (nanoITO|–D–C–A) assemblies. Nanosecond transient-absorption and steady-state photolysis measurements show that the electrodes function microscopically as molecular analogues of semiconductor p/n junctions. These results point to a new chemical strategy for dye-sensitized solar energy conversion based on molecular excited states and electron acceptors/donors on the surfaces of transparent conducting oxide nanoparticle electrodes. A primary objective in solar energy conversion is to achieve long-lived light-driven redox separation. Now a modular self-assembly strategy has been developed to construct molecular p/n junctions surface-bound to transparent conducting ITO nanoparticle electrodes. Both photoanode and photocathode assemblies achieved remarkably long-lived redox separation lifetimes without making use of traditional wide-bandgap semiconductors.

Synthetic fermentation of bioactive non-ribosomal peptides without organisms, enzymes or reagents

Microbial fermentation can rapidly provide potent compounds that can be easily screened for biological activity, and the active components can be isolated. Its success in drug discovery has inspired extensive efforts to modulate and control the products. In this Article, we document a ‘synthetic fermentation’ of bioactive, unnatural peptides ‘grown’ from small building blocks in water using amide-forming ligations. No organisms, enzymes or reagents are needed. The sequences, structures and compositions of the products can be modulated by adjusting the building blocks and conditions. No specialized knowledge of organic chemistry or handling of toxic material is required to produce complex organic molecules. The ‘fermentations’ can be conducted in arrays and screened for biological activity without isolation or workup. As a proof-of-concept, about 6,000 unnatural peptides were produced from just 23 building blocks, from which a hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration of 1.0 μM was identified and characterized. The production of biologically active compounds by microbial fermentation has proved highly successful in drug discovery. Now, a method that mimics this process has been used to prepare unnatural peptides from small building blocks without the need for additional reagents, and in a fashion that is immediately compatible with biological screening.

Hypersensitive dual-function luminescence switching of a silver-chalcogenolate cluster-based metal–organic framework

Silver(i) chalcogenide/chalcogenolate clusters are promising photofunctional materials for sensing, optoelectronics and solar energy harvesting applications. However, their instability and poor room-temperature luminescent quantum yields have hampered more extensive study. Here, we graft such clusters to adaptable bridging ligands, enabling their interconnection and the formation of rigid metal–organic frameworks. By controlling the spatial separation and orientation of the clusters, they then exhibit enhanced stability (over one year) and quantum yield (12.1%). Ultrafast dual-function fluorescence switching (&lt;1 s) is also achieved, with turn-off triggered by O2 and multicoloured turn-on by volatile organic compounds. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction of the inclusion materials, obtained by single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation, enables precise determination of the position of the small molecules within the framework, elucidating the switching mechanism. The work enriches the cluster-based metal–organic framework portfolio, bridges the gap between silver chalcogenide/chalcogenolate clusters and metal–organic frameworks, and provides a foundation for further development of functional silver-cluster-based materials. The properties of discrete species can sometimes be improved by fixing them into extended materials. This strategy has now been applied to silver(I) chalcogenide/chalcogenolate clusters, resulting in a metal–organic framework with enhanced stability and fluorescent sensing capabilities. Crystallographic analysis allows precise structural determination of guest binding, which is responsible for both emission turn-off and multicoloured turn-on.

Photocurrent generation based on a light-driven proton pump in an artificial liquid membrane

Biological light-driven proton pumps use light to move protons across a cell membrane, creating a proton gradient. Although photochromic compounds such as spiropyrans can reversibly convert between two structures with differing pKa values, spiropyrans have not been used to generate either a light-driven proton pump or an electrical current. Here, we report an artificial light-harvesting system based on a supported liquid membrane doped with a spiropyran. Irradiating the membrane with ultraviolet light induces a ring-opening reaction, converting spiropyran to merocyanine, whereas irradiation with visible light induces the reverse reaction. When the membrane is irradiated with ultraviolet and visible light on opposite sides, H+ is taken up by merocyanine, carried through the polymeric membrane and released on the other side. We show that this system produces a light-induced proton flux, an electrical current with an efficiency of ∼0.12%, an open-circuit voltage of ∼210&nbsp;mV and a membrane gradient of ∼3.6&nbsp;ΔpH units. Alternating the sides illuminated with ultraviolet and visible light generates an alternating current. Light-driven proton pumps are used in biology to create a proton gradient that can be subsequently converted into chemical energy. Here, an artificial light-harvesting system based on a membrane doped with a spiropyran is described. Irradiation with UV light generates a proton flux across the membrane and results in the generation of an electrical current.

Halogen bonding in water results in enhanced anion recognition in acyclic and rotaxane hosts

Halogen bonding (XB), the attractive interaction between an electron-deficient halogen atom and a Lewis base, has undergone a dramatic development as an intermolecular force analogous to hydrogen bonding (HB). However, its utilization in the solution phase remains underdeveloped. Furthermore, the design of receptors capable of strong and selective recognition of anions in water remains a significant challenge. Here we demonstrate the superiority of halogen bonding over hydrogen bonding for strong anion binding in water, to the extent that halide recognition by a simple acyclic mono-charged receptor is achievable. Quantification of iodide binding by rotaxane hosts reveals the strong binding by the XB-rotaxane is driven exclusively by favourable enthalpic contributions arising from the halogen-bonding interactions, whereas weaker association with the HB-rotaxanes is entropically driven. These observations demonstrate the unique nature of halogen bonding in water as a strong alternative interaction to the ubiquitous hydrogen bonding in molecular recognition and assembly. The ability to achieve strong molecular recognition in water is a key challenge for supramolecular chemistry. Now, halogen bonding — the attractive interaction between an electron-deficient halogen atom and a Lewis base — has been shown to be superior to hydrogen bonding for strong anion binding in water.

Functional RNAs exhibit tolerance for non-heritable 2′–5′ versus 3′–5′ backbone heterogeneity

A plausible process for non-enzymatic RNA replication would greatly simplify models of the transition from prebiotic chemistry to simple biology. However, all known conditions for the chemical copying of an RNA template result in the synthesis of a complementary strand that contains a mixture of 2′–5′ and 3′–5′ linkages, rather than the selective synthesis of only 3′–5′ linkages as found in contemporary RNA. Here we show that such backbone heterogeneity is compatible with RNA folding into defined three-dimensional structures that retain molecular recognition and catalytic properties and, therefore, would not prevent the evolution of functional RNAs such as ribozymes. Moreover, the same backbone heterogeneity lowers the melting temperature of RNA duplexes that would otherwise be too stable for thermal strand separation. By allowing copied strands to dissociate, this heterogeneity may have been one of the essential features that allowed RNA to emerge as the first biopolymer. An RNA aptamer and a ribozyme are both observed to retain a surprising degree of activity despite backbone heterogeneity caused by the presence of non-natural 2′–5′ phosphodiester linkages. These results suggest that absolute regioselectivity of non-enzymatic replication may not have been required for the emergence of RNA as the first biopolymer.

Protonation-coupled redox reactions in planar antiaromatic meso-pentafluorophenyl-substituted o-phenylene-bridged annulated rosarins

Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes are among the most important phenomena that control a variety of chemical and biological transformations. Although extensively studied in a variety of natural systems and discrete metal complexes, PCET mechanisms are less well codified in the case of purely organic compounds. Here we report that a planar β,β′-phenylene-bridged hexaphyrin (1.0.1.0.1.0), a 24 π-electron antiaromatic species termed rosarin, displays unique redox reactivity on protonation. Specifically, treatment with acid (for example, HI) yields a 26 π-electron aromatic triprotonated monocationic species that is produced spontaneously via an intermediate—but stable—25 π-electron non-aromatic triprotonated monoradical dication. This latter species is also produced on treatment of the original 24 π-electron antiaromatic starting material with HCl or HBr. The stepwise nature of the proton-coupled reduction observed in the planar rosarin stands in marked contrast to that seen for non-annulated rosarins and other ostensibly antiaromatic expanded porphyrinoids. A 24 π-electron antiaromatic hexaphyrin derivative (rosarin) with a near-planar geometry enforced by bridging phenylene groups has been shown to undergo a proton-coupled electron transfer reduction when treated with certain protic acids. The reduction proceeds in a stepwise fashion to give first a 25 π-electron non-aromatic system and then a 26 π-electron aromatic ring.

Broken symmetry and the variation of critical properties in the phase behaviour of supramolecular rhombus tilings

The tiling of surfaces has long attracted the attention of scientists, not only because it is intriguing intrinsically, but also as a way to control the properties of surfaces. However, although random tiling networks are studied increasingly, their degree of randomness (or partial order) has remained notoriously difficult to control, in common with other supramolecular systems. Here we show that the random organization of a two-dimensional supramolecular array of isophthalate tetracarboxylic acids varies with subtle chemical changes in the system. We quantify this variation using an order parameter and reveal a phase behaviour that is consistent with long-standing theoretical studies on random tiling. The balance between order and randomness is driven by small differences in intermolecular interaction energies, which can be related by numerical simulations to the experimentally measured order parameter. Significant variations occur with very small energy differences, which highlights the delicate balance between entropic and energetic effects in complex self-assembly processes. Assembling random networks on a surface is an intriguing — and potentially useful — phenomenon, but partial order is difficult to control. Researchers have now altered two-dimensional tetracarboxylic acid networks through only small chemical changes. This phase behaviour reveals that entropy, alongside energy, plays a crucial role in the order–disorder balance.

A cascade reaction network mimicking the basic functional steps of adaptive immune response

Biological systems use complex ‘information-processing cores’ composed of molecular networks to coordinate their external environment and internal states. An example of this is the acquired, or adaptive, immune system (AIS), which is composed of both humoral and cell-mediated components. Here we report the step-by-step construction of a prototype mimic of the AIS that we call an adaptive immune response simulator (AIRS). DNA and enzymes are used as simple artificial analogues of the components of the AIS to create a system that responds to specific molecular stimuli in vitro. We show that this network of reactions can function in a manner that is superficially similar to the most basic responses of the vertebrate AIS, including reaction sequences that mimic both humoral and cellular responses. As such, AIRS provides guidelines for the design and engineering of artificial reaction networks and molecular devices. A cascade reaction network has been created that can function in a manner that is superficially similar to the most basic steps of the vertebrate adaptive immune response. This reaction network uses DNA and enzymes as simple artificial analogues of the components of the acquired immune system.

Title: 
A sequence-specific threading tetra-intercalator with an extremely slow dissociation rate constant

A long-lived and sequence-specific ligand–DNA complex would make possible the modulation of biological processes for extended periods. For this purpose, we are investigating a polyintercalation approach to DNA recognition in which flexible chains of aromatic units thread back and forth repeatedly through the double helix. Here we describe the DNA-binding behaviour of a threading tetra-intercalator. Specific binding was observed on a relatively long DNA strand that strongly favoured a predicted 14 base-pair sequence. Kinetic studies revealed a multistep association process, with sequence specificity that primarily derives from large differences in dissociation rates. The rate-limiting dissociation rate constant of the tetra-intercalator complex dissociating from its preferred binding site was extremely slow, corresponding to a half-life of 16 days. This is one of the longest non-covalent complex half-lives yet reported and, to the best of our knowledge, the longest for a DNA-binding molecule. Molecules that bind to DNA for extended periods can modulate its transcription or other biological processes. Kinetic studies on the non-covalent complex formed by a threading tetra-intercalator and a DNA double-helix have now revealed a multi-step association, and a particularly slow dissociation leading to sequence specificity and a 16-day half-life.

Title: 
Chiral information harvesting in dendritic metallopeptides

Long-range communication of stereochemical information is common in biological systems, particularly in enzyme-catalysed reactions. Here, we report the remote control of the dynamic chirality of metal centres, coordinated by 2,2′-bipyridine ligands bearing dynamic helical oligopeptides. The helical chirality of the oligopeptides is controlled by a stereocentre remote from the metal. We show that when a mixture of chiral and achiral peptide ligands is used, both the chirality of the metal centre and that of the achiral oligopeptide helices are significantly amplified. The amplification mechanism relies on several steps of chirality induction, first from a single chiral peptide to the helicity of an oligopeptide through the induction of propeller chirality at the metal centre, then on to induction of helical chirality in an achiral oligopeptide. 2,2′-bipyridine ligands coordinate to metals to form chiral propeller-like complexes. Now, this chirality is shown to be controlled by the coordination of 2,2′-bipyridine ligands that bear helical oligopeptides, which incorporate chiral amino acids at positions remote from the metal centre. This chirality is further translated, via the metal centre, to other achiral-oligopeptide-containing ligands.

Title: 
A molecular ruthenium catalyst with water-oxidation activity comparable to that of photosystem II

Across chemical disciplines, an interest in developing artificial water splitting to O2 and H2, driven by sunlight, has been motivated by the need for practical and environmentally friendly power generation without the consumption of fossil fuels. The central issue in light-driven water splitting is the efficiency of the water oxidation, which in the best-known catalysts falls short of the desired level by approximately two orders of magnitude. Here, we show that it is possible to close that ‘two orders of magnitude’ gap with a rationally designed molecular catalyst [Ru(bda)(isoq)2] (H2bda&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-dicarboxylic acid; isoq&nbsp;=&nbsp;isoquinoline). This speeds up the water oxidation to an unprecedentedly high reaction rate with a turnover frequency of &gt;300&nbsp;s−1. This value is, for the first time, moderately comparable with the reaction rate of 100–400&nbsp;s−1 of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II in vivo. Increasing the efficiency and speed of the water-oxidation reaction is crucial to realizing light-driven water splitting. Now, a mononuclear ruthenium complex achieves fast water-oxidation catalysis with a high reaction rate of more than 300 turnovers per second, comparable to the activity of the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II.

Title: 
Charged and metallic molecular monolayers through surface-induced aromatic stabilization

Large π-conjugated molecules, when in contact with a metal surface, usually retain a finite electronic gap and, in this sense, stay semiconducting. In some cases, however, the metallic character of the underlying substrate is seen to extend onto the first molecular layer. Here, we develop a chemical rationale for this intriguing phenomenon. In many reported instances, we find that the conjugation length of the organic semiconductors increases significantly through the bonding of specific substituents to the metal surface and through the concomitant rehybridization of the entire backbone structure. The molecules at the interface are thus converted into different chemical species with a strongly reduced electronic gap. This mechanism of surface-induced aromatic stabilization helps molecules to overcome competing phenomena that tend to keep the metal Fermi level between their frontier orbitals. Our findings aid in the design of stable precursors for metallic molecular monolayers, and thus enable new routes for the chemical engineering of metal surfaces. When monolayers of π-conjugated organic semiconductors interact with metal surfaces, most remain semiconducting. In some cases, however, the metallic character of the substrate is seen to extend onto the molecules. A mechanism for this intriguing phenomenon is now suggested and new strategies for chemical surface engineering are proposed.

Title: 
Template-directed covalent conjugation of DNA to native antibodies, transferrin and other metal-binding proteins

DNA–protein conjugates are important in bioanalytical chemistry, molecular diagnostics and bionanotechnology, as the DNA provides a unique handle to identify, functionalize or otherwise manipulate proteins. To maintain protein activity, conjugation of a single DNA handle to a specific location on the protein is often needed. However, preparing such high-quality site-specific conjugates often requires genetically engineered proteins, which is a laborious and technically challenging approach. Here we demonstrate a simpler method to create site-selective DNA–protein conjugates. Using a guiding DNA strand modified with a metal-binding functionality, we directed a second DNA strand to the vicinity of a metal-binding site of His6-tagged or wild-type metal-binding proteins, such as serotransferrin, where it subsequently reacted with lysine residues at that site. This method, DNA-templated protein conjugation, facilitates the production of site-selective protein conjugates, and also conjugation to IgG1 antibodies via a histidine cluster in the constant domain. Conjugation of DNA to proteins often involves a choice between either expressing recombinant proteins with a specific handle, or labelling wild-type proteins with low site-selectivity. Now preorganization of a DNA–ligand complex to a metal-binding site enables site-selective conjugation of a DNA strand to lysine residues of wild-type proteins and antibodies.

Title: 
Fluctuating exciton localization in giant π-conjugated spoked-wheel macrocycles

Conjugated polymers offer potential for many diverse applications, but we still lack a fundamental microscopic understanding of their electronic structure. Elementary photoexcitations (excitons) span only a few nanometres of a molecule, which itself can extend over microns, and how their behaviour is affected by molecular dimensions is not immediately obvious. For example, where is the exciton formed within a conjugated segment and is it always situated on the same repeat units? Here, we introduce structurally rigid molecular spoked wheels, 6&nbsp;nm in diameter, as a model of extended π conjugation. Single-molecule fluorescence reveals random exciton localization, which leads to temporally varying emission polarization. Initially, this random localization arises after every photon absorption event because of temperature-independent spontaneous symmetry breaking. These fast fluctuations are slowed to millisecond timescales after prolonged illumination. Intramolecular heterogeneity is revealed in cryogenic spectroscopy by jumps in transition energy, but emission polarization can also switch without a spectral jump occurring, which implies long-range homogeneity in the local dielectric environment. A deficiency in our molecular-level understanding of the electronic structure of conjugated polymers hinders their potential use in electronic applications. Shape-persistent highly ordered ring structures have been used to mimic conjugated polymers and have now been studied using single-molecule spectroscopy. The fundamentally non-deterministic nature of excitation energy localisation in π-conjugated macromolecules has been demonstrated.

Title: 
Enantioselective silyl protection of alcohols promoted by a combination of chiral and achiral Lewis basic catalysts

Catalytic enantioselective monosilylations of diols and polyols furnish valuable alcohol-containing molecules in high enantiomeric purity. These transformations, however, require high catalyst loadings (20–30&nbsp;mol%) and long reaction times (2–5 days). Here, we report that a counterintuitive strategy involving the use of an achiral co-catalyst structurally similar to the chiral catalyst provides an effective solution to this problem. A combination of seemingly competitive Lewis basic molecules can function in concert such that one serves as an achiral nucleophilic promoter and the other performs as a chiral Brønsted base. On the addition of 7.5–20&nbsp;mol% of a commercially available N-heterocycle (5-ethylthiotetrazole), reactions typically proceed within one hour, and deliver the desired products in high yields and enantiomeric ratios. In some instances, there is no reaction in the absence of the achiral base, yet the presence of the achiral co-catalyst gives rise to facile formation of products in high enantiomeric purity. A counter-intuitive strategy that combines a chiral Lewis base catalyst with an achiral Lewis base co-catalyst results in an exceptionally large increase in the facility of catalytic enantioselective silylation of polyols. The catalytic ensemble drives such reactions to completion within a few hours, rather than the usual two–five days, without loss of enantioselectivity.

Title: 
Single-molecule analysis of chirality in a multicomponent reaction network

Single-molecule approaches to chemical reaction analysis can provide information that is not accessible by studying ensemble systems. Changes in the molecular structures of compounds tethered to the inner wall of a protein pore are known to affect the current carried through the pore by aqueous ions under a fixed applied potential. Here, we use this approach to study the substitution reactions of arsenic(III) compounds with thiols, stretching the limits of the protein pore technology to track the interconversion of seven reaction components in a network that comprises interconnected Walden cycles. Single-molecule pathway analysis of ‘allowed’ and ‘forbidden’ reactions reveals that sulfur–sulfur substitution occurs with stereochemical inversion at the arsenic centre. Hence, we demonstrate that the nanoreactor approach can be a valuable technique for the analysis of dynamic reaction systems of relevance to biology. A nanoreactor approach has now been used to investigate the substitution reactions of arsenic(III) compounds with thiols at the single-molecule level. The rates of interconversion of seven reaction components are tracked, revealing the stereochemistry of sulfur–sulfur substitution at an arsenic centre.

Title: 
Quantitative sequencing of 5-formylcytosine in DNA at single-base resolution

Recently, the cytosine modifications 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-formylcytosine (5fC) were found to exist in the genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a wide range of mammalian cell types. It is now important to understand their role in normal biological function and disease. Here we introduce reduced bisulfite sequencing (redBS-Seq), a quantitative method to decode 5fC in DNA at single-base resolution, based on a selective chemical reduction of 5fC to 5hmC followed by bisulfite treatment. After extensive validation on synthetic and genomic DNA, we combined redBS-Seq and oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-Seq) to generate the first combined genomic map of 5-methylcytosine, 5hmC and 5fC in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our experiments revealed that in certain genomic locations 5fC is present at comparable levels to 5hmC and 5mC. The combination of these chemical methods can quantify and precisely map these three cytosine derivatives in the genome and will help provide insights into their function. Cytosine base modifications 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-formylcytosine (5fC) are present in mammalian DNA. Reduced bisulfite sequencing is now developed for quantitatively sequencing 5fC at single-base resolution. This method is then applied with oxidative bisulfite sequencing to gain a map of 5mC, 5hmC and 5fC in mouse embryonic stem cells.

Title: 
Sustained gastrointestinal activity of dendronized polymer–enzyme conjugates

Methods to stabilize and retain enzyme activity in the gastrointestinal tract are investigated rarely because of the difficulty of protecting proteins from an environment that has evolved to promote their digestion. Preventing the degradation of enzymes under these conditions, however, is critical for the development of new protein-based oral therapies. Here we show that covalent conjugation to polymers can stabilize orally administered therapeutic enzymes at different locations in the gastrointestinal tract. Architecturally and functionally diverse polymers are used to protect enzymes sterically from inactivation and to promote interactions with mucin on the stomach wall. Using this approach the in vivo activity of enzymes can be sustained for several hours in the stomach and/or in the small intestine. These findings provide new insight and a firm basis for the development of new therapeutic and imaging strategies based on orally administered proteins using a simple and accessible technology. Methods for stabilizing enzymatic activity in the gastrointestinal tract are rarely investigated because of the difficulty in protecting proteins from an environment that promotes their digestion. Now, functionally diverse polymers have been conjugated to therapeutic enzymes, which lead to a substantial enhancement of their in vivo activity in the gastrointestinal tract.

Title: 
Non-Markovian polymer reaction kinetics

Describing the kinetics of polymer reactions, such as the formation of loops and hairpins in nucleic acids or polypeptides, is complicated by the structural dynamics of their chains. Although both intramolecular reactions, such as cyclization, and intermolecular reactions have been studied extensively, both experimentally and theoretically, there is to date no exact explicit analytical treatment of transport-limited polymer reaction kinetics, even in the case of the simplest (Rouse) model of monomers connected by linear springs. We introduce a new analytical approach to calculate the mean reaction time of polymer reactions that encompasses the non-Markovian dynamics of monomer motion. This requires that the conformational statistics of the polymer at the very instant of reaction be determined, which provides, as a by-product, new information on the reaction path. We show that the typical reactive conformation of the polymer is more extended than the equilibrium conformation, which leads to reaction times significantly shorter than predicted by the existing classical Markovian theory. Quantifying polymer reaction kinetics requires the non-Markovian dynamics of monomer motion to be taken into account. This difficulty is overcome by explicitly determining the typical reactive conformations of the polymer, which are found to be more extended than equilibrium conformations, leading to reaction times significantly shorter than predicted by existing Markovian theories.

Catalytic dehydroaromatization of n-alkanes by pincer-ligated iridium complexes

Aromatic hydrocarbons are among the most important building blocks in the chemical industry. Benzene, toluene and xylenes are obtained from the high temperature thermolysis of alkanes. Higher alkylaromatics are generally derived from arene–olefin coupling, which gives branched products—that is, secondary alkyl arenes—with olefins higher than ethylene. The dehydrogenation of acyclic alkanes to give alkylaromatics can be achieved using heterogeneous catalysts at high temperatures, but with low yields and low selectivity. We present here the first catalytic conversion of n-alkanes to alkylaromatics using homogeneous or molecular catalysts—specifically ‘pincer’-ligated iridium complexes—and olefinic hydrogen acceptors. For example, the reaction of n-octane affords up to 86% yield of aromatic product, primarily o-xylene and secondarily ethylbenzene. In the case of n-decane and n-dodecane, the resulting alkylarenes are exclusively unbranched (that is, n-alkyl-substituted), with selectivity for the corresponding o-(n-alkyl)toluene. Aromatic hydrocarbons are among the most important building blocks in the chemical industry. Here, n-alkanes are catalytically converted to alkylaromatics, in yields up to 86%, using ‘pincer’-ligated iridium complexes and olefinic hydrogen acceptors. The carbon number of the n-alkanes is retained in the products, which are exclusively unbranched (n-alkyl-substituted).

Selection of supramolecular chirality by application of rotational and magnetic forces

Many essential biological molecules exist only in one of two possible mirror-image structures, either because they possess a chiral unit or through their structure (helices, for example, are intrinsically chiral), but so far the origin of this homochirality has not been unraveled. Here we demonstrate that the handedness of helical supramolecular aggregates formed by achiral molecules can be directed by applying rotational, gravitational and orienting forces during the self-assembly process. In this system, supramolecular chirality is determined by the relative directions of rotation and magnetically tuned effective gravity, but the magnetic orientation of the aggregates is also essential. Applying these external forces only during the nucleation step of the aggregation is sufficient to achieve chiral selection. This result shows that an almost instantaneous chiral perturbation can be transferred and amplified in growing supramolecular self-assemblies, and provides evidence that a falsely chiral influence is able to induce absolute enantioselection. It is shown here that the proper combination of physical forces can induce chirality during the self-assembly of achiral molecules. Rotation and effective gravity created by high magnetic fields during the nucleation phase, together with the magnetic alignment of the nanoaggregates initially formed, control the enantioselectivity of porphyrin assemblies.

The Jekyll-and-Hyde chemistry of Phaeobacter gallaeciensis

Emiliania huxleyi, an environmentally important marine microalga, has a bloom-and-bust lifestyle in which massive algal blooms appear and fade. Phaeobacter gallaeciensis belongs to the roseobacter clade of α-Proteobacteria, the populations of which wax and wane with that of E. huxleyi. Roseobacter are thought to promote algal growth by biosynthesizing and secreting antibiotics and growth stimulants (auxins). Here we show that P. gallaeciensis switches its secreted small molecule metabolism to the production of potent and selective algaecides, the roseobacticides, in response to p-coumaric acid, an algal lignin breakdown product that is symptomatic of aging algae. This switch converts P. gallaeciensis into an opportunistic pathogen of its algal host. Marine bacteria and algae engage in intermittent symbioses mediated by unknown molecular signals. Here, it is shown that a chemical signal, p-coumaric acid, produced by the breakdown of algal lignin, causes the usually symbiotic bacterium Phaeobacter gallaeciensis to produce new metabolites (the roseobacticides) with potent but selective algaecidal activity.

Title: 
A protonation-coupled feedback mechanism controls the signalling process in bathy phytochromes

Phytochromes are bimodal photoswitches composed of a photosensor and an output module. Photoactivation of the sensor is initiated by a double bond isomerization of the tetrapyrrole chromophore and eventually leads to protein conformational changes. Recently determined structural models of phytochromes identify differences between the inactive and the signalling state but do not reveal the mechanism of photosensor activation or deactivation. Here, we report a vibrational spectroscopic study on bathy phytochromes that demonstrates that the formation of the photoactivated state and thus (de)activation of the output module is based on proton translocations in the chromophore pocket coupling chromophore and protein structural changes. These proton transfer steps, involving the tetrapyrrole and a nearby histidine, also enable thermal back-isomerization of the chromophore via keto–enol tautomerization to afford the initial dark state. Thus, the same proton re-arrangements inducing the (de)activation of the output module simultaneously initiate the reversal of this process, corresponding to a negative feedback mechanism. Photoswitching of phytochromes is based on the isomerization of the tetrapyrrole chromophore, and eventually leads to the (de)activation of an enzymatic output module. Now it has been shown that both the structural changes associated with photoswitching and the thermal decay of the light-activated state are coupled to proton translocations in the chromophore pocket.

Reticular synthesis of porous molecular 1D nanotubes and 3D networks

Synthetic control over pore size and pore connectivity is the crowning achievement for porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). The same level of control has not been achieved for molecular crystals, which are not defined by strong, directional intermolecular coordination bonds. Hence, molecular crystallization is inherently less controllable than framework crystallization, and there are fewer examples of ‘reticular synthesis’, in which multiple building blocks can be assembled according to a common assembly motif. Here we apply a chiral recognition strategy to a new family of tubular covalent cages to create both 1D porous nanotubes and 3D diamondoid pillared porous networks. The diamondoid networks are analogous to MOFs prepared from tetrahedral metal nodes and linear ditopic organic linkers. The crystal structures can be rationalized by computational lattice-energy searches, which provide an in silico screening method to evaluate candidate molecular building blocks. These results are a blueprint for applying the ‘node and strut’ principles of reticular synthesis to molecular crystals. Porous molecular crystals have desirable properties, but are hard to form with the level of structural control seen for extended framework materials. Now, a ‘mix-and-match’ chiral recognition strategy has been used to form reticular porous supramolecular nanotubes and 3D networks, providing a blueprint for pore design in molecular crystals.

O-GlcNAc modification blocks the aggregation and toxicity of the protein α-synuclein associated with Parkinson's disease

Several aggregation-prone proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases can be modified by O-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in vivo. One of these proteins, α-synuclein, is a toxic aggregating protein associated with synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease. However, the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on α-synuclein is not clear. Here, we use synthetic protein chemistry to generate both unmodified α-synuclein and α-synuclein bearing a site-specific O-GlcNAc modification at the physiologically relevant threonine residue 72. We show that this single modification has a notable and substoichiometric inhibitory effect on α-synuclein aggregation, while not affecting the membrane binding or bending properties of α-synuclein. O-GlcNAcylation is also shown to affect the phosphorylation of α-synuclein in vitro and block the toxicity of α-synuclein that was exogenously added to cells in culture. These results suggest that increasing O-GlcNAcylation may slow the progression of synucleinopathies and further support a general function for O-GlcNAc in preventing protein aggregation. O-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) has been identified as an endogenous modification of α-synuclein; however, its effect on the properties of the protein is unclear. Now, recombinant protein and synthetic peptides have been combined to produce both unmodified and site-specifically O-GlcNAc-modified α-synuclein. The O-GlcNAc modification at threonine 72 was shown to inhibit the aggregation and associated toxicity of α-synuclein.

Combinatorial evolution of site- and enantioselective catalysts for polyene epoxidation

Selectivity in the catalytic functionalization of complex molecules is a major challenge in chemical synthesis. The problem is magnified when there are several possible stereochemical outcomes and when similar functional groups occur repeatedly within the same molecule. Selective polyene oxidation provides an archetypical example of this challenge. Historically, enzymatic catalysis has provided the only precedents. Although non-enzymatic catalysts that meet some of these challenges became known, a comprehensive solution has remained elusive. Here, we describe low molecular weight peptide-based catalysts, discovered through a combinatorial synthesis and screening protocol, that exhibit site- and enantioselective oxidation of certain positions of various isoprenols. This diversity-based approach, which exhibits features reminiscent of the directed evolution of enzymes, delivers catalysts that compare favourably to the state-of-the-art for the asymmetric oxidation of these compounds. Moreover, the approach culminated in catalysts that exhibit alternative-site selectivity in comparison to oxidation catalysts previously described. Aspartic acid-based catalysts that are selective for oxidation of either the 2,3 position or the 6,7 position of certain isoprenols have been discovered. The catalysts emerged from a diversity-based approach employing the one-bead-one-compound libraries. The site-selectivity of the catalysis seems to derive from the hydroxyl group in the substrate, although the details of this are not yet known.

Small-molecule-mediated G-quadruplex isolation from human cells

Nucleic acids containing stretches of tandem guanines can fold into four-stranded structures called G-quadruplexes. The existence of such sequences in genomic DNA suggests the occurrence of these motifs in cells, with potential implications in a number of biological processes relevant to cancer. Small molecules have proven to be valuable tools to dissect cell circuitry. Here, we describe a synthetic small molecule derived from an N,N′-bis(2-quinolinyl)pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide, which is designed to mediate the selective isolation of G-quadruplex nucleic acids. The methodology was successfully applied to a range of DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes in vitro. We demonstrate the general applicability of the method by isolating telomeric DNA-containing G-quadruplex motifs from cells. We show that telomeres are targets for the probe, providing further evidence of the formation of G-quadruplexes in human cells. A small-molecule-affinity tag has been designed to mediate the selective isolation of G-quadruplex nucleic acids in a structure-dependant manner. This concept has been applied to the pull-down of G-quadruplex-containing fragments from human cells, and the methodology holds promise for the elucidation of their putative biological functions.

Generation and exploitation of acyclic azomethine imines in chiral Brønsted acid catalysis

Successful implementation of a catalytic asymmetric synthesis strategy to produce enantiomerically enriched compounds requires the adoption of suitable prochiral substrates. The combination of an azomethine imine electrophile with various nucleophiles could give straightforward access to a number of synthetically useful chiral hydrazines, but is used rarely. Here we report the exploitation of acyclic azomethine imines as a new type of prochiral electrophile. They can be generated in situ by the condensation of N′-benzylbenzoylhydrazide with a variety of aldehydes in the presence of a catalytic amount of an axially chiral dicarboxylic acid. By trapping these electrophiles with alkyl diazoacetate or (diazomethyl)phosphonate nucleophiles, we produced a diverse array of chiral α-diazo-β-hydrazino esters and phosphonates with excellent enantioselectivities. Acyclic azomethine imines would be useful prochiral electrophiles in catalytic asymmetric reactions, but their generation often requires harsh conditions. Here, they are generated under mild conditions in the presence of an axially chiral dicarboxylic acid, with the chiral counterion (the conjugate base) then directing an enantioselective reaction with a diazoacetate nucleophile.

Dye-sensitized solar cells with 13% efficiency achieved through the molecular engineering of porphyrin sensitizers

Dye-sensitized solar cells have gained widespread attention in recent years because of their low production costs, ease of fabrication and tunable optical properties, such as colour and transparency. Here, we report a molecularly engineered porphyrin dye, coded SM315, which features the prototypical structure of a donor–π-bridge–acceptor and both maximizes electrolyte compatibility and improves light-harvesting properties. Linear-response, time-dependent density functional theory was used to investigate the perturbations in the electronic structure that lead to improved light harvesting. Using SM315 with the cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle resulted in dye-sensitized solar cells that exhibit a high open-circuit voltage VOC of 0.91&nbsp;V, short-circuit current density JSC of 18.1&nbsp;mA&nbsp;cm–2, fill factor of 0.78 and a power conversion efficiency of 13%. A dye that both maximizes electrolyte compatibility and improves light-harvesting properties has been designed for dye-sensitized solar cells. In cells based on the cobalt(II)/(III) redox mediator, use of the dye resulted in a power-conversion efficiency of 13%, revealing the great potential of porphyrin dyes for future solar cell applications.

Construction of bispirooxindoles containing three quaternary stereocentres in a cascade using a single multifunctional organocatalyst

Single-step constructions of molecules with multiple quaternary carbon stereocentres are rare. The spirooxindole structural motif is common to a range of bioactive compounds; however, asymmetric synthesis of this motif is complicated due to the presence of multiple chiral centres. The development of organocatalytic cascade reactions has proven to be valuable for the construction of several chiral centres in one step. Here, we describe a newly designed organocatalytic asymmetric domino Michael–aldol reaction between 3-substituted oxindoles and methyleneindolinones that affords complex bispirooxindoles. This reaction was catalysed by a novel multifunctional organocatalyst that contains tertiary and primary amines and thiourea moieties to activate substrates simultaneously, providing extraordinary levels of stereocontrol over four stereocentres, three of which are quaternary carbon stereocentres. This new methodology provides facile access to a range of multisubstituted bispirocyclooxindole derivatives, and should be useful in medicinal chemistry and diversity-oriented syntheses of this intriguing class of compounds. Spirooxindoles are important structural motifs found in an array of bioactive compounds. Here a Michael–aldol domino reaction for the construction of bispirooxindoles is presented, creating four stereocentres, including three quaternary carbon centres. Novel multifunctional organocatalysts have been developed for this transformation.

On the mechanism of vibrational control of light-induced charge transfer in donor–bridge–acceptor assemblies

Nuclear–electronic (vibronic) coupling is increasingly recognized as a mechanism of major importance in controlling the light-induced function of molecular systems. It was recently shown that infrared light excitation of intramolecular vibrations can radically change the efficiency of electron transfer, a fundamental chemical process. We now extend and generalize the understanding of this phenomenon by probing and perturbing vibronic coupling in several molecules in solution. In the experiments an ultrafast electronic–vibrational pulse sequence is applied to a range of donor–bridge–acceptor Pt(II) trans-acetylide assemblies, for which infrared excitation of selected bridge vibrations during ultraviolet-initiated charge separation alters the yields of light-induced product states. The experiments, augmented by quantum chemical calculations, reveal a complex combination of vibronic mechanisms responsible for the observed changes in electron transfer rates and pathways. The study raises new fundamental questions about the function of vibrational processes immediately following charge transfer photoexcitation, and highlights the molecular features necessary for external vibronic control of excited-state processes. The ultrafast and mode-specific infrared excitation of several donor–bridge–acceptor (DBA) assemblies in solution has been shown to modulate their light-induced electron transfer properties. New insights are afforded into the role of vibrational processes immediately following light absorption in charge-transfer molecules and a recipe for efficient ‘vibrational control’ of electron transfer is proposed.

Natural-product-derived fragments for fragment-based ligand discovery

Fragment-based ligand and drug discovery predominantly employs sp2-rich compounds covering well-explored regions of chemical space. Despite the ease with which such fragments can be coupled, this focus on flat compounds is widely cited as contributing to the attrition rate of the drug discovery process. In contrast, biologically validated natural products are rich in stereogenic centres and populate areas of chemical space not occupied by average synthetic molecules. Here, we have analysed more than 180,000 natural product structures to arrive at 2,000 clusters of natural-product-derived fragments with high structural diversity, which resemble natural scaffolds and are rich in sp3-configured centres. The structures of the cluster centres differ from previously explored fragment libraries, but for nearly half of the clusters representative members are commercially available. We validate their usefulness for the discovery of novel ligand and inhibitor types by means of protein X-ray crystallography and the identification of novel stabilizers of inactive conformations of p38α MAP kinase and of inhibitors of several phosphatases. Natural products populate areas of chemical space not occupied by average synthetic molecules. Here, an analysis of more than 180,000 natural product structures results in a library of 2,000 natural-product-derived fragments, which resemble the properties of the natural products themselves and give access to novel inhibitor chemotypes.

Roaming-mediated isomerization in the photodissociation of nitrobenzene

Roaming reactions comprise a new class of reaction in which a molecule undergoes frustrated dissociation to radicals, followed by an intramolecular abstraction reaction. Nitro compounds have long been known to dissociate to give NO as a major product. However, rates based upon isomerization via calculated tight transition states are implausibly slow, so the key dissociation pathway for this important class of molecules remains obscure. Here, we present an imaging study of the photodissociation of nitrobenzene with state-specific detection of the resulting NO products. We observe a bimodal translational energy distribution in which the slow products are formed with low NO rotational excitation, and the fast component is associated with high rotational excitation. High-level ab initio calculations identified a ‘roaming-type’ saddle point on the ground state. Branching ratio calculations then show that thermal dissociation of nitrobenzene is dominated by ‘roaming-mediated isomerization’ to phenyl nitrite, which subsequently decomposes to give C6H5O&nbsp;+&nbsp;NO. ‘Roaming’ is a recently discovered reaction dynamics phenomenon in which a molecule undergoes frustrated dissociation to radicals, followed by an intramolecular abstraction reaction. An imaging study, with associated high-level ab initio calculations, has now shown that ‘roaming-mediated isomerization’ plays a key role in the photodissociation of nitrobenzene.

Catalytic activity in individual cracking catalyst particles imaged throughout different life stages by selective staining

Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is the major conversion process used in oil refineries to produce valuable hydrocarbons from crude oil fractions. Because the demand for oil-based products is ever increasing, research has been ongoing to improve the performance of FCC catalyst particles, which are complex mixtures of zeolite and binder materials. Unfortunately, there is limited insight into the distribution and activity of individual zeolitic domains at different life stages. Here we introduce a staining method to visualize the structure of zeolite particulates and other FCC components. Brønsted acidity maps have been constructed at the single particle level from fluorescence microscopy images. By applying a statistical methodology to a series of catalysts deactivated via industrial protocols, a correlation is established between Brønsted acidity and cracking activity. The generally applicable method has clear potential for catalyst diagnostics, as it determines intra- and interparticle Brønsted acidity distributions for industrial FCC materials. Insight into the active zeolitic domains of catalyst particles used in fluid catalytic cracking is limited by the particles' complex nature, but is crucial to improving these billion dollar catalysts. Now, a staining method allows confocal fluorescence microscopy to probe within single catalyst particles, and correlate Brønsted acidity distributions to catalytic activity.

Title: 
Synthesis of a metal oxide with a room-temperature photoreversible phase transition

Photoinduced phase-transition materials, such as chalcogenides, spin-crossover complexes, photochromic organic compounds and charge-transfer materials, are of interest because of their application to optical data storage. Here we report a photoreversible metal–semiconductor phase transition at room temperature with a unique phase of Ti3O5, λ-Ti3O5. λ-Ti3O5 nanocrystals are made by the combination of reverse-micelle and sol–gel techniques. Thermodynamic analysis suggests that the photoinduced phase transition originates from a particular state of λ-Ti3O5 trapped at a thermodynamic local energy minimum. Light irradiation causes reversible switching between this trapped state (λ-Ti3O5) and the other energy-minimum state (β-Ti3O5), both of which are persistent phases. This is the first demonstration of a photorewritable phenomenon at room temperature in a metal oxide. λ-Ti3O5 satisfies the operation conditions required for a practical optical storage system (operational temperature, writing data by short wavelength light and the appropriate threshold laser power). Optically driven phase transitions are widely used in optical memory devices, and the materials showing this effect are normally chalcogenides or organic compounds. Now a room-temperature light-induced phase transition between metal and semiconducting phases has been observed in a titanium oxide material.

Title: 
Catalyst selection based on intermediate stability measured by mass spectrometry

The power of natural selection through survival of the fittest is nature's ultimate tool for the improvement and advancement of species. To apply this concept in catalyst development is attractive and may lead to more rapid discoveries of new catalysts for the synthesis of relevant targets, such as pharmaceuticals. Recent advances in ligand synthesis using combinatorial methods have allowed the generation of a great diversity of catalysts. However, selection methods are few in number. We introduce a new selection method that focuses on the stability of catalytic intermediates measured by mass spectrometry. The stability of the intermediate relates inversely to the reactivity of the catalyst, which forms the basis of a catalyst-screening protocol in which less-abundant species represent the most-active catalysts, ‘the survival of the weakest’. We demonstrate this concept in the palladium-catalysed allylic alkylation reaction using diphosphine and IndolPhos ligands and support our results with high-level density functional theory calculations. Identifying the best catalyst for a particular reaction traditionally involves testing a wide variety of metal and ligand combinations in standard reactions. Here, the best catalyst is found by using mass spectrometry to identify the least stable — and thus most reactive — intermediate in a dynamic mixture of complexes.

Geometric and electronic structure and reactivity of a mononuclear ‘side-on’ nickel(iii)–peroxo complex

Metal-dioxygen adducts, such as metal-superoxo and -peroxo species, are key intermediates often detected in the catalytic cycles of dioxygen activation by metalloenzymes and biomimetic compounds. The synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of an end-on nickel(II)-superoxo complex with a 14-membered macrocyclic ligand was reported previously. Here we report the isolation, spectroscopic characterization, and high-resolution crystal structure of a mononuclear side-on nickel(III)-peroxo complex with a 12-membered macrocyclic ligand, [Ni(12-TMC)(O2)]+ (1) (12-TMC&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,4,7,10-tetramethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane). In contrast to the end-on nickel(II)-superoxo complex, the nickel(III)-peroxo complex is not reactive in electrophilic reactions, but is capable of conducting nucleophilic reactions. The nickel(III)-peroxo complex transfers the bound dioxygen to manganese(II) complexes, thus affording the corresponding nickel(II) and manganese(III)-peroxo complexes. Our results demonstrate the significance of supporting ligands in tuning the geometric and electronic structures and reactivities of metal–O2 intermediates that have been shown to have biological as well as synthetic usefulness in biomimetic reactions. Compounds containing dioxygen bonded to metal atoms – such as metal-peroxo or -superoxo species – are models of enzymes that can activate oxygen. Now a mononuclear side-on nickel(III)-peroxo complex has been made, which is stabilized by a macrocyclic ligand. The complex can transfer the bound dioxygen to another metal, and conduct nucleophilic reactions.

Pattern transformation with DNA circuits

Readily programmable chemical networks are important tools as the scope of chemistry expands from individual molecules to larger molecular systems. Although many complex systems are constructed using conventional organic and inorganic chemistry, the programmability of biological molecules such as nucleic acids allows for precise, high-throughput and automated design, as well as simple, rapid and robust implementation. Here we show that systematic and quantitative control over the diffusivity and reactivity of DNA molecules yields highly programmable chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that execute at the macroscale. In particular, we designed and implemented non-enzymatic DNA circuits capable of performing pattern-transformation algorithms such as edge detection. We also showed that it is possible to fine-tune and multiplex such circuits. We believe these strategies will provide programmable platforms on which to prototype CRNs, discover bottom-up construction principles and generate patterns in materials. The programmable nature of chemical reactions enables the creation of complex networks; however, it can be difficult to redesign the underlying reactions. Here, systematic and quantitative control over the diffusivity and reactivity of DNA molecules yields highly programmable chemical reaction networks that execute macroscale pattern transformation algorithms, such as edge detection.

Electrically induced bonding of DNA to gold

The development of single-molecule techniques has afforded many new methods for the observation and assembly of supramolecular structures and biomolecular networks. We previously reported a method, known as the single-molecule cut-and-paste approach, to pick up and deposit individual DNA strands on a surface. This, however, required pre-functionalization of the surface with DNA strands complementary to those that were to be picked up and then deposited. Here we show that single molecules of double-stranded DNA, bound to the tip of an atomic force microscope, can be deposited on a bare gold electrode using an electrical trigger (surface potential cycling). The interactions between the DNA and the electrode were investigated and we found that double-stranded DNA chemisorbs to the gold electrode exclusively at its end through primary amine groups. We corroborated this finding in experiments in which only a single adenosine nucleotide on a polyethylene glycol spacer was ‘electrosorbed’ to the gold electrode. The assembly and evaluation of molecular structures on surfaces has been boosted by advances in single-molecule techniques. The development of such methods are continued here, showing that double-stranded DNA, bound to the tip of an atomic force microscope, can be deposited on the surface of a gold electrode using an electrical trigger.

Title: 
An iron complex with pendent amines as a molecular electrocatalyst for oxidation of hydrogen

The increasing energy needs of society have led to a search for technologies that can tap carbon-neutral and sustainable energy sources, such as solar and wind. Using properly designed catalysts, such sources can also be used to create fuels such as hydrogen; however, a significant barrier to the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier is the need for an inexpensive and efficient catalyst for its oxidation. The oxidation of hydrogen is the process by which electricity is produced in low-temperature fuel cells, and the best catalyst for this is platinum—a precious metal of low abundance. Here we report a molecular complex of iron (an abundant and inexpensive metal) as a rationally designed electrocatalyst for the oxidation of H2 at room temperature, with turnover frequencies of 0.66–2.0&nbsp;s−1 and low overpotentials of 160–220&nbsp;mV. This iron complex, , has pendent amines in the diphosphine ligand that function as proton relays. Electricity can be produced by the oxidation of hydrogen in fuel cells, but the best catalyst for this is platinum, a precious metal of low abundance. Now a molecular complex of iron, a very abundant, inexpensive metal, has been rationally designed for the oxidation of H2 at room temperature.

Title: 
Dinitrogen cleavage and functionalization by carbon monoxide promoted by a hafnium complex

Molecular nitrogen (N2) and carbon monoxide (CO) have the two strongest bonds in chemistry and present significant challenges in developing new transformations that exploit these two abundant feedstocks. At the core of this objective is the discovery of transition-metal compounds that promote the six-electron reductive cleavage of N2 at ambient temperature and pressure and also promote new nitrogen–element bond formation. Here we show that an organometallic hafnium compound induces N2 cleavage on the addition of CO, with a simultaneous assembly of new nitrogen–carbon and carbon–carbon bonds. Subsequent addition of a weak acid liberates oxamide, which demonstrates that an important agrochemical can be synthesized directly from N2 and CO. These studies introduce an alternative paradigm for N2 cleavage and functionalization in which the six-electron reductive cleavage is promoted by both the transition metal and the incoming ligand, CO, used for the new bond formations. Two abundant feedstocks, dinitrogen and carbon monoxide, have the strongest bonds in chemistry, so breaking them is a significant challenge. An organometallic hafnium compound has now been shown to induce nitrogen cleavage on addition of carbon monoxide, with simultaneous assembly of new nitrogen–carbon and carbon–carbon bonds.

Entangled quantum electronic wavefunctions of the Mn4CaO5 cluster in photosystem II

It is a long-standing goal to understand the reaction mechanisms of catalytic metalloenzymes at an entangled many-electron level, but this is hampered by the exponential complexity of quantum mechanics. Here, by exploiting the special structure of physical quantum states and using the density matrix renormalization group, we compute near-exact many-electron wavefunctions of the Mn4CaO5 cluster of photosystem II, with more than 1&nbsp;×&nbsp;1018 quantum degrees of freedom. This is the first treatment of photosystem II beyond the single-electron picture of density functional theory. Our calculations support recent modifications to the structure determined by X-ray crystallography. We further identify multiple low-lying energy surfaces associated with the structural distortion seen using X-ray crystallography, highlighting multistate reactivity in the chemistry of the cluster. Direct determination of Mn spin-projections from our wavefunctions suggests that current candidates that have been recently distinguished using parameterized spin models should be reassessed. Through entanglement maps, we reveal rich information contained in the wavefunctions on bonding changes in the cycle. Many-electron quantum modelling of the metal clusters in metalloenzymes is a long-standing ambition for theoreticians. Here, using the density matrix renormalization group, the many-electron wavefunctions of the Mn4CaO5 cluster of photosystem II are computed, providing new insights into the electronic structure and reactivity at the level of many-particle quantum mechanics and entanglement.

Interrogating viral capsid assembly with ion mobility–mass spectrometry

Most proteins fulfil their function as part of large protein complexes. Surprisingly, little is known about the pathways and regulation of protein assembly. Several viral coat proteins can spontaneously assemble into capsids in vitro with morphologies identical to the native virion and thus resemble ideal model systems for studying protein complex formation. Even for these systems, the mechanism for self-assembly is still poorly understood, although it is generally thought that smaller oligomeric structures form key intermediates. This assembly nucleus and larger viral assembly intermediates are typically low abundant and difficult to monitor. Here, we characterised small oligomers of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and norovirus under equilibrium conditions using native ion mobility mass spectrometry. This data in conjunction with computational modelling enabled us to elucidate structural features of these oligomers. Instead of more globular shapes, the intermediates exhibit sheet-like structures suggesting that they are assembly competent. We propose pathways for the formation of both capsids. Although most proteins fulfil their role as part of large protein complexes, little is known about the pathways of complex assembly. Here, ion mobility–mass spectrometry is used to monitor and structurally characterize the assembly intermediates of viral protein shells, called capsids, of two major human pathogens, norovirus and hepatitis B virus.

Title: 
Crystal structure of Δ-[Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ bound to mismatched DNA reveals side-by-side metalloinsertion and intercalation

DNA mismatches represent a novel target in the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for cancer, because deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair are implicated in cancers, and cells that are repair-deficient show a high frequency of mismatches. Metal complexes with bulky intercalating ligands serve as probes for DNA mismatches. Here, we report the high-resolution (0.92&nbsp;Å) crystal structure of the ruthenium ‘light switch’ complex Δ-[Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (bpy&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,2′-bipyridine and dppz&nbsp;=&nbsp;dipyridophenazine), which is known to show luminescence on binding to duplex DNA, bound to both mismatched and well-matched sites in the oligonucleotide 5′-(dCGGAAATTACCG)2-3′ (underline denotes AA mismatches). Two crystallographically independent views reveal that the complex binds mismatches through metalloinsertion, ejecting both mispaired adenosines. Additional ruthenium complexes are intercalated at well-matched sites, creating an array of complexes in the minor groove stabilized by stacking interactions between bpy ligands and extruded adenosines. This structure attests to the generality of metalloinsertion and metallointercalation as DNA binding modes. A ‘light switch’ ruthenium complex is known to show enhanced luminescence in the presence of DNA mismatches — emerging targets for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics — but the way it interacts with DNA has remained unclear. Now, metalloinsertion into and metallointercalation at the minor groove of the double helix have been unambiguously observed in a high-resolution crystal structure.

Title: 
A diiron(iv) complex that cleaves strong C–H and O–H bonds

The controlled cleavage of strong C–H bonds such as those of methane poses a significant and industrially important challenge for chemists. In nature, methane is oxidized to methanol by soluble methane monooxygenase via a diiron(iv) intermediate called Q. However, the only two reported diiron(iv) complexes have activities towards C–H bonds that fall far short of the activity of this biological catalyst. In this paper, we model the chemistry of MMO-Q by generating an oxo-bridged diiron(iv) complex by electrochemical oxidation. This species is a more effective oxidant. It can attack C–H bonds as strong as 100&nbsp;kcal&nbsp;mol−1 and reacts with cyclohexane 100- to 1,000-fold faster than mononuclear FeIV=O complexes of closely related ligands. Strikingly, this species can also cleave the strong O–H bonds of methanol and t-butanol instead of their weaker C–H bonds, representing the first example of O–H bond activation for iron complexes. Carbon–hydrogen bonds are strong and stable, rarely succumbing to the activation attempts of chemists. Certain bacteria are able to metabolize methane using a diiron-centred enzyme, but synthetic analogues have had much less reactivity. Now, an oxo-bridged diiron complex has been shown to have extremely high activity towards C–H bonds.

Title: 
Carboalumination of a chromium–chromium quintuple bond

Bonds are at the very heart of chemistry. Although the order of carbon–carbon bonds only extends to triple bonds, metal–metal bond orders of up to five are known for stable compounds, particularly between chromium atoms. Carbometallation and especially carboalumination reactions of carbon–carbon double and triple bonds are a well established synthetic protocol in organometallic chemistry and organic synthesis. We now extend these reactions to compounds containing chromium–chromium quintuple bonds. Analogous reactivity patterns indicate that such quintuple bonds are not as exotic as previously assumed. Yet the particularities of these reactions reflect the specific nature of the high metal–metal bond orders. Extremely short quintuple bonds between chromium atoms have recently been discovered. Carboalumination reactions have now been performed to further investigate the properties of these unusual bonds, and show that they have interesting analogies to lower-order bonds, as well as revealing more about the nature of quintuple bonds.

Molecular heterometallic hydride clusters composed of rare-earth and d-transition metals

Heteromultimetallic hydride clusters containing both rare-earth and d-transition metals are of interest in terms of both their structure and reactivity. However, such heterometallic complexes have not yet been investigated to a great extent because of difficulties in their synthesis and structural characterization. Here, we report the synthesis, X-ray and neutron diffraction studies, and hydrogen addition and release properties of a family of rare-earth/d-transition-metal heteromultimetallic polyhydride complexes of the core structure type ‘Ln4MHn’ (Ln&nbsp;=&nbsp;Y, Dy, Ho; M&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mo, W; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;9, 11, 13). Monitoring of hydrogen addition to a hydride cluster such as [{(C5Me4SiMe3)Y}4(μ-H)9Mo(C5Me5)] in a single-crystal to single-crystal process by X-ray diffraction has been achieved for the first time. Density functional theory studies reveal that the hydrogen addition process is cooperatively assisted by the Y/Mo heteromultimetallic sites, thus offering unprecedented insight into the hydrogen addition and release process of a metal hydride cluster. Well-defined molecular polyhydrides composed of two substantially different types of metals — such as rare-earth and d transition metals — are interesting both in terms of structure and potential properties, but have been largely unexplored so far. Now, a series of such hydride clusters are reported and are found to exhibit unprecedented structural features as well as unique hydrogen addition and release properties.

Title: 
An AAAA–DDDD quadruple hydrogen-bond array

Secondary electrostatic interactions between adjacent hydrogen bonds can have a significant effect on the stability of a supramolecular complex. In theory, the binding strength should be maximized if all the hydrogen-bond donors (D) are on one component and all the hydrogen-bond acceptors (A) are on the other. Here, we describe a readily accessible AAAA–DDDD quadruple hydrogen-bonding array that exhibits exceptionally strong binding for a small-molecule hydrogen-bonded complex in a range of different solvents (Ka&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;3&nbsp;×&nbsp;1012&nbsp;M–1 in CH2Cl2, 1.5&nbsp;×&nbsp;106&nbsp;M–1 in CH3CN and 3.4&nbsp;×&nbsp;105&nbsp;M–1 in 10% v/v DMSO/CHCl3). The association constant in CH2Cl2 corresponds to a binding free energy (ΔG) in excess of –71&nbsp;kJ&nbsp;mol–1 (more than 20% of the thermodynamic stability of a carbon–carbon covalent bond), which is remarkable for a supramolecular complex held together by just four intercomponent hydrogen bonds. The stability of multiply hydrogen-bonded complexes can be influenced significantly by secondary electrostatic interactions between the pairs of atoms in adjacent hydrogen bonds. Now, a quadruple hydrogen-bonding array in which all of the donors are located in one component and all of the acceptors in the other has been shown to form complexes that are exceptionally stable.

Title: 
Hidden complexity in the isomerization dynamics of Holliday junctions

A plausible consequence of the rugged folding energy landscapes inherent to biomolecules is that there may be more than one functionally competent folded state. Indeed, molecule-to-molecule variations in the folding dynamics of enzymes and ribozymes have recently been identified in single-molecule experiments, but without systematic quantification or an understanding of their structural origin. Here, using concepts from glass physics and complementary clustering analysis, we provide a quantitative method to analyse single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) data, thereby probing the isomerization dynamics of Holliday junctions, which display such heterogeneous dynamics over a long observation time (Tobs&nbsp;≈&nbsp;40&nbsp;s). We show that the ergodicity of Holliday junction dynamics is effectively broken and that their conformational space is partitioned into a folding network of kinetically disconnected clusters. Theory suggests that the persistent heterogeneity of Holliday junction dynamics is a consequence of internal multiloops with varying sizes and flexibilities frozen by Mg2+ ions. An annealing experiment using Mg2+ pulses lends support to this idea by explicitly showing that interconversions between trajectories with different patterns can be induced. Single-molecule experiments reveal substantial molecule-to-molecule variation in the Mg2+-induced isomerization dynamics of Holliday junctions (HJs). Effective ergodicity breaking of time trajectories results in the partitioning of HJ dynamics into multiple clusters. The observed dynamical heterogeneity is a consequence of various internal multiloop conformations that are frozen by Mg2+ ions.

Title: 
Unusual structure, bonding and properties in a californium borate

The participation of the valence orbitals of actinides in bonding has been debated for decades. Recent experimental and computational investigations demonstrated the involvement of 6p, 6d and/or 5f orbitals in bonding. However, structural and spectroscopic data, as well as theory, indicate a decrease in covalency across the actinide series, and the evidence points to highly ionic, lanthanide-like bonding for late actinides. Here we show that chemical differentiation between californium and lanthanides can be achieved by using ligands that are both highly polarizable and substantially rearrange on complexation. A ligand that suits both of these desired properties is polyborate. We demonstrate that the 5f, 6d and 7p orbitals are all involved in bonding in a Cf(III) borate, and that large crystal-field effects are present. Synthetic, structural and spectroscopic data are complemented by quantum mechanical calculations to support these observations. Actinides generally form ionic compounds, however, when electron-rich ligands with large hyperpolarizabilities are used, partially covalent bonds can also form. Now a rare californium borate is shown to exhibit significant differences from other f-elements in its structure and bonding. Quantum mechanical calculations support Cf and ligand orbital interactions, also indicating partial covalent bonding.

Oxidation of ethane to ethanol by N2O in a metal–organic framework with coordinatively unsaturated iron(II) sites

Enzymatic haem and non-haem high-valent iron–oxo species are known to activate strong C–H bonds, yet duplicating this reactivity in a synthetic system remains a formidable challenge. Although instability of the terminal iron–oxo moiety is perhaps the foremost obstacle, steric and electronic factors also limit the activity of previously reported mononuclear iron(IV)–oxo compounds. In particular, although nature's non-haem iron(IV)–oxo compounds possess high-spin S&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 ground states, this electronic configuration has proved difficult to achieve in a molecular species. These challenges may be mitigated within metal–organic frameworks that feature site-isolated iron centres in a constrained, weak-field ligand environment. Here, we show that the metal–organic framework Fe2(dobdc) (dobdc4−&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and its magnesium-diluted analogue, Fe0.1Mg1.9(dobdc), are able to activate the C–H bonds of ethane and convert it into ethanol and acetaldehyde using nitrous oxide as the terminal oxidant. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the active oxidant is likely to be a high-spin S&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 iron(IV)–oxo species. Selective functionalization of light hydrocarbons is a challenging but desirable transformation. Now a family of Fe(II)-based metal–organic frameworks has been shown to convert ethane into ethanol and acetaldehyde using N2O. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the active Fe oxidant in the MOF is a high-spin S&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 iron(II)–oxo species.

The colibactin warhead crosslinks DNA

Members of the human microbiota are increasingly being correlated to human health and disease states, but the majority of the underlying microbial metabolites that regulate host–microbe interactions remain largely unexplored. Select strains of Escherichia coli present in the human colon have been linked to the initiation of inflammation-induced colorectal cancer through an unknown small-molecule-mediated process. The responsible non-ribosomal peptide–polyketide hybrid pathway encodes ‘colibactin’, which belongs to a largely uncharacterized family of small molecules. Genotoxic small molecules from this pathway that are capable of initiating cancer formation have remained elusive due to their high instability. Guided by metabolomic analyses, here we employ a combination of NMR spectroscopy and bioinformatics-guided isotopic labelling studies to characterize the colibactin warhead, an unprecedented substituted spirobicyclic structure. The warhead crosslinks duplex DNA in vitro, providing direct experimental evidence for colibactin's DNA-damaging activity. The data support unexpected models for both colibactin biosynthesis and its mode of action. Genotoxic small molecules from the bacterial colibactin pathway — a gut-associated non-ribosomal peptide synthetase–polyketide synthase hybrid gene cluster linked to colorectal cancer — have remained elusive due to their instability. Now, one of these, the colibactin warhead, an unprecedented substituted spirobicyclic structure, has been characterized and shown to crosslink duplex DNA in vitro.

Enhanced electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction based on patterning of platinum surfaces with cyanide

The slow rate of the oxygen reduction reaction in the phosphoric acid fuel cell is the main factor limiting its wide application. Here, we present an approach that can be used for the rational design of cathode catalysts with potential use in phosphoric acid fuel cells, or in any environments containing strongly adsorbing tetrahedral anions. This approach is based on molecular patterning of platinum surfaces with cyanide adsorbates that can efficiently block the sites for adsorption of spectator anions while the oxygen reduction reaction proceeds unhindered. We also demonstrate that, depending on the supporting electrolyte anions and cations, on the same CN-covered Pt(111) surface, the oxygen reduction reaction activities can range from a 25-fold increase to a 50-fold decrease. This behaviour is discussed in the light of the role of covalent and non-covalent interactions in controlling the ensemble of platinum active sites required for high turn over rates of the oxygen reduction reaction. The phosphoric acid fuel cell is limited by its slow rate of oxygen reduction at the cathode, but now an approach to the rational design of improved catalysts for this process has been developed. Molecular patterning of platinum surfaces with cyanide adsorbates is used to block the adsorption of spectator anions without hindering oxygen reduction, thus improving catalytic activity.

Synthesis of a molecular trefoil knot by folding and closing on an octahedral coordination template

The advent of template-directed synthesis has provided access to a range of new interlocked molecular architectures. Although many syntheses of molecular catenanes and rotaxanes have been reported, molecular knots are a class of molecules with topologically non-planar graphs that are rather rare. Here we report a synthetic strategy for the preparation of a molecular trefoil knot from a flexible bipyridine oligomer and a zinc(II) octahedral coordination template. The oligomer folds into a stable open-knot conformation in the presence of the template, and trapping of this arrangement through esterification or ring-closing metathesis produces the closed-knot complex. Subsequent removal of the template from the metathesis product results in a molecular trefoil knot. The synthesis of interlocked compounds such as catenanes and rotaxanes has undergone much development in recent years, but molecular knots are still relatively hard to make. It has now been shown that a linear bipyridine oligomer can fold around a single zinc-ion template to form a complex that can be cyclized to give a molecular trefoil knot.

Crystallographic snapshots of the reaction of aromatic C–H with O2 catalysed by a protein-bound iron complex

Chemical reactions inside single crystals are quite rare because crystallinity is difficult to retain owing to atomic rearrangements. Protein crystals in general have a high solvent content. This allows for some molecular flexibility, which makes it possible to trap reaction intermediates of enzymatic reactions without disrupting the crystal lattice. A similar approach has not yet been fully implemented in the field of inorganic chemistry. Here, we have combined model chemistry and protein X-ray crystallography to study the intramolecular aromatic dihydroxylation by an arene-containing protein-bound iron complex. The bound complex was able to activate dioxygen in the presence of a reductant, leading to the formation of catechol as the sole product. The structure determination of four of the catalytic cycle intermediates and the end product showed that the hydroxylation reaction implicates an iron peroxo, generated by reductive O2 activation, an intermediate already observed in iron monooxygenases. This strategy also provided unexpected mechanistic details such as the rearrangement of the iron coordination sphere on metal reduction. Crystallographically studying chemical reactions is difficult because the intermediates are rarely stable enough to be crystallized. Now, protein crystals have been used to trap four reaction intermediates in an aromatic dihydroxylation, showing that an iron peroxo complex is observed.

Tirandamycin biosynthesis is mediated by co-dependent oxidative enzymes

Elucidation of natural product biosynthetic pathways provides important insights into the assembly of potent bioactive molecules, and expands access to unique enzymes able to selectively modify complex substrates. Here, we show full reconstitution, in vitro, of an unusual multi-step oxidative cascade for post-assembly-line tailoring of tirandamycin antibiotics. This pathway involves a remarkably versatile and iterative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (TamI) and a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent oxidase (TamL), which act co-dependently through the repeated exchange of substrates. TamI hydroxylates tirandamycin C (TirC) to generate tirandamycin E (TirE), a previously unidentified tirandamycin intermediate. TirE is subsequently oxidized by TamL, giving rise to the ketone of tirandamycin D (TirD), after which a unique exchange back to TamI enables successive epoxidation and hydroxylation to afford, respectively, the final products tirandamycin A (TirA) and tirandamycin B (TirB). Ligand-free, substrate- and product-bound crystal structures of bicovalently flavinylated TamL oxidase reveal a likely mechanism for the C10 oxidation of TirE. Enzymes are capable of modifying complex organic structures with exquisite selectivity. Understanding these processes could help in the development and production of new bioactive compounds. Here, a complete reconstitution of tailoring steps in tirandamycin biosynthesis shows that two enzymes repeatedly exchange substrates to achieve several different oxidations en route to this family of antibiotic compounds.

Diamidocarbenes as versatile and reversible [2 + 1] cycloaddition reagents

We describe the synthesis of a variety of cyclopropanes and epoxides by combining a readily accessible and isolable N,N′-diamidocarbene with a range of structurally and electronically diverse olefins and aldehydes, including electron-rich derivatives. Surprisingly, the cyclopropanation and epoxidation reactions were discovered to be rapid and thermally reversible at relatively low temperatures, two features often desired for applications that utilize dynamic covalent chemistry. In addition, a diamidocyclopropane derivative prepared via this method was hydrolysed successfully to form the corresponding linear carboxylic acid in a metal- and carbon monoxide-free hydrocarboxylation reaction. As such, diamidocarbenes are expected to find utility in the synthesis of cyclopropanes, epoxides and their derivatives, as well as in dynamic covalent chemistry applications. An isolable diamidocarbene is shown to participate in reversible [2+1] cycloadditions with a variety of both electron-deficient and electron-rich olefins and aldehydes. Subsequent hydrolysis of a N,N′-diamidocyclopropane derived from styrene afforded the corresponding linear carboxylic acid, effectively establishing a metal- and carbon monoxide-free, anti-Markovnikov olefin hydrocarboxylation reaction.

Title: 
A meta-selective C–H borylation directed by a secondary interaction between ligand and substrate

Regioselective C–H bond transformations are potentially the most efficient method for the synthesis of organic molecules. However, the presence of many C–H bonds in organic molecules and the high activation barrier for these reactions make these transformations difficult. Directing groups in the reaction substrate are often used to control regioselectivity, which has been especially successful for the ortho-selective functionalization of aromatic substrates. Here, we describe an iridium-catalysed meta-selective C–H borylation of aromatic compounds using a newly designed catalytic system. The bipyridine-derived ligand that binds iridium contains a pendant urea moiety. A secondary interaction between this urea and a hydrogen-bond acceptor in the substrate places the iridium in close proximity to the meta-C–H bond and thus controls the regioselectivity. 1H NMR studies and control experiments support the participation of hydrogen bonds in inducing regioselectivity. Reversible direction of the catalyst through hydrogen bonds is a versatile concept for regioselective C–H transformations. Directing groups in a substrate are frequently used to direct the regioselectivity of C–H activation reactions. Now it has been shown that regioselectivity can be directed by a ligand, which binds to both the catalysing metal centre and a distal hydrogen-bond acceptor in the substrate. This secondary interaction places the metal in close proximity to the reacting C–H bond.

Visible-light-enhanced catalytic oxidation reactions on plasmonic silver nanostructures

Catalysis plays a critical role in chemical conversion, energy production and pollution mitigation. High activation barriers associated with rate-limiting elementary steps require most commercial heterogeneous catalytic reactions to be run at relatively high temperatures, which compromises energy efficiency and the long-term stability of the catalyst. Here we show that plasmonic nanostructures of silver can concurrently use low-intensity visible light (on the order of solar intensity) and thermal energy to drive catalytic oxidation reactions—such as ethylene epoxidation, CO oxidation, and NH3 oxidation—at lower temperatures than their conventional counterparts that use only thermal stimulus. Based on kinetic isotope experiments and density functional calculations, we postulate that excited plasmons on the silver surface act to populate O2 antibonding orbitals and so form a transient negative-ion state, which thereby facilitates the rate-limiting O2-dissociation reaction. The results could assist the design of catalytic processes that are more energy efficient and robust than current processes. High operating temperatures in heterogeneous catalytic processes compromise energy efficiency, catalyst lifetime and product selectivity. Plasmonic silver nanoparticles are shown to couple thermal energy and a low-intensity photon flux to drive commercially important oxidation reactions at lower temperatures than conventional thermal processes.

Real-time and in situ monitoring of mechanochemical milling reactions

Chemical and structural transformations have long been carried out by milling. Such mechanochemical steps are now ubiquitous in a number of industries (such as the pharmaceutical, chemical and metallurgical industries), and are emerging as excellent environmentally friendly alternatives to solution-based syntheses. However, mechanochemical transformations are typically difficult to monitor in real time, which leaves a large gap in the mechanistic understanding required for their development. We now report the real-time study of mechanochemical transformations in a ball mill by means of in situ diffraction of high-energy synchrotron X-rays. Focusing on the mechanosynthesis of metal–organic frameworks, we have directly monitored reaction profiles, the formation of intermediates, and interconversions of framework topologies. Our results reveal that mechanochemistry is highly dynamic, with reaction rates comparable to or greater than those in solution. The technique also enabled us to probe directly how catalytic additives recently introduced in the mechanosynthesis of metal–organic frameworks, such as organic liquids or ionic species, change the reactivity pathways and kinetics. Milling and grinding, long used to alter the chemical and physical properties of materials, have recently garnered interest as alternatives to traditional solution-based syntheses — but these reactions remain difficult to monitor. High-energy synchrotron X-ray radiation has now enabled the in situ observation, in real time, of solid-state transformations occurring during the mechanochemical syntheses of metal–organic frameworks.

Title: 
The rational design of helium bonds

The chemistry of helium has hitherto been confined to experimental and theoretical analysis of small molecules containing three to five atoms in the gas phase. Here a new suggestion is made for compounds of helium deriving from a recent proposal that five-coordinate carbon might be captured as a frozen SN2 transition state. A series of logical steps, originally discussed as postings and comments to two blogs, led to the outcome described here of a central hypervalent atom bound on one face by a small cyclic carbon ligand, with the other free face having an interaction to a helium atom with the topological properties of a charge-shift rather than a covalent bond. Although high-level theory predicts these helium bonds to be quite short with relatively high stretching frequencies, the kinetic barriers to the loss of helium are predicted to be small, and are not increased by the strategy of having bulky substituents on the ring ligand. Helium is a reluctant participant when it comes to chemical reactions and bonding and it is one of only two stable elements for which there are currently no known crystalline derivatives. Now, based on a computational investigation, compounds containing helium atoms that form charge-shift, rather than covalent bonds have been proposed.

Title: 
Chiral-auxiliary-mediated 1,2-cis-glycosylations for the solid-supported synthesis of a biologically important branched α-glucan

Solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis offers the promise of providing libraries of oligosaccharides for glycomics research. A major stumbling block to solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis has been a lack of general methods for the stereoselective installation of 1,2-cis-glycosides, and intractable mixtures of compounds are obtained if several such glycosides need to be installed. We have prepared on-resin a biologically important glucoside containing multiple 1,2-cis-glycosidic linkages with complete anomeric control by using glycosyl donors having a participating (S)-(phenylthiomethyl)benzyl chiral auxiliary at C2. A branching point could be installed by using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) as a versatile set of orthogonal protecting groups. The synthetic strategy made it possible to achieve partial on-resin deprotection of the completed oligosaccharide, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the synthesis. The combination of classical and auxiliary-mediated neighbouring-group participation for controlling anomeric selectivity is bringing the promise of routine automated solid-supported oligosaccharide synthesis closer. The difficulty in the stereoselective introduction of 1,2-cis-glycosides is a major stumbling block in the solid-supported synthesis of oligosaccharides. Now, this has been achieved for a biologically important glucoside containing multiple 1,2-cis-glycosidic linkages with complete anomeric control by using glycosyl donors having a participating (S)-(phenylthiomethyl)benzyl chiral auxiliary at C-2.

Title: 
A biomimetic polyketide-inspired approach to small-molecule ligand discovery

The discovery of new compounds for the pharmacological manipulation of protein function often embraces the screening of compound collections, and it is widely recognized that natural products offer beneficial characteristics as protein ligands. Much effort has therefore been focused on ‘natural product-like’ libraries, yet the synthesis and screening of such libraries is often limited by one or more of the following: modest library sizes and structural diversity, conformational heterogeneity and the costs associated with the substantial infrastructure of modern high-throughput screening centres. Here, we describe the design and execution of an approach to this broad problem by merging principles associated with biologically inspired oligomerization and the structure of polyketide-derived natural products. A novel class of chiral and conformationally constrained oligomers is described (termed ‘chiral oligomers of pentenoic amides’, COPA), which offers compatibility with split-and-pool methods and can be screened en masse in a batch mode. We demonstrate that a COPA library containing 160,000 compounds is a useful source of novel protein ligands by identifying a non-covalent synthetic ligand to the DNA-binding domain of the p53 transcription factor. The design and synthesis of a family of chiral and conformationally constrained oligomers is described. Asymmetric synthesis of the monomers is presented and the preparation of a 160,000-member library of diverse tetramers via split-and-pool methods is discussed. From this library, a non-covalent ligand to the DNA-binding domain of p53 was discovered.

Title: 
Two- and three-dimensional extended solids and metallization of compressed XeF2

The application of pressure, internal or external, transforms molecular solids into extended solids with more itinerant electrons to soften repulsive interatomic interactions in a tight space. Examples include insulator-to-metal transitions in O2, Xe and I2, as well as molecular-to-non-molecular transitions in CO2 and N2. Here, we present new discoveries of novel two- and three-dimensional extended non-molecular phases of solid XeF2 and their metallization. At ∼50&nbsp;GPa, the transparent linear insulating XeF2 transforms into a reddish two-dimensional graphite-like hexagonal layered structure of semiconducting XeF4. Above 70&nbsp;GPa, it further transforms into a black three-dimensional fluorite-like structure of the first observed metallic XeF8 polyhedron. These simultaneously occurring molecular-to-non-molecular and insulator-to-metal transitions of XeF2 arise from the pressure-induced delocalization of non-bonded lone-pair electrons to sp3d2 hybridization in two-dimensional XeF4 and to p3d5 in three-dimensional XeF8 through the chemical bonding of all eight valence electrons in Xe and, thereby, fulfilling the octet rule at high pressures. Xenon difluoride is one of the most stable noble-gas fluoride compounds with a simple linear molecular structure. It has now been shown to undergo several phase transitions at high pressures to give extended solids and even a metallic phase containing XeF8 polyhedra.

Rapid room-temperature synthesis of nanocrystalline spinels as oxygen reduction and evolution electrocatalysts

Spinels can serve as alternative low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER), which are the key barriers in various electrochemical devices such as metal–air batteries, fuel cells and electrolysers. However, conventional ceramic synthesis of crystalline spinels requires an elevated temperature, complicated procedures and prolonged heating time, and the resulting product exhibits limited electrocatalytic performance. It has been challenging to develop energy-saving, facile and rapid synthetic methodologies for highly active spinels. In this Article, we report the synthesis of nanocrystalline MxMn3–xO4 (M&nbsp;=&nbsp;divalent metals) spinels under ambient conditions and their electrocatalytic application. We show rapid and selective formation of tetragonal or cubic MxMn3–xO4 from the reduction of amorphous MnO2 in aqueous M2+ solution. The prepared CoxMn3–xO4 nanoparticles manifest considerable catalytic activity towards the ORR/OER as a result of their high surface areas and abundant defects. The newly discovered phase-dependent electrocatalytic ORR/OER characteristics of Co–Mn–O spinels are also interpreted by experiment and first-principle theoretical studies. Ceramic preparation of spinels — materials useful for a wide range of applications — requires complicated procedures and heat treatment over long periods. Now, it is shown that rapid synthesis of nanocrystalline Co–Mn–O spinels can be achieved under ambient conditions, and the resulting nanoparticles exhibit considerable catalytic activity towards the electrochemical oxygen reduction/evolution reactions.

Title: 
An efficient approach to chiral fullerene derivatives by catalytic enantioselective 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions

Fullerene chirality is an important but undeveloped issue of paramount interest in fields such as materials science and medicinal chemistry. So far, enantiopure fullerene derivatives have been made from chiral starting materials or obtained by separating racemic mixtures. Here, we report the enantioselective catalytic synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinofullerenes (the most widely studied fullerene derivatives), which proceeds in high yields under very mild conditions at low temperatures. The combination of a particular metal catalyst—Ag(I) or Cu(II)—and a chiral ligand is able to direct the cycloaddition of buckminsterfullerene&nbsp;C60, the first non-coordinating dipolarophile used in such reactions, to opposite enantiofaces of N-metallated azomethine ylides. This methodology has proven to be quite general, affording enantiomeric excesses of greater than 90%. Furthermore, well-defined chiral carbon atoms linked to the fullerene sphere are able to perturb the inherent symmetry of the fullerene π-system as revealed by circular dichroism measurements. The cycloaddition of N-metalated azomethine ylides to C60 can result in the formation of a number of different stereoisomeric products. Now, it has been shown that the stereochemical outcome of this reaction can be controlled by carefully choosing the the correct combination of metal and ligand to form the complex that catalyses this process.

Title: 
A unique approach to aldol products for the creation of all-carbon quaternary stereocentres

Among the challenges facing asymmetric synthesis the selective construction of quaternary stereogenic centres, particularly those bearing all-carbon substituents, stands out. The aldol reaction has the potential to create such stereocentres, but, despite the many advances in this field, a highly selective and efficient procedure has remained elusive. Here we show that, by choosing an alternative retrosynthetic approach, such products can be prepared in a highly selective fashion. Through the consecutive addition of several organometallic derivatives, an allylzinc reagent is prepared and, on addition to an aldehyde, an aldol-type product is created. The one-pot operation involves the construction of three new carbon–carbon bonds and the formation of an all-carbon quaternary stereocentre. The products of the reaction are amenable to downstream modification, and the procedure should find applications in the fields of natural product synthesis and drug discovery. The enantioselective construction of quaternary stereocentres, particularly those with all-carbon substituents, is a challenging problem in asymmetric synthesis. It has now been shown that an alternative retrosynthesis of aldol products provides an opportunity to form such stereocentres with a reaction that creates three new carbon–carbon bonds in a single step.

Title: 
Self-reproduction of supramolecular giant vesicles combined with the amplification of encapsulated DNA

The construction of a protocell from a materials point of view is important in understanding the origin of life. Both self-reproduction of a compartment and self-replication of an informational substance have been studied extensively, but these processes have typically been carried out independently, rather than linked to one another. Here, we demonstrate the amplification of DNA (encapsulated guest) within a self-reproducible cationic giant vesicle (host). With the addition of a vesicular membrane precursor, we observe the growth and spontaneous division of the giant vesicles, accompanied by distribution of the DNA to the daughter giant vesicles. In particular, amplification of the DNA accelerated the division of the giant vesicles. This means that self-replication of an informational substance has been linked to self-reproduction of a compartment through the interplay between polyanionic DNA and the cationic vesicular membrane. Our self-reproducing giant vesicle system therefore represents a step forward in the construction of an advanced model protocell. The self-replication process of a giant vesicle encapsulating double-stranded DNA has been observed, which represents a supramolecular approach to the construction of a protocell. Growth and division of the vesicle occurred rapidly on addition of a membrane precursor, and amplified DNA was distributed amongst the resulting daughter giant vesicles.

Title: 
Vapour-phase gold-surface-mediated coupling of aldehydes with methanol

Selective coupling of oxygenates is critical to many synthetic processes, including those necessary for the development of alternative fuels. We report a general process for selective coupling of aldehydes and methanol as a route to ester synthesis. All steps are mediated by oxygen-covered metallic gold nanoparticles on Au(111). Remarkably, cross-coupling of methanol with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde and benzeneacetaldehyde to methyl esters is promoted by oxygen-covered Au(111) below room temperature with high selectivity. The high selectivity is attributed to the ease of nucleophilic attack of the aldehydes by the methoxy intermediate—formed from methanol on the surface—which yields the methyl esters. The competing combustion occurs via attack of both methanol and the aldehydes by oxygen. The mechanistic model constructed in this study provides insight into factors that control selectivity and clearly elucidates the crucial role of Au nanoparticles as active species in the catalytic oxidation of alcohols, even in solution. Many synthetic processes rely on the ability to selectively couple oxygenated molecules. Here a study of low-temperature selective cross-coupling of aldehydes with methanol on a gold surface is presented. The results allow the construction of a mechanistic model for such coupling reactions that will be applicable under a wide range of reaction conditions.

The role of long-lived reactive oxygen intermediates in the reaction of ozone with aerosol particles

The heterogeneous reactions of O3 with aerosol particles are of central importance to air quality. They are studied extensively, but the molecular mechanisms and kinetics remain unresolved. Based on new experimental data and calculations, we show that long-lived reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) are formed. The chemical lifetime of these intermediates exceeds 100 seconds, which is much longer than the surface residence time of molecular O3 (~10−9&nbsp;s). The ROIs explain and resolve apparent discrepancies between earlier quantum mechanical calculations and kinetic experiments. They play a key role in the chemical transformation and adverse health effects of toxic and allergenic air-particulate matter, such as soot, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and proteins. ROIs may also be involved in the decomposition of O3 on mineral dust and in the formation and growth of secondary organic aerosols. Moreover, ROIs may contribute to the coupling of atmospheric and biospheric multiphase processes. It is shown that long-lived reactive oxygen intermediates are formed in heterogeneous reactions of ozone with aerosol particles, resolving apparent discrepancies between earlier quantum mechanical calculations and kinetic experiments. These intermediates play a key role in the chemical transformations and adverse health effects of toxic and allergenic air particulates.

Chemically blockable transformation and ultraselective low-pressure gas adsorption in a non-porous metal organic framework

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most exciting materials discovered recently, attracting particular attention for their gas-adsorption and -storage properties. Certain MOFs show considerable structural flexibility in response to various stimuli. Although there are several examples of ‘breathing’ MOFs, in which structural changes occur without any bond breaking, examples of transformations in which several bonds are broken and made are much rarer. In this paper we demonstrate how a flexible MOF, Cu2(OH)(C8H3O7S)(H2O)·2H2O, can be synthesized by careful choice of the organic linker ligand. The flexibility can be controlled by addition of a supplementary coordinating molecule, which increases the thermal stability of the solid sufficiently for direct imaging with electron microscopy to be possible. We also demonstrate that the MOF shows unprecedented low-pressure selectivity towards nitric oxide through a coordination-driven gating mechanism. The chemical control over these behaviours offers new possibilities for the synthesis of MOFs with unusual and potentially exploitable properties. Materials formed by linking metal ions with organic ligands have potential for gas adsorption and storage, and can be flexible in response to stimuli. Now, suitable organic linkers result in a material that undergoes a large structural change, but does not lose crystallinity.

Efficient enzyme-free copying of all four nucleobases templated by immobilized RNA

The transition from inanimate materials to the earliest forms of life must have involved multiplication of a catalytically active polymer that is able to replicate. The semiconservative replication that is characteristic of genetic information transfer requires strands that contain more than one type of nucleobase. Short strands of RNA can act as catalysts, but attempts to induce efficient self-copying of mixed sequences (containing four different nucleobases) have been unsuccessful with ribonucleotides. Here we show that inhibition by spent monomers, formed by the hydrolysis of the activated nucleotides, is the cause for incomplete extension of growing daughter strands on RNA templates. Immobilization of strands and periodic displacement of the solution containing the activated monomers overcome this inhibition. Any of the four nucleobases (A/C/G/U) is successfully copied in the absence of enzymes. We conclude therefore that in a prebiotic world, oligoribonucleotides may have formed and undergone self-copying on surfaces. A long-standing problem with the RNA-world hypothesis is that enzyme-free replication of RNA strands has not been demonstrated. Here, immobilization of a template strand and periodic replacement of a solution containing activated nucleotides allows the copying of unmodified RNA sequences containing any of the four natural nucleobases in near-quantitative yield.

Exploring local currents in molecular junctions

Electron transfer through molecules is an ubiquitous process underlying the function of biological systems and synthetic devices. The electronic coupling between components varies with the structure of the molecular bridge, often in classically unintuitive ways, as determined by its quantum electronic structure. Considerable efforts in electron-transfer theory have yielded models that are useful conceptually and provide quantitative means to understand transfer rates in terms of local contributions. Here we show how a description of the local currents within a bridging molecule bound to metallic electrodes can provide chemical insight into current flow. In particular, we show that through-space, as opposed to through-bond, terms dominate in a surprising number of instances, and that interference effects can be characterized by the reversal of ring currents. Together these ideas have implications for the design of molecular electronic devices, in particular for the ways in which substituent effects may be used for maximum impact. A methodology for describing local electronic transmission through bridging molecules between metallic electrodes is presented. Its application to simple alkane, phenyl and cross-conjugated systems highlights an unexpected number of cases whereby ‘through space’, rather than ‘through bond’ terms dominate and that interference effects coincide with the reversal of ring currents.

Experimental evidence for the functional relevance of anion–π interactions

Attractive in theory and confirmed to exist, anion–π interactions have never really been seen at work. To catch them in action, we prepared a collection of monomeric, cyclic and rod-shaped naphthalenediimide transporters. Their ability to exert anion–π interactions was demonstrated by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in combination with theoretical calculations. To relate this structural evidence to transport activity in bilayer membranes, affinity and selectivity sequences were recorded. π-acidification and active-site decrowding increased binding, transport and chloride&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;bromide&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;iodide selectivity, and supramolecular organization inverted acetate&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;nitrate to nitrate&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;acetate selectivity. We conclude that anion–π interactions on monomeric surfaces are ideal for chloride recognition, whereas their supramolecular enhancement by π,π-interactions appears perfect to target nitrate. Chloride transporters are relevant to treat channelopathies, and nitrate sensors to monitor cellular signaling and cardiovascular diseases. A big impact on organocatalysis can be expected from the stabilization of anionic transition states on chiral π-acidic surfaces. For quadrupole moments up to +39 Buckinghams, increasing π-acidity of aromatic surfaces is shown to cause tighter anion binding in tandem mass spectrometry experiments, higher binding energies in molecular models, stronger charge-transfer absorption bands, and increasingly effective and selective anion transport across lipid-bilayer membranes.

Core@shell bimetallic nanoparticle synthesis via anion coordination

Core@shell structured bimetallic nanoparticles are currently of immense interest due to their unique electronic, optical and catalytic properties. However, their synthesis is non-trivial. We report a new supramolecular route for the synthesis of core@shell nanoparticles, based on an anion coordination protocol—the first to function by binding the shell metal to the surface of the pre-formed primary metal core before reduction. The resultant gold/palladium and platinum/palladium core@shell nanoparticles have been characterized by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (as well as other techniques), giving striking atomic-resolution images of the core@shell architecture, and the unique catalytic properties of the structured nanoparticles have been demonstrated in a remarkable improvement of the selective production of industrially valuable chloroaniline from chloronitrobenzene. Bimetallic core@shell nanoparticles often have properties that are different from those of single-metal or alloy nanoparticles. Here, a route to such nanoparticles that binds the second metal to the core surface prior to reduction is described. The unique catalytic properties of the nanoparticles are demonstrated in the selective production of chloroaniline.

Biocatalytic induction of supramolecular order

Supramolecular gels, which demonstrate tunable functionalities, have attracted much interest in a range of areas, including healthcare, environmental protection and energy-related technologies. Preparing these materials in a reliable manner is challenging, with an increased level of kinetic defects observed at higher self-assembly rates. Here, by combining biocatalysis and molecular self-assembly, we have shown the ability to more quickly access higher-ordered structures. By simply increasing enzyme concentration, supramolecular order expressed at molecular, nano- and micro-levels is dramatically enhanced, and, importantly, the gelator concentrations remain identical. Amphiphile molecules were prepared by attaching an aromatic moiety to a dipeptide backbone capped with a methyl ester. Their self-assembly was induced by an enzyme that hydrolysed the ester. Different enzyme concentrations altered the catalytic activity and size of the enzyme clusters, affecting their mobility. This allowed structurally diverse materials that represent local minima in the free energy landscape to be accessed based on a single gelator structure. Supramolecular gels show promise in diverse areas, including healthcare and energy technologies, owing to tunable properties that arise directly from the organization of their building blocks. Researchers have now been able to control this behaviour by combining enzymatic catalysis with molecular self-assembly. Although it seems counter-intuitive, gels that assembled faster showed fewer defects.

Charge-transfer-induced structural rearrangements at both sides of organic/metal interfaces

Organic/metal interfaces control the performance of many optoelectronic organic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes or field-effect transistors. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we show that electron transfer at the interface between a metal surface and the organic electron acceptor tetracyano-p-quinodimethane leads to substantial structural rearrangements on both the organic and metallic sides of the interface. These structural modifications mediate new intermolecular interactions through the creation of stress fields that could not have been predicted on the basis of gas-phase neutral tetracyano-p-quinodimethane conformation. Interfaces between organic molecules and metal surfaces have a key role in determining the performance of many emerging technologies. Now an intensive experimental study — supported by calculations — of tetracyano-p-quinodimethane molecules on a copper surface, reveals structural rearrangement of both the organic molecules and the surface atoms after charge transfer across the interface.

Charge transfer to solvent identified using dark channel fluorescence-yield L-edge spectroscopy

Aqueous ions are central to catalysis and biological function and play an important role in radiation biology as sources of damage-inducing electrons. Detailed knowledge of solute–solvent interactions is therefore crucial. For transition-metal ions, soft X-ray L-edge spectroscopy allows access to d orbitals, which are involved in chemical bonding. Using this technique, we show that the fluorescence-yield spectra of aqueous ionic species exhibit additional features compared with those of non-aqueous solvents. Some features dip below the fluorescence background of the solvent and this is rationalized by the competition between the fluorescence yields of the solute and solvent species, and between the solute radiative (fluorescence) and non-radiative channels; in particular, electron transfer to the water molecules. This method allows us to determine the nature, directionality and timescale of the electron transfer. Remarkably, we observe such features even for fully ligated metal atoms, which indicates a direct interaction with the water molecules. A detailed understanding of solute–solvent interactions is crucial to appreciating the important role aqueous ions play in various biological and catalytic processes. Now soft X-ray spectroscopy reveals new features in aqueous ion spectra that are due to solute–solvent interaction and electron transfer.

Computational evidence that hyperconjugative interactions are not responsible for the anomeric effect

The ‘anomeric effect’ is the thermodynamic preference for polar substituents to occupy the axial position in the chair conformation of various heterocycles. The most common explanation given for this effect at present is hyperconjugation from the lone pairs on the ring heteroatom to the antibonding orbital between the anomeric carbon and its linking substituent. Alternatively, the anomeric effect could be explained by intramolecular electrostatic interactions between local dipoles. Few models can provide convincing data for either theory at the quantum-mechanical level. Now, using the extended block-localized wavefunction method, which is the simplest form of valence bond theory, we have evaluated the degree of hyperconjugation in various compounds that display the anomeric effect and have interpreted their conformational preferences in terms of steric, hyperconjugation and dispersion effects. The results provide strong evidence that hyperconjugative interactions are not responsible for the anomeric effect and that it is better interpreted in terms of electrostatic interactions. The anomeric effect, which influences the position of polar substituents in the chair conformation of various heterocycles, is commonly rationalized using hyperconjugation. Now, by theoretically studying molecules that display the anomeric effect, strong evidence is provided that hyperconjugation is not responsible and it is better interpreted in terms of electrostatics.

Control and imaging of O(1D2) precession

Larmor precession of a quantum mechanical angular momentum vector about an applied magnetic field forms the basis for a range of magnetic resonance techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. We have used a polarized laser pump–probe scheme with velocity-map imaging detection to visualize, for the first time, the precessional motion of a quantum mechanical angular momentum vector. Photodissociation of O2 at 157&nbsp;nm provides a clean source of fast-moving O(1D2) atoms, with their electronic angular momentum vector strongly aligned perpendicular to the recoil direction. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the distribution of atomic angular momenta precesses about the field direction, and polarization-sensitive images of the atomic scattering distribution recorded as a function of field strength yield ‘time-lapse-photography’ style movies of the precessional motion. We present movies recorded in various experimental geometries, and discuss potential consequences and applications in atmospheric chemistry and reaction dynamics. Larmor precession of a quantum mechanical angular momentum vector about an applied magnetic field forms the basis for NMR spectroscopy, MRI and a range of other important analytical techniques. This precessional motion has now been imaged for the first time, using velocity-map imaging in a model system of strongly polarized oxygen atoms.

Converting homogeneous to heterogeneous in electrophilic catalysis using monodisperse metal nanoparticles

A continuing goal in catalysis is to unite the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes. To this end, nanoparticles represent a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, where this unification can also be supplemented by the ability to obtain new or divergent reactivity and selectivity. We report a novel method for applying heterogeneous catalysts to known homogeneous catalytic reactions through the design and synthesis of electrophilic platinum nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are selectively oxidized by the hypervalent iodine species PhICl2, and catalyse a range of π-bond activation reactions previously only catalysed through homogeneous processes. Multiple experimental methods are used to unambiguously verify the heterogeneity of the catalytic process. The discovery of treatments for nanoparticles that induce the desired homogeneous catalytic activity should lead to the further development of reactions previously inaccessible in heterogeneous catalysis. Furthermore, a size and capping agent study revealed that Pt PAMAM dendrimer-capped nanoparticles demonstrate superior activity and recyclability compared with larger, polymer-capped analogues. Combining the benefits of homogeneous and heterogeneous processes may lead to important advances in catalysis. This has now been achieved using selectively oxidized and supported electrophilic platinum nanoparticles that catalyse a range of π-bond activation reactions previously only catalysed homogeneously.

A renewable amine for photochemical reduction of CO2

Photochemical reduction of CO2 (to produce formic acid) can be seen both as a method to produce a transportable hydrogen-based fuel and also to reduce levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. However, an often overlooked necessity for photochemical CO2 reduction is the need for a sacrificial electron donor, usually a tertiary amine. Here, we describe a new strategy for coupling the photochemical reduction of CO2 to photochemical water splitting, and illustrate this with a prototype example. Instead of seeking to eliminate the use of an external reducing agent altogether, our alternative strategy makes the reducing agent recyclable. This has two potential advantages over the direct coupling of CO2 reduction and water oxidation. First, it allows the two redox reactions to be carried out with existing chemistry, and second, it permits these reactions to be conducted under mutually incompatible conditions. Photochemical reduction of CO2 usually requires the use of a sacrificial electron donor (reductant). Here, a tertiary amine reductant is described that can be regenerated by H2 addition. This permits the formal coupling of CO2 reduction to photochemical water splitting, thereby offering an approach to artificial photosynthesis.

Anisotropic oxygen diffusion at low temperature in perovskite-structure iron oxides

Oxygen-ion conduction in transition-metal oxides is exploited in, for example, electrolytes in solid-oxide fuel cells and oxygen-separation membranes, which currently work at high temperatures. Conduction at low temperature is a key to developing further utilization, and an understanding of the structures that enable conduction is also important to gain insight into oxygen-diffusion pathways. Here we report the structural changes observed when single-crystalline, epitaxial CaFeO2.5 thin films were changed into CaFeO2 by low-temperature reductions with CaH2. During the reduction process from the brownmillerite CaFeO2.5 into the infinite-layer structure of CaFeO2, some of the oxygen atoms are released from and others are rearranged within the perovskite-structure framework. We evaluated these changes and the reaction time they required, and found two oxygen diffusion pathways and the related kinetics at low temperature. The results demonstrate that oxygen diffusion in the brownmillerite is highly anisotropic, significantly higher along the lateral direction of the tetrahedral and octahedral layers. The movement of oxygen ions through materials is important in electrolytes and separation membranes, but is rare at lower temperatures. Two different low-temperature diffusion pathways are revealed during the reduction process of CaFeO2.5 to CaFeO2. The two pathways are significantly different, resulting in anisotropy.

Amyloid-β protein oligomerization and the importance of tetramers and dodecamers in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease

In recent years, small protein oligomers have been implicated in the aetiology of a number of important amyloid diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. As a consequence, research efforts are being directed away from traditional targets, such as amyloid plaques, and towards characterization of early oligomer states. Here we present a new analysis method, ion mobility coupled with mass spectrometry, for this challenging problem, which allows determination of in vitro oligomer distributions and the qualitative structure of each of the aggregates. We applied these methods to a number of the amyloid-β protein isoforms of Aβ40 and Aβ42 and showed that their oligomer-size distributions are very different. Our results are consistent with previous observations that Aβ40 and Aβ42 self-assemble via different pathways and provide a candidate in the Aβ42 dodecamer for the primary toxic species in Alzheimer's disease. Ion-mobility mass spectrometry has been used to identify and characterize the oligomeric assemblies of amyloid-β proteins under physiologically relevant conditions. Hexamers and dodecamers are formed only from Aβ42 proteins and the dodecamer is identified as a candidate for the primary toxic agent in the development of Alzheimer's disease.

Title: 
An optoelectronic nose for the detection of toxic gases

We have developed a simple colorimetric sensor array that detects a wide range of volatile analytes and then applied it to the detection of toxic gases. The sensor consists of a disposable array of cross-responsive nanoporous pigments with colours that are changed by diverse chemical interactions with analytes. Although no single chemically responsive pigment is specific for any one analyte, the pattern of colour change for the array is a unique molecular fingerprint. Clear differentiation among 19 different toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) within two minutes of exposure at concentrations immediately dangerous to life or health were demonstrated. Based on the colour change of the array, quantification of each analyte was accomplished easily, and excellent detection limits were achieved, generally below the permissible exposure limits. Different TICs were identified readily using a standard chemometric approach (hierarchical clustering analysis), with no misclassifications over 140 trials. Industrial chemicals can pose serious health risks in the workplace, and monitoring them is of vital importance. Researchers now show that an optoelectronic nose based on a colorimetric sensor array of nanoporous pigments can rapidly identify a wide range of toxic gases at their IDLH (immediately dangerous to life or health) concentrations.

Title: 
Programmable molecular recognition based on the geometry of DNA nanostructures

From ligand–receptor binding to DNA hybridization, molecular recognition plays a central role in biology. Over the past several decades, chemists have successfully reproduced the exquisite specificity of biomolecular interactions. However, engineering multiple specific interactions in synthetic systems remains difficult. DNA retains its position as the best medium with which to create orthogonal, isoenergetic interactions, based on the complementarity of Watson–Crick binding. Here we show that DNA can be used to create diverse bonds using an entirely different principle: the geometric arrangement of blunt-end stacking interactions. We show that both binary codes and shape complementarity can serve as a basis for such stacking bonds, and explore their specificity, thermodynamics and binding rules. Orthogonal stacking bonds were used to connect five distinct DNA origami. This work, which demonstrates how a single attractive interaction can be developed to create diverse bonds, may guide strategies for molecular recognition in systems beyond DNA nanostructures. Multiple specific binding interactions have typically been created from DNA using Watson–Crick complementarity. Now, diverse bonds have also been obtained through the geometric arrangement of blunt-end stacking interactions. Two approaches to specific interactions — binary and shape coding — are demonstrated. The thermodynamics and binding rules of the resulting ‘stacking bonds’ are explored.

Observation of Fe(V)=O using variable-temperature mass spectrometry and its enzyme-like C–H and C=C oxidation reactions

Oxo-transfer chemistry mediated by iron underpins many biological processes and today is emerging as synthetically very important for the catalytic oxidation of C–H and C=C moieties that are hard to activate conventionally. Despite the vast amount of research in this area, experimental characterization of the reactive species under catalytic conditions is very limited, although a Fe(V)=O moiety was postulated. Here we show, using variable-temperature mass spectrometry, the generation of a Fe(V)=O species within a synthetic non-haem complex at −40&nbsp;°C and its reaction with an olefin. Also, with isotopic labelling we were able both to follow oxygen-atom transfer from H2O2/H2O through Fe(V)=O to the products and to probe the reactivity as a function of temperature. This study pioneers the implementation of variable-temperature mass spectrometry to investigate reactive intermediates. Variable-temperature mass spectrometry, isotopic labelling and computational analysis have been used to characterize a metastable non-haem oxo-iron(V) intermediate generated at cryogenic temperatures, as well as to study its cis-dihydroxylation reaction with olefins. The study provides experimental evidence for the existence of this powerful and biologically important oxidant, under conditions relevant to catalysis.

Title: 
Halogen bonds as orthogonal molecular interactions to hydrogen bonds

Halogen bonds (X-bonds) are shown to be geometrically perpendicular to and energetically independent of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) that share a common carbonyl oxygen acceptor. This orthogonal relationship is accommodated by the in-plane and out-of-plane electronegative potentials of the oxygen, which are differentially populated by H- and X-bonds. Furthermore, the local conformation of a peptide helps to define the geometry of the H-bond and thus the oxygen surface that is accessible for X-bonding. These electrostatic and steric forces conspire to impose a strong preference for the orthogonal geometry of X- and H-bonds. Thus, the optimum geometry of an X-bond can be predicted from the pattern of H-bonds in a folded protein, enabling X-bonds to be introduced to improve ligand affinities without disrupting these structurally important interactions. This concept of orthogonal molecular interactions can be exploited for the rational design of halogenated ligands as inhibitors and drugs, and in biomolecular engineering. A survey of protein–ligand complexes shows that hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds that share a common oxygen-atom acceptor are often geometrically perpendicular to one another. Moreover, theoretical studies on small-molecule models of such systems predict that these two interactions are energetically independent.

Anion-switchable supramolecular gels for controlling pharmaceutical crystal growth

We describe the use of low-molecular-weight supramolecular gels as media for the growth of molecular crystals. Growth of a range of crystals of organic compounds, including pharmaceuticals, was achieved in bis(urea) gels. Low-molecular-weight supramolecular gelators allow access to an unlimited range of solvent systems, in contrast to conventional aqueous gels such as gelatin and agarose. A detailed study of carbamazepine crystal growth in four different bis(urea) gelators, including a metallogelator, is reported. The crystallization of a range of other drug substances, namely sparfloxacin, piroxicam, theophylline, caffeine, ibuprofen, acetaminophen (paracetamol), sulindac and indomethacin, was also achieved in supramolecular gel media without co-crystal formation. In many cases, crystals can be conveniently recovered from the gels by using supramolecular anion-triggered gel dissolution; however, crystals of substances that themselves bind to anions are dissolved by them. Overall, supramolecular gel-phase crystallization offers an extremely versatile new tool in pharmaceutical polymorph screening. Supramolecular gels based on small-molecule gelators have been shown to be effective media for the growth of organic crystals, including pharmaceutical compounds. Moreover, the gel-to-sol transition can be triggered by molecular recognition with anions, thereby enabling facile recovery of the crystals.

Title: 
Platinum nanocrystals selectively shaped using facet-specific peptide sequences

The properties of a nanocrystal are heavily influenced by its shape. Shape control of a colloidal nanocrystal is believed to be a kinetic process, with high-energy facets growing faster then vanishing, leading to nanocrystals enclosed by low-energy facets. Identifying a surfactant that can specifically bind to a particular crystal facet is critical, but has proved challenging to date. Biomolecules have exquisite specific molecular recognition properties that can be explored for the precise engineering of nanostructured materials. Here, we report the use of facet-specific peptide sequences as regulating agents for the predictable synthesis of platinum nanocrystals with selectively exposed crystal surfaces and particular shapes. The formation of platinum nanocubes and nanotetrahedrons are demonstrated with Pt-{100} and Pt-{111} binding peptides, respectively. Our studies unambiguously demonstrate the abilities of facet-selective binding peptides in determining nanocrystal shape, representing a critical step forward in the use of biomolecules for programmable synthesis of nanostructures. Crystal growth in nature is controlled by biomolecules to produce precisely engineered crystal shapes. Now, facet-specific peptide sequences that have been rationally selected through a biomimetic evolution process are used as regulating agents for predictable synthesis of platinum nanocrystals with selectively exposed crystal surfaces.

Title: 
Triggering N2 uptake via redox-induced expulsion of coordinated NH3 and N2 silylation at trigonal bipyramidal iron

The biological reduction of N2 to give NH3 may occur by one of two predominant pathways in which nitrogenous NxHy intermediates, including hydrazine (N2H4), diazene (N2H2), nitride (N3−) and imide (NH2−), may be involved. To test the validity of hypotheses on iron's direct role in the stepwise reduction of N2, model systems for iron are needed. Such systems can test the chemical compatibility of iron with various proposed NxHy intermediates and the reactivity patterns of such species. Here we describe a trigonal bipyramidal Si(o-C6H4PR2)3Fe–L scaffold (R&nbsp;=&nbsp;Ph or i-Pr) in which the apical site is occupied by nitrogenous ligands such as N2, N2H4, NH3 and N2R. The system accommodates terminally bound N2 in the three formal oxidation states (iron(0), +1 and +2). N2 uptake is demonstrated by the displacement of its reduction partners NH3 and N2H4, and N2 functionalizaton is illustrated by electrophilic silylation. In nature, iron takes a direct role in converting nitrogen to ammonia through a variety of NxHy intermediates. A series of synthetic iron complexes that mimic these intermediates could lead to an increased understanding of the process and eventually to effective catalysts.

Efficient water oxidation at carbon nanotube–polyoxometalate electrocatalytic interfaces

Water is the renewable, bulk chemical that nature uses to enable carbohydrate production from carbon dioxide. The dream goal of energy research is to transpose this incredibly efficient process and make an artificial device whereby the catalytic splitting of water is finalized to give a continuous production of oxygen and hydrogen. Success in this task would guarantee the generation of hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel to satisfy our energy demands at no environmental cost. Here we show that very efficient and stable nanostructured, oxygen-evolving anodes are obtained by the assembly of an oxygen-evolving polyoxometalate cluster (a totally inorganic ruthenium catalyst) with a conducting bed of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Our bioinspired electrode addresses the one major challenge of artificial photosynthesis, namely efficient water oxidation, which brings us closer to being able to power the planet with carbon-free fuels. Catalytically oxidizing water to produce oxygen is so challenging that even the enzyme that performs the task in nature must be regenerated every 30 mins. Now, stable oxygen-evolving anodes have been made by tethering a polyoxometalate catalyst to a conducting bed of carbon nanotubes.

Title: 
Preparation of functionalized organoaluminiums by direct insertion of aluminium to unsaturated halides

The preparation of polyfunctional organometallics is important in organic synthesis as these reagents are very popular nucleophiles. The preparation of functionalized aluminium reagents by direct insertion of aluminium powder is in general not possible. Such a reaction would be of special importance owing to the low price of aluminium compared with magnesium (it is half the price), the low toxicity of this metal and the chemoselectivity of the resultant organoaluminium reagents. We have now found that by adding catalytic amounts of selected metallic chlorides (TiCl4, BiCl3, InCl3 or PbCl2) in the presence of LiCl, aluminium powder inserts into various unsaturated iodides and bromides under mild conditions. These resulting new organoaluminium reagents undergo smooth Pd-catalysed cross-coupling and acylation reactions, as well as copper-catalysed allylic substitutions, affording various interesting products for pharmaceutical and material science applications. The reactivity of organoaluminium reagents makes them particularly attractive nucleophiles for a wide range of organic reactions. Here, the use of metal halide catalysts provides access to functionalized organoaluminium reagents directly from the metal. The utility of these organoaluminium reagents is then demonstrated by their reaction with a wide variety of electrophilic coupling partners.

Title: 
Surface-mediated chain reaction through dissociative attachment

Chain reactions on a surface offer an important route to linear nanopatterning. We recently reported cooperative reactions on a silicon surface in which the reaction of one halogen atom with a silicon atom of a silicon dimer induced the halogenation of its neighbouring silicon atom through surface-mediated charge transfer. The reaction was unable to propagate further but here we describe how, by chemically bridging the gaps between the rows of these silicon dimers, this mechanism is able to form extended chains. The agents for chain growth are CH3Cl molecules that dissociatively attach CH3 groups and chlorine atoms to silicon atoms from different dimers. By means of charge transfer through the surface, this gives rise to dangling bonds adjacent to the CH3 groups and chlorine atoms (in effect, ‘free radicals’) that dissociate further incoming CH3Cl molecules, thereby providing the growing points for chains of indefinite length. This versatile mechanism of chain growth is examined in experiments and using ab initio theory. Chain-reactions could provide an alternative method for surface patterning. Now the chain reaction of CH3Cl molecules on a silicon surface has been observed to create lines that are made up of alternating CH3 groups and Cl atoms. The reactions are propagated through surface-mediated charge-transfer and have been studied using microscopy and ab initio theory.

Isolation of a radical dianion of nitrogen oxide (NO)2−

Nitric oxide, NO, the diatomic hybrid of dinitrogen and dioxygen, has extensive biochemical, industrial and atmospheric chemistry. The unpaired electron on NO makes it highly reactive and its facile oxidation and reduction to make (NO)1+ and (NO)1−, respectively, have been heavily studied. Now the (NO)2− dianion has been isolated for the first time from the two-electron reduction of NO by the recently discovered (N2)3− yttrium complex {[(Me3Si)2N]2(THF)Y}2(µ3-η2:η2:η2-N2)K. NO reacts with this complex to form {[(Me3Si)2N]2(THF)Y}2(µ-η2:η2-NO), a paramagnetic complex that has an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum definitive for the (NO)2− radical. Density functional theory reveals that a metal dπ to ligand π* interaction is crucial for the stability of this complex, which reacts with additional NO to generate the diamagnetic (ON=NO)2− product, {[(Me3Si)2N]2Y}4(µ3-ON=NO)2(THF)2. Nitric oxide, NO, has an unpaired electron and is widely used and studied in such diverse fields as biochemistry and atmospheric chemistry. Its radical nature means that singly charged species are common, but now two electrons have been added to give a radical dianion in an yttrium complex.

Pressure-induced bonding and compound formation in xenon–hydrogen solids

Closed electron shell systems, such as hydrogen, nitrogen or group 18 elements, can form weakly bound stoichiometric compounds at high pressures. An understanding of the stability of these van der Waals compounds is lacking, as is information on the nature of their interatomic interactions. We describe the formation of a stable compound in the Xe–H2 binary system, revealed by a suite of X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy measurements. At 4.8&nbsp;GPa, a unique hydrogen-rich structure forms that can be viewed as a tripled solid hydrogen lattice modulated by layers of xenon, consisting of xenon dimers. Varying the applied pressure tunes the Xe–Xe distances in the solid over a broad range from that of an expanded xenon lattice to the distances observed in metallic xenon at megabar pressures. Infrared and Raman spectra indicate a weakening of the intramolecular covalent bond as well as persistence of semiconducting behaviour in the compound to at least 255&nbsp;GPa. Both hydrogen and xenon form unusual phases at very high pressures. Researchers have now observed that an unexpectedly stable compound forms when a hydrogen-rich mixture of the two gases is subjected to pressures in the gigapascal range. Xenon dimers and other unusual bonding states are revealed in this compound, which is stable to megabar pressures.

Activating efficient phosphorescence from purely organic materials by crystal design

Phosphorescence is among the many functional features that, in practice, divide pure organic compounds from organometallics and inorganics. Considered to be practically non-phosphorescent, purely organic compounds (metal-free) are very rarely explored as emitters in phosphor applications, despite the emerging demand in this field. To defy this paradigm, we describe novel design principles to create purely organic materials demonstrating phosphorescence that can be turned on by incorporating halogen bonding into their crystals. By designing chromophores to contain triplet-producing aromatic aldehydes and triplet-promoting bromine, crystal-state halogen bonding can be made to direct the heavy atom effect to produce surprisingly efficient solid-state phosphorescence. When this chromophore is diluted into the crystal of a bi-halogenated, non-carbonyl analogue, ambient phosphorescent quantum yields reach 55%. Here, using this design, a series of pure organic phosphors are colour-tuned to emit blue, green, yellow and orange. From this initial discovery, a directed heavy atom design principle is demonstrated that will allow for the development of bright and practical purely organic phosphors. Purely organic materials are usually considered non-phosphorescent. Here, a crystal design that relies on the formation of halogen bonds is used to combine the heavy-atom effect with the triplet-state emission from aromatic carbonyls to produce organic crystals with bright phosphorescence of the type formerly observed only from inorganic and organometallic materials.

Title: 
Total synthesis and study of 6-deoxyerythronolide B by late-stage C–H oxidation

Among the frontier challenges in chemistry in the twenty-first century are the interconnected goals of increasing synthetic efficiency and diversity in the construction of complex molecules. Oxidation reactions of C–H bonds, particularly when applied at late stages of complex molecule syntheses, hold special promise for achieving both these goals. Here we report a late-stage C–H oxidation strategy in the total synthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB), the aglycone precursor to the erythromycin antibiotics. An advanced intermediate is cyclized to give the 14-membered macrocyclic core of 6-dEB using a late-stage (step 19 of 22) C–H oxidative macrolactonization reaction that proceeds with high regio-, chemo- and diastereoselectivity (&gt;40:1). A chelate-controlled model for macrolactonization predicted the stereochemical outcome of C–O bond formation and guided the discovery of conditions for synthesizing the first diastereomeric 13-epi-6-dEB precursor. Overall, this C–H oxidation strategy affords a highly efficient and stereochemically versatile synthesis of the erythromycin core. A synthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B is reported that uses a late-stage C–H oxidative macrocyclization reaction to forge the key macrocyclic core found in the erythromycins. By installing oxygen at a late-stage, this strategy improves synthetic efficiency by minimizing the ‘oxygen load’, and provides stereochemical versatility at the site of oxidation.

Catalytic behaviour of dense hot water

Water is known to exhibit fascinating physical properties at high pressure and temperature. Its remarkable structural and phase complexities suggest the possibility of exotic chemical reactivity under extreme conditions, although this remains largely unstudied. Detonations of high explosives containing oxygen and hydrogen produce water at thousands of kelvin and tens of gigapascals, similar to conditions in the interiors of giant planets. These systems thus provide a unique means of elucidating the chemistry of ‘extreme water’. Here, we show that water has an unexpected role in catalysing complex explosive reactions—contrary to the current view that it is simply a stable detonation product. Using first-principles atomistic simulations of the detonation of the high explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate, we discovered that H2O (source), H (reducer) and OH (oxidizer) act as a dynamic team that transports oxygen between reaction centres. Our finding suggests that water may catalyse reactions in other explosives and in planetary interiors. Water can behave in unexpected ways at high pressure and temperature. Simulations of the detonation of a high explosive show that ‘extreme’ water can act as a chemical catalyst that promotes the transport of oxygen between reactive sites — contrary to the current view of water as a stable final product.

Title: 
Designer magnetic superatoms

The quantum states in metal clusters are grouped into bunches of close-lying eigenvalues, termed electronic shells, similar to those of atoms. Filling of the electronic shells with paired electrons results in local minima in energy to give stable species called magic clusters. This led to the realization that selected clusters mimic chemical properties of elemental atoms on the periodic table and can be classified as superatoms. So far the work on superatoms has focused on non-magnetic species. Here we propose a framework for magnetic superatoms by invoking systems that have both localized and delocalized electronic states, in which localized electrons stabilize magnetic moments and filled nearly-free electron shells lead to stable species. An isolated VCs8 and a ligated MnAu24(SH)18 are shown to be such magnetic superatoms. The magnetic superatoms' assemblies could be ideal for molecular electronic devices, as the coupling could be altered by charging or weak fields. Some clusters of atoms, such as Al13−, can behave as though they are themselves atoms. Most of these ‘superatoms’ have filled shells of paired electrons, but calculations now suggest that a vanadium–caesium cluster with a partially filled d-shell acts like manganese, displaying magnetic properties.

Efficient water oxidation catalysts based on readily available iron coordination complexes

Water oxidation catalysis constitutes the bottleneck for the development of energy-conversion schemes based on sunlight. To date, state-of-the-art homogeneous water oxidation catalysis is performed efficiently with expensive, toxic and earth-scarce transition metals, but 3d metal-based catalysts are much less established. Here we show that readily available, environmentally benign iron coordination complexes catalyse homogeneous water oxidation to give O2, with high efficiency during a period of hours. Turnover numbers &gt;350 and &gt;1,000 were obtained using cerium ammonium nitrate at pH 1 and sodium periodate at pH 2, respectively. Spectroscopic monitoring of the catalytic reactions, in combination with kinetic studies, show that high valent oxo-iron species are responsible for the O–O forming event. A systematic study of iron complexes that contain a broad family of neutral tetradentate organic ligands identifies first-principle structural features to sustain water oxidation catalysis. Iron-based catalysts described herein open a novel strategy that could eventually enable sustainable artificial photosynthetic schemes. One of the bottlenecks for the development of sustainable artificial photosynthesis is the water oxidation reaction, which too often relies on expensive and toxic metals. Now, coordination complexes of readily available, environmentally benign iron are found to catalyse homogeneous water oxidation to O2 with high efficiency.

Formation of mixed-phase particles during the freezing of polar stratospheric ice clouds

Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are extremely efficient at catalysing the transformation of photostable chlorine reservoirs into photolabile species, which are actively involved in springtime ozone-depletion events. Why PSCs are such efficient catalysts, however, is not well understood. Here, we investigate the freezing behaviour of ternary HNO3–H2SO4–H2O droplets of micrometric size, which form type II PSC ice particles. We show that on freezing, a phase separation into pure ice and a residual solution coating occurs; this coating does not freeze but transforms into glass below ∼150 K. We find that the coating, which is thicker around young ice crystals, can still be approximately 30&nbsp;nm around older ice crystals of diameter about 10&nbsp;µm. These results affect our understanding of PSC microphysics and chemistry and suggest that chlorine-activation reactions are better studied on supercooled HNO3–H2SO4–H2O solutions rather than on a pure ice surface. Chlorine-activation reactions on polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles are crucial to ozone depletion in the winter/spring polar stratosphere and their rates depend on the phase state of the PSC particle surface. Now experiments show that, on particle formation, a phase separation into pure ice with a residual solution coating takes place.

Quantum size effects in ambient CO oxidation catalysed by ligand-protected gold clusters

Finely dispersed nanometre-scale gold particles are known to catalyse several oxidation reactions in aerobic, ambient conditions. The catalytic activity has been explained by various complementary mechanisms, including support effects, particle-size-dependent metal–insulator transition, charging effects, frontier orbital interactions and geometric fluxionality. We show, by considering a series of robust and structurally well-characterized ligand-protected gold clusters with diameters between 1.2 and 2.4&nbsp;nm, that electronic quantum size effects, particularly the magnitude of the so-called HOMO–LUMO energy gap, has a decisive role in binding oxygen to the nano-catalyst in an activated form. This can lead to the oxidation reaction 2CO&nbsp;+&nbsp;O2&nbsp;→&nbsp;2CO2 with low activation barriers. Binding of dioxygen is significant only for the smallest particles with a metal core diameter clearly below 2&nbsp;nm. Our results suggest a potentially viable route to practical applications using ligand-protected gold clusters for green chemistry. Gold nanoparticles can catalyse oxidation reactions in remarkably mild conditions and have excited much interest in recent years. With experimental studies disagreeing over the size of the most active nanoparticles, density functional calculations have now shown that limiting the particle size to below two nanometres is crucial.

Raising the cycling stability of aqueous lithium-ion batteries by eliminating oxygen in the electrolyte

Aqueous lithium-ion batteries may solve the safety problem associated with lithium-ion batteries that use highly toxic and flammable organic solvents, and the poor cycling life associated with commercialized aqueous rechargeable batteries such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride systems. But all reported aqueous lithium-ion battery systems have shown poor stability: the capacity retention is typically less than 50% after 100 cycles. Here, the stability of electrode materials in an aqueous electrolyte was extensively analysed. The negative electrodes of aqueous lithium-ion batteries in a discharged state can react with water and oxygen, resulting in capacity fading upon cycling. By eliminating oxygen, adjusting the pH values of the electrolyte and using carbon-coated electrode materials, LiTi2(PO4)3/Li2SO4/LiFePO4 aqueous lithium-ion batteries exhibited excellent stability with capacity retention over 90% after 1,000 cycles when being fully charged/discharged in 10 minutes and 85% after 50 cycles even at a very low current rate of 8 hours for a full charge/discharge offering an energy storage system with high safety, low cost, long cycling life and appropriate energy density. Aqueous lithium-ion batteries have great potential as stationary power sources, but they have had problems with poor stability. A significant improvement in their cycling stability has been achieved by eliminating oxygen, adjusting the electrolyte pH values, and using a carbon-coated electrode material.

Nucleophilic catalysis of acylhydrazone equilibration for protein-directed dynamic covalent chemistry

Dynamic covalent chemistry uses reversible chemical reactions to set up an equilibrating network of molecules at thermodynamic equilibrium, which can adjust its composition in response to any agent capable of altering the free energy of the system. When the target is a biological macromolecule, such as a protein, the process corresponds to the protein directing the synthesis of its own best ligand. Here, we demonstrate that reversible acylhydrazone formation is an effective chemistry for biological dynamic combinatorial library formation. In the presence of aniline as a nucleophilic catalyst, dynamic combinatorial libraries equilibrate rapidly at pH 6.2, are fully reversible, and may be switched on or off by means of a change in pH. We have interfaced these hydrazone dynamic combinatorial libraries with two isozymes from the glutathione S-transferase class of enzyme, and observed divergent amplification effects, where each protein selects the best-fitting hydrazone for the hydrophobic region of its active site. The composition of a dynamic combinatorial library can be altered by adding a target molecule that either stabilizes (or destabilizes) one or more of its members. The range of reversible chemical reactions compatible with biological targets such as proteins is somewhat limited, but now it has been shown that aniline-catalysed acylhydrazone formation is effective in this context.

Etching and narrowing of graphene from the edges

Large-scale graphene electronics requires lithographic patterning of narrow graphene nanoribbons for device integration. However, conventional lithography can only reliably pattern ~20-nm-wide GNR arrays limited by lithography resolution, while sub-5-nm GNRs are desirable for high on/off ratio field-effect transistors at room temperature. Here, we devised a gas phase chemical approach to etch graphene from the edges without damaging its basal plane. The reaction involved high temperature oxidation of graphene in a slightly reducing environment in the presence of ammonia to afford controlled etch rate (≲1&nbsp;nm&nbsp;min−1). We fabricated ~20–30-nm-wide graphene nanoribbon arrays lithographically, and used the gas phase etching chemistry to narrow the ribbons down to &lt;10&nbsp;nm. For the first time, a high on/off ratio up to ~104 was achieved at room temperature for field-effect transistors built with sub-5-nm-wide graphene nanoribbon semiconductors derived from lithographic patterning and narrowing. Our controlled etching method opens up a chemical way to control the size of various graphene nano-structures beyond the capability of top-down lithography. Usable electronic devices exploiting the attractive properties of graphene will require narrow ‘nanoribbons’ of the atom-thin carbon sheets. Ribbons narrower than 5&nbsp;nm are desirable for effective devices, but conventional lithography is limited to 20&nbsp;nm. Now, a gas-phase chemical approach for etching graphene from the edges has produced graphene nanoribbons below 5&nbsp;nm.

A delocalized arene-bridged diuranium single-molecule magnet

Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are compounds that, below a blocking temperature, exhibit stable magnetization purely of molecular origin, and not caused by long-range ordering of magnetic moments in the bulk. They thus show promise for applications such as data storage of ultra-high density. The stability of the magnetization increases with increasing ground-state spin and magnetic anisotropy. Transition-metal SMMs typically possess high-spin ground states, but insufficient magnetic anisotropies. Lanthanide SMMs exhibit large magnetic anisotropies, but building high-spin ground states is difficult because they tend to form ionic bonds that limit magnetic exchange coupling. In contrast, the significant covalent bonding and large spin–orbit contributions associated with uranium are particularly attractive for the development of improved SMMs. Here we report a delocalized arene-bridged diuranium SMM. This study demonstrates that arene-bridged polyuranium clusters can exhibit SMM behaviour without relying on the superexchange coupling of spins. This approach may lead to increased blocking temperatures. Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are multinuclear clusters whose behaviour typically relies on intramolecular spin-coupling interactions between neighbouring metal ions. A diuranium–arene complex has now been prepared that shows behaviour characteristic of an SMM without relying on this type of superexchange mechanism. This may enable the construction of SMMs that maintain their magnetism at higher temperatures.

A molybdenum complex bearing PNP-type pincer ligands leads to the catalytic reduction of dinitrogen into ammonia

The synthesis of transition metal–dinitrogen complexes and the stoichiometric transformation of their coordinated dinitrogen into ammonia and hydrazine have been the subject of considerable research, with a view to achieving nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions. Since a single example in 2003, no examples have been reported of the catalytic conversion of dinitrogen into ammonia under ambient conditions. The dimolybdenum–dinitrogen complex bearing PNP pincer ligands was found to work as an effective catalyst for the formation of ammonia from dinitrogen, with 23&nbsp;equiv. of ammonia being produced with the catalyst (12&nbsp;equiv. of ammonia are produced based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst). This is another successful example of the catalytic and direct conversion of dinitrogen into ammonia under ambient reaction conditions. We believe that the results described in this Article provide valuable information with which to develop a more effective nitrogen-fixation system under mild reaction conditions. Nitrogen fixing is an extremely energy-consuming industrial process so there is much effort underway to develop better catalytic methods. Now, a dimolybdenum–dinitrogen complex bearing a PNP pincer ligand has been found to work as an effective catalyst for the formation of ammonia from dinitrogen.

Synthesis of 3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate octasaccharides that inhibit the herpes simplex virus type 1 host–cell interaction

Cell surface carbohydrates play significant roles in a number of biologically important processes. Heparan sulfate, for instance, is a ubiquitously distributed polysulfated polysaccharide that is involved, among other things, in the initial step of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. The virus interacts with cell-surface heparan sulfate to facilitate host-cell attachment and entry. 3-O-Sulfonated heparan sulfate has been found to function as an HSV-1 entry receptor. Achieving a complete understanding of these interactions requires the chemical synthesis of such oligosaccharides, but this remains challenging. Here, we present a convenient approach for the synthesis of two irregular 3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate octasaccharides, making use of a key disaccharide intermediate to acquire different building blocks for the oligosaccharide chain assembly. Despite substantial structural differences, the prepared 3-O-sulfonated sugars blocked viral infection in a dosage-dependent manner with remarkable similarity to one another. Oligosaccharides displayed at cell surfaces have important biological functions — such as controlling the entry of viruses — but a full understanding of this behaviour requires the synthesis of such compounds, which remains challenging. Here, two synthetic octasaccharides were shown to have remarkably similar inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection of cell cultures to the natural oligosaccharide identified in enzymatic studies.

Recognition-mediated activation of therapeutic gold nanoparticles inside living cells

Supramolecular chemistry provides a versatile tool for the organization of molecular systems into functional structures and the actuation of these assemblies for applications through the reversible association between complementary components. Use of this methodology in living systems, however, represents a significant challenge owing to the chemical complexity of cellular environments and lack of selectivity of conventional supramolecular interactions. Herein, we present a host–guest system featuring diaminohexane-terminated gold nanoparticles (AuNP–NH2) and complementary cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]). In this system, threading of CB[7] on the particle surface reduces the cytotoxicity of AuNP–NH2 through sequestration of the particle in endosomes. Intracellular triggering of the therapeutic effect of AuNP–NH2 was then achieved through the administration of 1-adamantylamine (ADA), removing CB[7] from the nanoparticle surface, causing the endosomal release and concomitant in situ cytotoxicity of AuNP–NH2. This supramolecular strategy for intracellular activation provides a new tool for potential therapeutic applications. Application of supramolecular chemistry in living systems is challenging because of the inherent chemical complexity of cellular environments. Now, the use of a carefully designed host–guest system featuring diaminohexane-terminated gold nanoparticles and complementary cucurbit[7]uril macrocycles has been shown to provide triggered activation of a therapeutic system in living cells.

Palladium-mediated intracellular chemistry

Many important intracellular biochemical reactions are modulated by transition metals, typically in the form of metalloproteins. The ability to carry out selective transformations inside a cell would allow researchers to manipulate or interrogate innumerable biological processes. Here, we show that palladium nanoparticles trapped within polystyrene microspheres can enter cells and mediate a variety of Pd0-catalysed reactions, such as allylcarbamate cleavage and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling. The work provides the basis for the customization of heterogeneous unnatural catalysts as tools to carry out artificial chemistries within cells. Such in cellulo synthesis has potential for a plethora of applications ranging from cellular labelling to synthesis of modulators or inhibitors of cell function. Palladium nanoparticles trapped within polystyrene beads can enter cells and mediate a variety of Pd0-catalysed reactions, including allylcarbamate cleavage and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling. The methodology presented provides the basis for the customization of heterogeneous unnatural catalysts as tools for carrying out artificial chemistries within cells.

Highly dynamic motion of crown ethers along oligolysine peptide chains

Molecular mobility has attracted considerable attention in supramolecular chemistry and biochemistry, but the simple question of whether a small molecule can move directly between different binding sites of a multitopic host without intermediate dissociation has not been addressed so far. To study such processes, we consider hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments on a model system comprising complexes formed between 18-crown-6 and oligolysine peptides. Because direct binding-site hopping is indistinguishable in solution from a dissociation/reassociation mechanism, here we show that the high vacuum of a mass spectrometer offers a unique environment for probing such processes. The highly dynamic motion of crown ethers along oligolysine peptide chains proceeds mechanistically by a simultaneous transfer of the crown ether from its ammonium ion binding site to a nearby amino group together with a proton. Furthermore, the exchange experiments unambiguously reveal the zwitterionic structure of the 18-crown-6/oligolysine complexes, highlighting the versatility and potential of gas-phase experiments for investigating non-covalent interactions. H/D exchange reactions in the high vacuum of a mass spectrometer reveal how crown ethers move between ammonium ion binding sites of an oligolysine peptide. This study enables the dynamics of non-covalent interactions to be probed in a unique environment and could be applied to more complex artificial or natural systems.

Title: 
Compressed alkanes in reversible encapsulation complexes

Simple alkanes feature fully extended conformations as their lowest-energy shapes but can assume coiled, compressed conformations in small spaces. A series of normal alkanes, C16 to C19, were encapsulated in self-assembled, hydrogen-bonded complexes. Coiling of the longer alkanes was observed by NMR spectroscopy. The coiling exerts pressure on the interior; the hydrogen bonding seams are loosened, and rotation of the capsule's components occurs on the NMR timescale. The rotation results in interconversion of mirror-image capsule assemblies (racemization). The racemization rates were determined and shown to increase with the length of the alkane, the longer alkanes exerting more pressure. Free energies of activation for racemization were determined at the coalescence temperatures, and were ΔG‡&nbsp;=&nbsp;15.7, 16.7 and 17.2&nbsp;kcal&nbsp;mol−1 for C19, C18 and C17, respectively. The shorter C16 was encapsulated in its fully extended conformation, and does not seem to exert pressure inside the capsule. Molecules confined to small volumes can contort themselves into unusual conformations that differ from those usually observed when no constraints are placed on them. It is now shown that when normal alkanes are encapsulated inside self-assembled capsules, they adopt a coiled conformation and exert pressure inside their hosts.

Title: 
Template synthesis of precisely monodisperse silica nanoparticles within self-assembled organometallic spheres

One of the key challenges in materials science is to control the size and shape of inorganic nanoparticles with a high degree of precision, as these parameters have a significant influence on the nanoparticles' properties and potential applications. Here, we describe the preparation of highly monodisperse silica nanoparticles smaller than 5&nbsp;nm in diameter by using self-assembled, hollow, spherical compounds as ‘endo-templates’. These coordination complexes with pendant sugar groups lining their interiors—assembled from 12 metal ions and 24 bis-pyridyl ligands containing glucose substituents—acted as structurally well-defined templates for the sol–gel condensation of alkoxysilanes. The polydispersities of the silica nanoparticles made with this method approached unity, with Mw/Mn&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1.01. The component ligands are modified easily, which enables an accurate expansion of the coordination complex and the subsequent control of the monodisperse silica nanoparticles that span molecular weights of 5,000 to 31,000&nbsp;Da (corresponding to 2–4&nbsp;nm in diameter). This method could be applicable to the preparation of other inorganic nanoparticles. When making nanoparticles it is often desirable to produce samples in which there is little variation in the size of the structures that are formed. Hollow self-assembled metal–organic cages have now been shown to be effective templates for the preparation of monodisperse silica nanoparticles, and may also prove useful for the controlled synthesis of nanoparticles from other materials.

Coordination chemistry at carbon

Electron-rich allenes and heterocumulenes are commonly described by the regular notations of organic chemistry. Following on from published results and recent computational studies, we present here a host of crystallographic and reactivity data, as well as theoretical results, that indicate a highly non-canonical bonding situation in many members of this series. These must actually be interpreted as coordination compounds, in which carbon serves as a ‘central atom’ that interacts with its ‘ligand sphere’ via donor–acceptor bonds, even if these internal ligands themselves are carbon based. This captodative description is not limited to compounds that supposedly comprise a carbon(0) centre, a peculiar oxidation state that can be probed experimentally by geminal diauration. As the available data suggest that this unconventional interpretation of C–C and C–X bonds is more generally applicable than previously anticipated, it may well affect our understanding of organic chemistry in general. A systematic variation of ligand properties allows an in-depth experimental and theoretical study of a highly non-canonical bonding situation in certain organic compounds, and provides insight into the criteria that must be fulfilled for such compounds to be truly considered as carbon(0)-containing entities.

Title: 
Self-assembly and optically triggered disassembly of hierarchical dendron–virus complexes

Nature offers a vast array of biological building blocks that can be combined with synthetic materials to generate a variety of hierarchical architectures. Viruses are particularly interesting in this respect because of their structure and the possibility of them functioning as scaffolds for the preparation of new biohybrid materials. We report here that cowpea chlorotic mottle virus particles can be assembled into well-defined micrometre-sized objects and then reconverted into individual viruses by application of a short optical stimulus. Assembly is achieved using photosensitive dendrons that bind on the virus surface through multivalent interactions and then act as a molecular glue between the virus particles. Optical triggering induces the controlled decomposition and charge switching of dendrons, which results in the loss of multivalent interactions and the release of virus particles. We demonstrate that the method is not limited to the virus particles alone, but can also be applied to other functional protein cages such as magnetoferritin. Viruses are ideal templates for engineering multifunctional materials. They can exhibit multiple copies of surface ligands and encapsulate inorganic and organic materials. Here, viruses are assembled into well-defined micrometre-sized objects by the addition of dendritic linkers. The linkers are designed to decompose on irradiation, which results in the release of the original virus particles.

Title: 
Nitrenium ions as ligands for transition metals

Unlike N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which are now used ubiquitously in metal-based chemistry, the nitrogen-derived analogue (in which a carbon is replaced with the isoelectronic nitrogen cation, a nitrenium ion) has remained elusive as a ligand for metals. This is especially intriguing, because several other main-group analogues of NHCs have been prepared, and have been shown to coordinate with transition-metal complexes. Here, we describe the preparation of several N-heterocyclic nitrenium ions that are isoelectronic and isostructural to NHCs, and study their ligand properties. The formation of relatively strong nitrenium–metal bonds is unambiguously confirmed, in solution by selective 15N-labelling experiments, and in the solid state by X-ray crystallography. Experimental and computational studies of the electronic properties of this novel type of ligand suggest that they are poor σ-donors and good π-acceptors. Nitrenium salts have been known for more than 100 years. Despite being isoelectronic and isostructural to the ubiquitous N-heterocyclic carbene ligands and other main-group analogues, their coordination to metals has remained elusive. Here, the first examples of nitrenium ions as ligands for transition metals are described, along with investigations of their electronic properties.

Title: 
Kinetic resolution of constitutional isomers controlled by selective protection inside a supramolecular nanocapsule

The concept of self-assembling container molecules as yocto-litre reaction flasks is gaining prominence. However, the idea of using such containers as a means of protection is not well developed. Here, we illustrate this idea in the context of kinetic resolutions. Specifically, we report on the use of a water-soluble, deep-cavity cavitand to bring about kinetic resolutions within pairs of esters that otherwise cannot be resolved because they react at very similar rates. Resolution occurs because the presence of the cavitand leads to a competitive binding equilibrium in which the stronger binder primarily resides inside the host and the weaker binding ester primarily resides in the bulk hydrolytic medium. For the two families of ester examined, the observed kinetic resolutions were highest within the optimally fitting smaller esters. Kinetic resolution — which relies on the difference in reaction rates of isomers — is most often used in the context of separation of stereoisomers. Here, a self-assembling container molecule is used to protect certain guest molecules from the bulk reaction medium and effect a resolution of constitutional isomers.

Title: 
Directed long-range molecular migration energized by surface reaction

The recoil of adsorbates away (desorption) and towards (reaction) surfaces is well known. Here, we describe the long-range recoil of adsorbates in the plane of a surface, and accordingly the novel phenomenon of reactions occurring at a substantial distance from the originating event. Three thermal and three electron-induced surface reactions are shown by scanning tunnelling microscopy to propel their physisorbed ethylenic products across the rough surface of Si(100) over a distance of up to 200&nbsp;Å before an attachment reaction. The recoil energy in the ethylenic products comes from thermal exoergicity or from electronic excitation of chemisorbed alkenes. We propose that the mechanism of migration is a rolling motion, because the recoiling molecule overcomes raised surface obstacles. Electronic excitation of propene causes directional recoil and often end-to-end inversion, suggesting cartwheeling. Ab initio calculations of the halogenation and electron-induced reactions support a model in which asymmetric forces between the molecule and the surface induce rotation and therefore migration. The recoil of adsorbates away from and towards surfaces is well-known. Here, long-range recoil in the plane of the surface, which leads to reaction at a distance, is described. Surface reactions are shown to propel their physisorbed ethylenic products across the rough surface of Si(100) by up to 200&nbsp;Å before re-attachment.

Title: 
A facile route to ketene-functionalized polymers for general materials applications

Function matters in materials science, and methodologies that provide paths to multiple functionality in a single step are to be prized. Therefore, we introduce a robust and efficient strategy for exploiting the versatile reactivity of ketenes in polymer chemistry. New monomers for both radical and ring-opening metathesis polymerization have been developed, which take advantage of Meldrum's acid as both a synthetic building block and a thermolytic precursor to dialkyl ketenes. The ketene-functionalized polymers are directly detected by their characteristic infrared absorption and are found to be stable under ambient conditions. The inherent ability of ketenes to provide crosslinking via dimerization and to act as reactive chemical handles via addition, provides simple methodology for application in complex materials challenges. Such versatile characteristics are illustrated by covalently attaching and patterning a dye through microcontact printing. The strategy highlights the significant opportunities afforded by the traditionally neglected ketene functional group in polymer chemistry. The ability to rapidly functionalize polymers is vital for application development. Here, a method for the introduction of masked ketenes into monomers for both ring-opening metathesis and radical-type polymerizations is described. These ketenes — a group previously underexploited in polymer chemistry — allow both crosslinking and post-polymerization functionalization of the polymers.

Title: 
Anion order in perovskite oxynitrides

Transition-metal oxynitrides with perovskite-type structures are an emerging class of materials with optical, photocatalytic, dielectric and magnetoresistive properties that may be sensitive to oxide–nitride order, but the anion-ordering principles were unclear. Here we report an investigation of the representative compounds SrMO2N (M&nbsp;=&nbsp;Nb, Ta) using neutron and electron diffraction. This revealed a robust 1O/2(O0.5N0.5) partial anion order (up to at least 750&nbsp;°C in the apparently cubic high-temperature phases) that directs the rotations of MO4N2 octahedra in the room-temperature superstructure. The anion distribution is consistent with local cis-ordering of the two nitrides in each octahedron driven by covalency, which results in disordered zigzag M–N chains in planes within the perovskite lattice. Local structures for the full range of oxynitride perovskites are predicted and a future challenge is to tune properties by controlling the order and dimensionality of the anion chains and networks. Oxynitrides of transition metals are emerging materials with useful properties and improved stability over corresponding nitrides, but a full understanding of their anion ordering has been lacking. Now, a neutron and electron diffraction study of the perovskites SrNbO2N and SrTaO2N reveals the chemical principles for anion order and their potential influence on materials properties.

Reversible bond formation enables the replication and amplification of a crosslinking salen complex as an orthogonal base pair

The universal genetic code relies on two hydrogen-bonded Watson–Crick base pairs that can form 64 triplet codons. This places a limit on the number of amino acids that can be encoded, which has motivated efforts to create synthetic base pairs that are orthogonal to the natural ones. An additional base pair would result in another 61 triplet codons. Artificial organic base pairs have been described in enzymatic incorporation studies, and inorganic T–Hg–T and C–Ag–C base pairs have been reported to form in primer extension studies. Here, we demonstrate a metal base pair that is fully orthogonal and can be replicated, and can even be amplified by polymerase chain reaction in the presence of the canonical pairs dA:dT and dG:dC. Crystal structures of a dS–Cu–dS base pair inside a polymerase show that reversible chemistry is possible directly inside the polymerase, which enables the efficient copying of the inorganic crosslink. The results open up the possibility of replicating and amplifying artificial inorganic DNA nanostructures by extending the genetic alphabet. Adding one further base pair to the classic Watson–Crick scheme not only expands the genetic code but also offers opportunities to modify the structure and function of DNA. It has now been shown that an artificial metal–salen base pair can be enzymatically incorporated into DNA duplexes and even amplified by PCR.

Molecules containing rare-earth atoms solely bonded by transition metals

Although metal–metal bonding is important in the chemistry of both solid-state intermetallic compounds and molecular species, the study of this bonding is limited by the compounds available and it is rarely possible to identify connections between these two areas. In this study, molecular intermetalloids [Ln(ReCp2)3] (Ln&nbsp;=&nbsp;Sm, Lu and La) have been synthesized that contain lanthanoid metals bound only to transition metals. Although they are highly reactive species, such lanthanoid-core transition-metal-shell compounds can be stable in solution. They mimic the bonding situation of intermetallic compounds, as revealed by a direct comparison of molecular and solid state lanthanoid–transition metal bonding. Although intermetallic compounds and alloys feature metal atoms bonded solely to other metal atoms, this motif is unusual in molecular compounds. Now, three compounds with lanthanide metals surrounded by transition metal atoms have been made. Although reactive, they mimic intermetallic bonding and form a conceptual link from coordination compounds.

A bioinspired approach for controlling accessibility in calix[4]arene-bound metal cluster catalysts

In enzymes, the electronic and steric environments of active centres, and therefore their activity in biological processes, are controlled by the surrounding amino acids. In a similar manner, organic ligands have been used for the ‘passivation’ of metal clusters, that is, inhibition of their aggregation and control of their environment. However, the ability of enzymes to maintain large degrees of accessibility has remained difficult to mimic in synthetic systems in which little room, if any, is typically left to bind to other species. Here, using calix[4]arene macrocycles bearing phosphines as crude mimics of the rigid backbones of proteins, we demonstrate the synthesis of gold clusters and the control of their accessibility through an interplay between the sizes of the calixarene ligands and metal cores. For 0.9-nm cores, 25% of all the gold atoms within the cluster bind to the chemisorption probe 2-naphthalenethiol. This accessibility dramatically decreases with 1.1-nm and 4-nm gold cores. The accessibility of catalytically active sites in enzymes is maintained by the surrounding amino acid residues, but in synthetic metal clusters, these sites are typically blocked by the organic groups used to coat them. It has now been shown that the accessibility of gold clusters bound by calixarenes can be controlled by tuning the relative sizes of the metal cores and the ligands.

Direct transformation of graphene to fullerene

Although fullerenes can be efficiently generated from graphite in high yield, the route to the formation of these symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing carbon cages from a flat graphene sheet remains a mystery. The most widely accepted mechanisms postulate that the graphene structure dissociates to very small clusters of carbon atoms such as C2, which subsequently coalesce to form fullerene cages through a series of intermediates. In this Article, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy directly visualizes, in real time, a process of fullerene formation from a graphene sheet. Quantum chemical modelling explains four critical steps in a top-down mechanism of fullerene formation: (i) loss of carbon atoms at the edge of graphene, leading to (ii) the formation of pentagons, which (iii) triggers the curving of graphene into a bowl-shaped structure and which (iv) subsequently zips up its open edges to form a closed fullerene structure. Although fullerenes have been synthesized from graphite for a long time, the exact mechanism is relatively unknown. Now, in situ microscopy and quantum chemical modelling have directly followed the formation of fullerenes from a single graphitic sheet — graphene.

High-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells with ferrocene-based electrolytes

Dye-sensitized solar cells based on iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolytes are viable low-cost alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells. However, as well as providing record efficiencies of up to 12.0%, the use of I−/I3− in such solar cells also brings about certain limitations that stem from its corrosive nature and complex two-electron redox chemistry. Alternative redox mediators have been investigated, but these generally fall well short of matching the performance of conventional I−/I3− electrolytes. Here, we report energy conversion efficiencies of 7.5% (simulated sunlight, AM1.5, 1,000&nbsp;W&nbsp;m−2) for dye-sensitized solar cells combining the archetypal ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) single-electron redox couple with a novel metal-free organic donor–acceptor sensitizer (Carbz-PAHTDTT). These Fc/Fc+-based devices exceed the efficiency achieved for devices prepared using I−/I3− electrolytes under comparable conditions, revealing the great potential of ferrocene-based electrolytes in future dye-sensitized solar cells applications. This improvement results from a more favourable matching of the redox potential of the ferrocene couple with that of the new donor–acceptor sensitizer. Dye-sensitized solar cells combining electrolytes based on the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple with a metal-free organic donor–acceptor sensitizer are reported to achieve a record 7.5% energy conversion efficiency, revealing the great potential of ferrocene-based electrolytes for future dye-sensitized solar cell applications.

Sensing of proteins in human serum using conjugates of nanoparticles and green fluorescent protein

There is a direct correlation between protein levels and disease states in human serum, which makes it an attractive target for sensors and diagnostics. However, this is challenging because serum features more than 20,000 proteins, with an overall protein content greater than 1&nbsp;mM. Here we report a sensor based on a hybrid synthetic–biomolecule that uses arrays of green fluorescent protein and nanoparticles to detect proteins at biorelevant concentrations in both buffer and human serum. Distinct and reproducible fluorescence-response patterns were obtained from five serum proteins (human serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, transferrin, fibrinogen and α-antitrypsin), both in buffer and when spiked into human serum. Using linear discriminant analysis we identified these proteins with an identification accuracy of 100% in buffer and 97% in human serum. The arrays were also able to discriminate between different concentrations of the same protein, as well as a mixture of different proteins in human serum. Protein imbalances in serum can be correlated with disease, but measurement and subsequent diagnosis is made difficult by the complex composition of serum. Now an array-based sensor, containing synthetic gold nanoparticles and biocompatible green fluorescent protein, has been developed that can detect proteins in undiluted human serum at physiologically relevant concentrations.

Organic structure determination using atomic-resolution scanning probe microscopy

Nature offers a huge and only partially explored variety of small molecules with potential pharmaceutical applications. Commonly used characterization methods for natural products include spectroscopic techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. In some cases, however, these techniques do not succeed in the unambiguous determination of the chemical structure of unknown compounds. To validate the usefulness of scanning probe microscopy as an adjunct to the other tools available for organic structure analysis, we used the natural product cephalandole A, which had previously been misassigned, and later corrected. Our results, corroborated by density functional theory, demonstrate that direct imaging of an organic compound with atomic-resolution force microscopy facilitates the accurate determination of its chemical structure. We anticipate that our method may be developed further towards molecular imaging with chemical sensitivity, and will become generally useful in solving certain classes of natural product structures. The structure of many natural products can often only be confirmed by comparison with a synthetic sample. Here, scanning probe microscopy techniques allow the ultimate discrimination between structures suggested by the standard range of analytical techniques, proving the power of single-molecule imaging for molecular structure determination.

A ‘Texas-sized’ molecular box that forms an anion-induced supramolecular necklace

The ‘blue box’ (cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) or CBPQT4+), developed by Stoddart and colleagues, forms effective charge transfer complexes with a variety of electron-rich species and has been used to support the formation of a wide range of interlocked structures. However, little effort seems to have been devoted to generalizing the blue box concept. We describe a new flexible tetracationic macrocycle—a ‘Texas-sized’ molecular box. This positively charged receptor is capable of binding the mono-terephthalate anion, forming pseudorotaxanes. These pseudorotaxanes self-assemble into short supramolecular pseudo-oligorotaxanes in solution and more extended pseudo-polyrotaxanes in the solid state. The supramolecular oligomers formed in solution are environmentally responsive; they undergo deaggregation as the overall concentration of the cationic and anionic constituents is reduced, the temperature is increased, or the protonation state of the threading mono-terephthalate anion is changed. Macrocyles capable of hosting other molecules inside their hollow interiors have been used extensively to make threaded complexes and interlocked molecules. Now, a relatively large and flexible tetracationic macrocycle has been shown to bind anionic guests to form pseudorotaxanes that form extended structures in solution and the solid state.

Asymmetric total syntheses of (+)- and (−)-versicolamide B and biosynthetic implications

The Diels–Alder reaction is one of the most well-studied, synthetically useful organic transformations. Although it has been postulated that a significant number of naturally occurring substances arise by biosynthetic Diels–Alder reactions, rigorous confirmation of a mechanistically distinct natural Diels–Alderase enzyme remains elusive. Within this context, several related fungi within the Aspergillus genus produce a number of metabolites of opposite absolute configuration, including (+)- or (−)-versicolamide B. These alkaloids are hypothesized to arise via biosynthetic Diels–Alder reactions, implying that each Aspergillus species possesses enantiomerically distinct Diels–Alderases. In this paper, experimental validation of these biosynthetic proposals via deployment of the intramolecular hetero-Diels–Alder reaction as a key step in the asymmetric total syntheses of (+)- and (−)-versicolamide B is described. Laboratory validation of the proposed biosynthetic Diels–Alder construction, coupled with the secondary metabolite profile of the producing fungi, reveals that each Aspergillus species has evolved enantiomerically distinct indole oxidases, as well as enantiomerically distinct Diels–Alderases. Two closely related species of fungus each produce one enantiomer of the same natural product. The biomimetic synthesis of both enantiomers reported here supports the unusual conclusion that the two species have evolved to produce a pair of enantiomerically distinct enzymes.

Bimetallic Pd(III) complexes in palladium-catalysed carbon–heteroatom bond formation

Palladium is a common transition metal for catalysis, and the fundamental organometallic reactivity of palladium in its 0, I, II and IV oxidation states is well established. The potential role of Pd(III) in catalysis has not been investigated because organometallic reactions that involve Pd(III) have not been reported previously. In this article we present the formation of carbon–heteroatom bonds from discrete bimetallic Pd(III) complexes and show the synergistic involvement of two palladium atoms of the bimetallic core during both oxidation and reductive elimination. Our results challenge the currently accepted mechanism for oxidative palladium catalysis via Pd(II)–Pd(IV) redox cycles and implicate bimetallic palladium complexes in redox catalysis. The new mechanistic insight provides an opportunity to explore rationally the potential of bimetallic palladium catalysis for synthesis. Chemistry of palladium in the 0, I, II and IV oxidation states is well established. Here, concerted reductive elimination from bimetallic Pd(III)–Pd(III) complexes is observed for the first time in carbon–heteroatom bond-forming processes relevant to oxidative palladium catalysis.

Dynamic hook-and-eye nanoparticle sponges

Systems in which nanoscale components of different types can be captured and/or released from organic scaffolds provide a fertile basis for the construction of dynamic, exchangeable functional materials. In such heterogeneous systems, the components interact with one another by means of programmable, noncovalent bonding interactions. Herein, we describe polymers that capture and release functionalized nanoparticles selectively during redox-controlled aggregation and disaggregation, respectively. The interactions between the polymer and the NPs are mediated by the reversible formation of polypseudorotaxanes, and give rise to architectures ranging from short chains composed of few nanoparticles to extended networks of nanoparticles crosslinked by the polymer. In the latter case, the polymer/nanoparticle aggregates precipitate from solution such that the polymer acts as a selective ‘sponge’ for the capture/release of the nanoparticles of different types. An organic polymer scaffold has now been developed that can capture and release functionalized inorganic nanoparticles by the threading and de-threading of pseudorotaxane linkages. The capture–release cycles are reversible and programmable both chemically and electrochemically. In mixtures of different nanoparticles, the scaffold can capture one type selectively — thus acting as a selective nanoparticle ‘sponge’.

An efficient synthesis of loline alkaloids

Loline (1) is a small alkaloid that, in spite of its simple-looking structure, has posed surprising challenges to synthetic chemists. It has been known for more than a century and has been the subject of extensive biological investigations, but only two total syntheses have been achieved to date. Here, we report an asymmetric total synthesis of loline that, with less then ten steps, is remarkably short. Our synthesis incorporates a Sharpless epoxidation, a Grubbs olefin metathesis and an unprecedented transannular aminobromination, which converts an eight-membered cyclic carbamate into a bromopyrrolizidine. The synthesis is marked by a high degree of chemo- and stereoselectivity and gives access to several members of the loline alkaloid family. It delivers sufficient material to support a programme aimed at studying the complex interactions between plants, fungi, insects and bacteria brokered by loline alkaloids. Loline is a small alkaloid with a deceptively simple-looking structure. Here, a remarkably short synthesis is reported, the key step of which is a transannular aminobromination. The synthesis provides access to loline and to several other members of the loline family in sufficient yield to support a programme investigating the complex biological interactions of these compounds.

Highly efficient photocatalytic oxygenation reactions using water as an oxygen source

The effective utilization of solar energy requires photocatalytic reactions with high quantum efficiency. Water is the most abundant reactant that can be used as an oxygen source in efficient photocatalytic reactions, just as nature uses water in an oxygenic photosynthesis. We report that photocatalytic oxygenation of organic substrates such as sodium p-styrene sulfonate occurs with nearly 100% quantum efficiency using manganese(III) porphyrins as an oxygenation catalyst, [RuII(bpy)3]2+ (bpy&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,2′-bipyridine) as a photosensitized electron-transfer catalyst, [CoIII(NH3)5Cl]2+ as a low-cost and weak one-electron oxidant, and water as an oxygen source in a phosphate buffer solution (pH&nbsp;7.4). A high-valent manganese-oxo porphyrin is proposed as an active oxidant that effects the oxygenation reactions. Water is the most abundant oxygen source, and is used as such by nature in photosynthesis. Now, it has been shown that photocatalytic oxygenation of organic substrates proceeds efficiently with water as the oxygen source, a manganese(III) porphyrin oxygenation catalyst, and a ruthenium complex as a photocatalyst.

Electrochemistry through glass

In this Article we have used new approaches to investigate a well-known chemical process, the propagation of electrochemical signals through a thin glass membrane. This process, which has been extensively studied over the last century, is the basis of the response of a potentiometric glass pH sensor; however, no amperometric glass sensors have yet been reported because of its high ohmic resistance. Voltammetry at nanoelectrodes has revealed that water molecules can diffuse through nanometre-thick layers of dry glass and undergo oxidation/reduction at the buried platinum surface. After soaking for a few hours in an aqueous solution, voltammetric waves of other redox couples, such as Ru(NH3)63+/2+, could also be obtained at the glass-covered platinum nanoelectrodes. This behaviour suggests that the nanometre-thick insulating glass sheath surrounding the platinum core can be largely converted to hydrated gel, and electrochemical processes occur at the platinum/hydrogel interface. Potential applications range from use in nanometre-sized solid-state pH probes and determination of the water content in organic solvents to glass-modified voltammetric sensors and electrocatalysts. Glass is widely used as an electrical insulator in electrodes, but in spite of its high resistance, 100-nm-thick layers of glass have now been shown to be sufficiently conductive for electrochemical measurements. Obtaining redox couples through glass-covered nanoelectrodes suggests that the pH response of the glass is due to the formation of a hydrogel layer in acidic solution.

Sequence-selective assembly of tweezer molecules on linear templates enables frameshift-reading of sequence information

Information storage and processing is carried out at the level of individual macromolecules in biological systems, but there is no reason, in principle, why synthetic copolymers should not be used for the same purpose. Previous work has suggested that monomer sequence information in chain-folding synthetic copolyimides can be recognized by tweezer-type molecules binding to adjacent triplet sequences, and we show here that different tweezer molecules can show different sequence selectivities. This work, based on 1H NMR spectroscopy in solution and on single-crystal X-ray analysis of tweezer–oligomer complexes in the solid state, provides the first clear-cut demonstration of polyimide chain-folding and adjacent-tweezer binding. It also reveals a new and entirely unexpected mechanism for sequence recognition, which, by analogy with a related process in biomolecular information processing, may be termed ‘frameshift-reading’. The ability of one particular tweezer molecule to detect, with exceptionally high sensitivity, long-range sequence information in chain-folding aromatic copolyimides is readily explained by this novel process. Monomer-sequence information in synthetic copolyimides can be recognized by tweezer-type molecules binding to adjacent triplet-sequences through complementary aromatic π–π-stacking, with different tweezer molecules showing different sequence-selectivities. Single-crystal X-ray analysis of tweezer–oligomer complexes confirms the tweezer-binding selectivity, and NMR spectroscopy reveals a new mechanism (‘frameshift-reading’) for tweezer-based sequence recognition in chain-folding copolyimides.

Multi-hierarchical self-assembly of a collagen mimetic peptide from triple helix to nanofibre and hydrogel

Replicating the multi-hierarchical self-assembly of collagen has long-attracted scientists, from both the perspective of the fundamental science of supramolecular chemistry and that of potential biomedical applications in tissue engineering. Many approaches to drive the self-assembly of synthetic systems through the same steps as those of natural collagen (peptide chain to triple helix to nanofibres and, finally, to a hydrogel) are partially successful, but none simultaneously demonstrate all the levels of structural assembly. Here we describe a peptide that replicates the self-assembly of collagen through each of these steps. The peptide features collagen's characteristic proline–hydroxyproline–glycine repeating unit, complemented by designed salt-bridged hydrogen bonds between lysine and aspartate to stabilize the triple helix in a sticky-ended assembly. This assembly is propagated into nanofibres with characteristic triple helical packing and lengths with a lower bound of several hundred nanometres. These nanofibres form a hydrogel that is degraded by collagenase at a similar rate to that of natural collagen. A short, synthetic peptide has been prepared that mimics much of the assembly process of natural collagen. Electrostatic interactions are used to create a sticky-ended structure, which in turn self-assembles through several levels of structural hierarchy from peptide to triple helix to nanofibre and finally to hydrogel.

Title: 
A palladium-catalysed enolate alkylation cascade for the formation of adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereocentres

The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of densely functionalized organic molecules that contain all-carbon quaternary stereocentres is a challenge to modern chemical methodology. The catalytically controlled, asymmetric α-alkylation of ketones represents another difficult task and is of major interest to our and other research groups. We report here a palladium-catalysed enantioselective process that addresses both problems simultaneously and allows the installation of vicinal all-carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocentres at the α-carbon of a ketone in a single step. This multiple bond-forming process is carried out on readily available β-ketoester starting materials and proceeds by conjugate addition of a palladium enolate, generated in situ, to activated Michael acceptors. As a result, the CO2 moiety of the substrate is displaced by a C–C fragment in an asymmetric cut-and-paste reaction with high yield, diastereomeric ratio and enantiomeric excess. The selective construction of multiple adjacent stereocentres is an important challenge for synthetic organic methodology, and only a handful of catalytic methods exist that can forge adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereocentres. Here, a palladium-catalysed multiple-bond-forming cascade leads to the construction of such systems in high yield, diastereomeric ratio and enantiomeric excess.

Title: 
Spatial and temporal control of the alkyne–azide cycloaddition by photoinitiated Cu(II) reduction

The click reaction paradigm is focused on the development and implementation of reactions that are simple to perform while being robust and providing exquisite control of the reaction and its products. Arguably the most prolific and powerful of these reactions, the copper-catalysed alkyne–azide reaction (CuAAC) is highly efficient and ubiquitous in an ever increasing number of synthetic methodologies and applications, including bioconjugation, labelling, surface functionalization, dendrimer synthesis, polymer synthesis and polymer modification. Unfortunately, as the Cu(I) catalyst is typically generated by the chemical reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), or added as a Cu(I) salt, temporal and spatial control of the CuAAC reaction is not readily achieved. Here, we demonstrate catalysis of the CuAAC reaction via the photochemical reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), affording comprehensive spatial and temporal control of the CuAAC reaction using standard photolithographic techniques. Results reveal the diverse capability of this technique in small molecule synthesis, patterned material fabrication and patterned chemical modification. The copper(I)-catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition is arguably the most prolific and powerful example of the click reaction paradigm. Here, photochemical reduction of Cu(II) allows spatial and temporal control over the reaction for small-molecule synthesis, patterning of hydrogel formation and the in situ labelling of gels, with features as small as 25 micrometres being produced.

Title: 
An efficient organocatalytic method for constructing biaryls through aromatic C–H activation

The direct functionalization of C–H bonds has drawn the attention of chemists for almost a century. C–H activation has mainly been achieved through four metal-mediated pathways: oxidative addition, electrophilic substitution, σ-bond metathesis and metal-associated carbene/nitrene/oxo insertion. However, the identification of methods that do not require transition-metal catalysts is important because methods involving such catalysts are often expensive. Another advantage would be that the requirement to remove metallic impurities from products could be avoided, an important issue in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Here, we describe the identification of a cross-coupling between aryl iodides/bromides and the C–H bonds of arenes that is mediated solely by the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline as catalyst in the presence of KOt-Bu as a base. This apparently transition-metal-free process provides a new strategy with which to achieve direct C–H functionalization. C–H activation has usually been achieved by transition metal-mediated pathways. Here, a cross-coupling between aryl halides and common arenes mediated by 1,10-phenanthroline as catalyst, in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide as base is described. Such reactions open a new window for achieving C–H activation without the need for transition metal catalysts.

Title: 
Regio- and stereodivergent antibiotic oxidative carbocyclizations catalysed by Rieske oxygenase-like enzymes

Oxidative cyclizations, exemplified by the biosynthetic assembly of the penicillin nucleus from a tripeptide precursor, are arguably the most synthetically powerful implementation of C–H activation reactions in nature. Here, we show that Rieske oxygenase-like enzymes mediate regio- and stereodivergent oxidative cyclizations to form 10- and 12-membered carbocyclic rings in the key steps of the biosynthesis of the antibiotics streptorubin B and metacycloprodigiosin, respectively. These reactions represent the first examples of oxidative carbocyclizations catalysed by non-haem iron-dependent oxidases and define a novel type of catalytic activity for Rieske enzymes. A better understanding of how these enzymes achieve such remarkable regio- and stereocontrol in the functionalization of unactivated hydrocarbon chains will greatly facilitate the development of selective man-made C–H activation catalysts. Enzyme-mediated oxidative cyclizations in nature are a powerful demonstration of the utility of selective C–H activation. Here, Rieske oxygenase-like enzymes RedG and McpG are shown to mediate regio- and stereodivergent carbocyclization of undecylprodigiosin to streptorubin B and metacycloprodigiosin, respectively. Understanding these remarkably selective C–H activations could inspire the design of biomimetic catalysts with similar capabilities.

Title: 
The rational design of nitric oxide selectivity in single-walled carbon nanotube near-infrared fluorescence sensors for biological detection

A major challenge in the synthesis of nanotube or nanowire sensors is to impart selective analyte binding through means other than covalent linkages, which compromise electronic and optical properties. We synthesized a 3,4-diaminophenyl-functionalized dextran (DAP-dex) wrapping for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) that imparts rapid and selective fluorescence detection of nitric oxide (NO), a messenger for biological signalling. The near-infrared (nIR) fluorescence of SWNTDAP-dex is immediately and directly bleached by NO, but not by other reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. This bleaching is reversible and shown to be caused by electron transfer from the top of the valence band of the SWNT to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of NO. The resulting optical sensor is capable of real-time and spatially resolved detection of NO produced by stimulating NO synthase in macrophage cells. We also demonstrate the potential of the optical sensor for in vivo detection of NO in a mouse model. Single-walled carbon nanotubes wrapped with a carbohydrate-based polymer bearing diaminophenyl groups can be used to detect nitric oxide (NO) — an important messenger molecule for biological signalling. These polymer–nanotube hybrids are capable of real-time and spatially resolved sensing of NO in living cells, and could ultimately prove useful for in vivo detection.

Imaging intracellular viscosity of a single cell during photoinduced cell death

Diffusion-mediated cellular processes, such as metabolism, signalling and transport, depend on the hydrodynamic properties of the intracellular matrix. Photodynamic therapy, used in the treatment of cancer, relies on the generation of short-lived cytotoxic agents within a cell on irradiation of a drug. The efficacy of this treatment depends on the viscosity of the medium through which the cytotoxic agent must diffuse. Here, spectrally resolved fluorescence measurements of a porphyrin-dimer-based molecular rotor are used to quantify intracellular viscosity changes in single cells. We show that there is a dramatic increase in the viscosity of the immediate environment of the rotor on photoinduced cell death. The effect of this viscosity increase is observed directly in the diffusion-dependent kinetics of the photosensitized formation and decay of a key cytotoxic agent, singlet molecular oxygen. Using these tools, we provide insight into the dynamics of diffusion in cells, which is pertinent to drug delivery, cell signalling and intracellular mass transport. The spectrally resolved fluorescence of a zinc–porphyrin dimer is used to quantify intracellular viscosity. The porphyrin dimer also acts as a singlet-oxygen sensitizer, and enables real-time observation of a surprisingly large increase in intracellular viscosity that occurs on singlet-oxygen-mediated photoinduced cell death.

Title: 
Synthesis of a stable adduct of dialane(4) (Al2H4) via hydrogenation of a magnesium(I) dimer

The desorption of dihydrogen from magnesium(II) hydride, MgH2 (containing 7.6&nbsp;wt% H), is reversible. MgH2 therefore holds promise as a hydrogen storage material in devices powered by fuel cells. We believed that dimeric magnesium(I) dimers (LMgMgL, L&nbsp;=&nbsp;β-diketiminate) could find use as soluble models to aid the study of the mechanisms and/or kinetics of the hydrogenation of magnesium and its alloys. Here, we show that LMgMgL can be readily hydrogenated to yield LMg(µ-H)2MgL by treatment with aluminium(III) hydride complexes. In one case, hydrogenation was reversed by treating LMg(µ-H)2MgL with potassium metal. The hydrogenation by-products are the first thermally stable, neutral aluminium(II) hydride complexes to be produced, one of which, [{(IPr)(H)2Al}2] (IPr&nbsp;=&nbsp;:C[{(C6H3-i-Pr2-2,6)NCH}2]), is an N-heterocyclic carbene adduct of the elusive parent dialane(4) (Al2H4). A computational analysis of this compound is presented. Magnesium hydride is a potential hydrogen-storage material, but its use is hampered by its high stability and slow hydrogen sorption processes. Dimeric magnesium compounds can act as models for these materials, and it is now shown that they can be easily and reversibly hydrogenated across the magnesium–magnesium bond.

Mechanistic insights into the ruthenium-catalysed diene ring-closing metathesis reaction

Ruthenium-catalysed ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is a powerful technique for the preparation of medium-to-large rings in organic synthesis, but the details of the intimate mechanism are obscure. The dynamic behaviour of an RCM-relevant ruthenacyclobutane complex and its reactivity with ethene were studied using low-temperature NMR spectroscopy to illuminate the mechanism of this widely used reaction. These kinetic and thermodynamic experiments allowed for mapping the energy surface of the key steps in the RCM reaction as mediated by Grubbs-type catalysts for alkene metathesis. The highest barrier along the RCM path is only 65&nbsp;kJ&nbsp;mol−1, which shows that this catalyst has extremely high inherent activity. Furthermore, this transition state corresponds to that connecting the intermediates in this reaction leading to ring opening of the cyclopentene product. This shows that ring closing is kinetically slightly favoured over ring opening, in addition to being driven by the loss of ethene. A kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the ruthenium-catalysed ring-closing metathesis reaction has been achieved through the study of key intermediates accessible, for the first time, from 14-electron phosphonium alkylidene catalyst precursors. High intrinsic activities and a thermodynamic preference for ring-closing versus ring-opening reactions is observed.

Specific fluorogenic probes for ozone in biological and atmospheric samples

Ozone exposure is a growing global health problem, especially in urban areas. While ozone in the stratosphere protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet light, tropospheric or ground-level ozone is toxic and can damage the respiratory tract. It has recently been shown that ozone may be produced endogenously in inflammation and antibacterial responses of the immune system; however, these results have sparked controversy owing to the use of a non-specific colorimetric probe. Here we report the synthesis of fluorescent molecular probes able to unambiguously detect ozone in both biological and atmospheric samples. Unlike other ozone-detection methods, in which interference from different reactive oxygen species is often a problem, these probes are ozone specific. Such probes will prove useful for the study of ozone in environmental science and biology, and so possibly provide some insight into the role of ozone in cells. In addition to environmental concerns about ozone, there is some debate regarding its role in biological systems. Researchers have now developed a fluorescent molecular probe that can selectively detect ozone — in preference to other reactive oxygen species — in both atmospheric and biological samples.

Title: 
Million-fold activation of the [Fe2(µ-O)2] diamond core for C–H bond cleavage

In biological systems, the cleavage of strong C–H bonds is often carried out by iron centres—such as that of methane monooxygenase in methane hydroxylation—through dioxygen activation mechanisms. High valent species with [Fe2(µ-O)2] diamond cores are thought to act as the oxidizing moieties, but the synthesis of complexes that cleave strong C–H bonds efficiently has remained a challenge. We report here the conversion of a synthetic complex with a valence-delocalized [Fe3.5(µ-O)2Fe3.5]3+ diamond core (1) into a complex with a valence-localized [HO–FeIII–O–FeIV=O]2+ open core (4), which cleaves C–H bonds over a million-fold faster. This activity enhancement results from three factors: the formation of a terminal oxoiron(iv) moiety, the conversion of the low-spin (S&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) FeIV=O centre to a high-spin (S&nbsp;=&nbsp;2) centre, and the concentration of the oxidizing capability to the active terminal oxoiron(iv) moiety. This suggests that similar isomerization strategies might be used by nonhaem diiron enzymes. Although enzymes are known to use diiron centres to cleave carbon–hydrogen bonds, preparing synthetic compounds that can break these strong, stable bonds has remained notoriously difficult. Now, converting a low-spin ‘diamond core’ iron–oxo biomimetic complex into its high-spin ‘open core’ counterpart has enhanced its C–H bond cleavage ability by over a million times.

Watching conformational- and photodynamics of single fluorescent proteins in solution

Observing the dynamics of single biomolecules over prolonged time periods is difficult to achieve without significantly altering the molecule through immobilization. It can, however, be accomplished using the anti-Brownian electrokinetic trap, which allows extended investigation of solution-phase biomolecules—without immobilization—through real-time electrokinetic feedback. Here we apply the trap to study an important photosynthetic antenna protein, allophycocyanin. The technique allows the observation of single molecules of solution-phase allophycocyanin for more than one second. We observe a complex relationship between fluorescence intensity and lifetime that cannot be explained by simple static kinetic models. Light-induced conformational changes are shown to occur and evidence is obtained for fluctuations in the spontaneous emission lifetime, which is typically assumed to be constant. Our methods provide a new window into the dynamics of fluorescent proteins and the observations are relevant for the interpretation of in&nbsp;vivo single-molecule imaging experiments, bacterial photosynthetic regulation and biomaterials for solar energy harvesting. A method for observing the photodynamics of single molecules, without having to immobilize them to a surface or confine them within vesicles, has been used to study the important photosynthetic antenna protein, allophycocyanin. Light-induced conformational changes and a complex relationship between fluorescence intensity and lifetime have been observed.

Cooperative molecular dynamics in surface reactions

The controlled imprinting of surfaces with specified patterns is important in the development of nanoscale devices. Previously, such patterns were created using self-assembled physisorbed adsorbate molecules that can be stabilized on the surface by subsequent chemical bonding. Here we show a first step towards use of the bonding within a surface to propagate reactions for patterning, namely the cooperative reaction of adjacent silicon atoms. We exploit the double-bonded silicon dimer pairs present on the surface of Si(100)-2×1 and show that the halogenation of one silicon atom (induced by electrons or heat) results in cooperative halogenation of the neighbouring silicon atom with unit efficiency. The reactants used were two 1-halopentane molecules physisorbed over a pair of silicon atoms. This cooperative pair of halogenation reactions was shown by ab initio calculation to be sequential on a timescale of femtoseconds. A cooperative reaction is reported whereby the halogenation of one silicon atom on a surface is shown to induce, invariably, halogenation of a neighbouring silicon. This is a first step towards using surface-propagated cooperative reactions to create molecular-scale patterns on surfaces.

An ionothermally prepared S = 1/2 vanadium oxyfluoride kagome lattice

Frustrated magnetic lattices offer the possibility of many exotic ground states that are of great fundamental importance. Of particular significance is the hunt for frustrated spin-1/2 networks as candidates for quantum spin liquids, which would have exciting and unusual magnetic properties at low temperatures. The few reported candidate materials have all been based on d9 ions. Here, we report the ionothermal synthesis of [NH4]2[C7H14N][V7O6F18], an inorganic–organic hybrid solid that contains a S&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/2 kagome network of d1 V4+ ions. The compound exhibits a high degree of magnetic frustration, with significant antiferromagnetic interactions but no long-range magnetic order or spin-freezing above 2&nbsp;K, and appears to be an excellent candidate for realizing a quantum spin liquid ground state in a spin-1/2 kagome network. Candidates for 'quantum spin liquid' materials are rare and often composed of two-dimensional kagome arrays of d9 centres. Analogous systems based on d1 metal ions may confer different properties, but there are no previously known examples. An inorganic–organic hybrid vanadium d1 material has now been prepared that seems to be an excellent candidate for a spin-liquid ground state.

A layered ionic crystal of polar Li@C60 superatoms

If the physical properties of C60 fullerene molecules can be controlled in C60 products already in use in various applications, the potential for industrial development will be significant. Encapsulation of a metal atom in the C60 fullerene molecule is a promising way to control its physical properties. However, the isolation of C60-based metallofullerenes has been difficult due to their insolubility. Here, we report the complete isolation and determination of the molecular and crystal structure of polar cationic Li@C60 metallofullerene. The physical and chemical properties of Li@C60 cation are compared with those of pristine C60. It is found that the lithium cation is located at off-centre positions in the C60–Ih cage interior and that the [Li+@C60] salt has a unique two-dimensional structure. The present method of purification and crystallization of C60-based metallofullerenes provides a new C60 fullerene material that contains a metal atom. Metal-containing fullerene cages are widely known, but hard to characterize because of their reactivity towards empty cages. Now the molecular and crystal structures of lithium-containing C60 molecules have been determined.

Mineralization of the metre-long biosilica structures of glass sponges is templated on hydroxylated collagen

The minerals involved in the formation of metazoan skeletons principally comprise glassy silica, calcium phosphate or carbonate. Because of their ancient heritage, glass sponges (Hexactinellida) may shed light on fundamental questions such as molecular evolution, the unique chemistry and formation of the first skeletal silica-based structures, and the origin of multicellular animals. We have studied anchoring spicules from the metre-long stalk of the glass rope sponge (Hyalonema sieboldi; Porifera, Class Hexactinellida), which are remarkable for their size, durability, flexibility and optical properties. Using slow-alkali etching of biosilica, we isolated the organic fraction, which was revealed to be dominated by a hydroxylated fibrillar collagen that contains an unusual [Gly–3Hyp–4Hyp] motif. We speculate that this motif is predisposed for silica precipitation, and provides a novel template for biosilicification in nature. Understanding how biosilica forms is crucial to our knowledge of this important biomaterial. Now, the role of collagen as structuring agent for the metre-long spicules of a primitive glass sponge has been revealed and found to have an unusual peptide motif.

Nanocrystal bilayer for tandem catalysis

Supported catalysts are widely used in industry and can be optimized by tuning the composition and interface of the metal nanoparticles and oxide supports. Rational design of metal–metal oxide interfaces in nanostructured catalysts is critical to achieve better reaction activities and selectivities. We introduce here a new class of nanocrystal tandem catalysts that have multiple metal–metal oxide interfaces for the catalysis of sequential reactions. We utilized a nanocrystal bilayer structure formed by assembling platinum and cerium oxide nanocube monolayers of less than 10&nbsp;nm on a silica substrate. The two distinct metal–metal oxide interfaces, CeO2–Pt and Pt–SiO2, can be used to catalyse two distinct sequential reactions. The CeO2–Pt interface catalysed methanol decomposition to produce CO and H2, which were subsequently used for ethylene hydroformylation catalysed by the nearby Pt–SiO2 interface. Consequently, propanal was produced selectively from methanol and ethylene on the nanocrystal bilayer tandem catalyst. This new concept of nanocrystal tandem catalysis represents a powerful approach towards designing high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts. The development of high-performance ‘smart’ catalysts will rely on the rational design of nanoscale metal–metal oxide interfaces. A tandem catalyst that has both CeO2-Pt and Pt-SiO2 interfaces is now reported, and is capable of catalysing sequential reactions to convert methanol into ethylene.

DNA charge transport over 34 nm

Molecular wires show promise in nanoscale electronics, but the synthesis of uniform, long conductive molecules is a significant challenge. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of precise length, by contrast, is synthesized easily, but its conductivity over the distances required for nanoscale devices has not been explored. Here we demonstrate DNA charge transport (CT) over 34&nbsp;nm in 100-mer monolayers on gold. Multiplexed gold electrodes modified with 100-mer DNA yield sizable electrochemical signals from a distal, covalent Nile Blue redox probe. Significant signal attenuation upon incorporation of a single base-pair mismatch demonstrates that CT is DNA-mediated. Efficient cleavage of these 100-mers by a restriction enzyme indicates that the DNA adopts a native conformation accessible to protein binding. Similar electron-transfer rates measured through 100-mer and 17-mer monolayers are consistent with rate-limiting electron tunnelling through the saturated carbon linker. This DNA-mediated CT distance of 34&nbsp;nm surpasses that of most reports of molecular wires. The potential for using molecules as wires in nanoscale electronics is somewhat tempered by the challenges in making long and uniform structures. Now, it has been shown that DNA — which is easily synthesized to precise lengths — can conduct charge over 34&nbsp;nm on multiplexed gold electrodes, a distance that surpasses most reports of molecular wires.

Gateway synthesis of daphnane congeners and their protein kinase C affinities and cell-growth activities

The daphnane diterpene orthoesters constitute a structurally fascinating family of natural products that exhibit a remarkable range of potent biological activities. Although partial activity information is available for some natural daphnanes, little information exists for non-natural congeners or on how changes in structure affect mode of action, function, potency or selectivity. A gateway strategy designed to provide general synthetic access to natural and non-natural daphnanes is described and utilized in the synthesis of two novel members of this class. In this study, a commercially available tartrate derivative was elaborated through a key late-stage diversification intermediate into B-ring yuanhuapin analogues to initiate exploration of the structure–function relationships of this class. Protein kinase C was identified as a cellular target for these agents, and their activity against human lung and leukaemia cell lines was evaluated. The natural product and a novel non-natural analogue exhibited significant potency, but the epimeric epoxide was essentially inactive. The daphnane diterpene orthoesters constitute a structurally fascinating family of natural products that exhibit remarkable and potent biological activities. A gateway strategy designed to provide general synthetic access to and biological evaluation of natural and non-natural daphnanes is described and used for yuanhuapin analogues.

Cation-induced kinetic trapping and enhanced hydrogen adsorption in a modulated anionic metal–organic framework

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)—microporous materials constructed by bridging metal centres with organic ligands—show promise for applications in hydrogen storage, which is a key challenge in the development of the ‘hydrogen economy’. Their adsorption capacities, however, have remained insufficient for practical applications, and thus strategies to enhance hydrogen–MOF interactions are required. Here we describe an anionic MOF material built from In(iii) centres and tetracarboxylic acid ligands (H4L) in which kinetic trapping behaviour—where hydrogen is adsorbed at high pressures but not released immediately on lowering the pressure—is modulated by guest cations. With piperazinium dications in its pores, the framework exhibits hysteretic hydrogen adsorption. On exchange of these dications with lithium cations, no hysteresis is seen, but instead there is an enhanced adsorption capacity coupled to an increase in the isosteric heat of adsorption. This is rationalized by the different locations of the cations within the pores, determined with precision by X-ray crystallography. Porous metal–organic frameworks are promising for hydrogen storage applications, but adsorption capacities have remained too low for practical use. Now, the adsorption behaviour of such a framework has been modulated by exchanging cations within its pores resulting in either kinetic trapping or enhanced hydrogen affinity.

N-silyl oxyketene imines are underused yet highly versatile reagents for catalytic asymmetric synthesis

The reactions of acyl anion equivalents (d1 synthons) with carbonyl electrophiles allow for the construction of a wide range of molecules useful for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, natural products and chiral ligands. Despite their utility, significant challenges still exist for developing catalytic, enantioselective variants of these reactions. For example, the asymmetric benzoin process, arguably the most characteristic reaction of d1 synthetic equivalents, finds no general solution for reactions involving aliphatic acyl anions. In this Article, we introduce a new class of stable, isolable silyl ketene imines derived from protected cyanohydrins. These nucleophiles serve as acyl anion equivalents in Lewis base catalysed aldol addition reactions and allow for the preparation of cross-benzoin and glycolate-aldol products in high yield and with exceptional diastereo- and enantioselectivities. A new class of stable, isolable N-silyl oxyketene imines derived from protected cyanohydrins is introduced. Utilization of these nucleophiles in Lewis-base-catalysed aldol additions allows access to either cross-benzoin or glycolate aldol-type products in good yields and exceptional selectivities by simply altering the conditions of the reaction.

Stellated polyhedral assembly of a topologically complicated Pd4L4 ‘Solomon cube’

Metallosupramolecular chemistry relies on self-assembly processes in which complicated species form through labile dative-covalent interactions. Two remarkable areas of this chemistry are the synthesis of topologically complicated threaded assemblies and of three-dimensional (3D) polyhedral assemblies. Very few polyhedral 3D metallosupramolecular assemblies show threaded motifs within them. Here we report an example of a new type of threaded 3D metallosupramolecular assembly built from four organic ligands and four palladium ions, a Pd4L4 so-called ‘Solomon's cube’ in which interweaving and twisting of the ligands form both Solomon's links and figure-of-eight ring motifs. In the solid state, six of these Pd4L4 tetramers assemble into a hollow spheroid that closely resembles a stellated truncated hexahedron. A topologically non-trivial metallosupramolecular structure is formed by a Pd4L4 complex in which interweaving and twisting of the ligands results in both Solomon's Link and figure-of-eight ring motifs. In the solid state, six of these complexes assemble into a hollow spheroid that closely resembles a stellated truncated hexahedron.

Polymer nanofibre junctions of attolitre volume serve as zeptomole-scale chemical reactors

Methods allowing chemical reactions to be carried out on ultra-small scales in a controllable fashion are potentially important for a number of disciplines, including molecular electronics, photonics and molecular biology, and may provide fundamental insight into chemistry in confined spaces. Ultra-small-scale reactions also circumvent potential problems associated with reagent and product toxicity, and reduce energy consumption and waste generation. Here, we report a technique for performing chemical reactions on a zeptomole (10−21&nbsp;mol) scale. We show that electrospun polymer nanofibres with a diameter of 100–300&nbsp;nm can be loaded with reactants, and that the junctions formed between crossed nanofibres can function as attolitre-volume reactors. Exposure to heat or solvent vapours fuses the fibres and initiates the reaction. The reaction products can be analysed directly within the nanofibre junctions by fluorescence measurements and mass spectrometry, and solvent extraction of multiple reactors allows product identification by common micromethods such as high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Performing chemical reactions on ultra-small scales is important in a number of disciplines. Now, it has been shown that a junction formed by fusing two polymer nanowires preloaded with reactants provides an effective attolitre-volume in which reactions can be conducted on a zeptomole (10−21&nbsp;mol) scale.

High-spin ground states via electron delocalization in mixed-valence imidazolate-bridged divanadium complexes

The field of molecular magnetism has grown tremendously since the discovery of single-molecule magnets, but it remains centred around the superexchange mechanism. The possibility of instead using a double-exchange mechanism (based on electron delocalization rather than Heisenberg exchange through a non-magnetic bridge) presents a tantalizing prospect for synthesizing molecules with high-spin ground states that are well isolated in energy. We now demonstrate that magnetic double exchange can be sustained by simple imidazolate bridging ligands, known to be well suited for the construction of coordination clusters and solids. A series of mixed-valence molecules of the type [(PY5Me2)VII(µ-Lbr) VIII(PY5Me2)]4+ were synthesized and their electron delocalization probed through cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemistry. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal a well-isolated S&nbsp;=&nbsp;5/2 ground state arising from double exchange for [(PY5Me2)2V2(µ-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolate)]4+. Combined modelling of the magnetic data and spectral analysis leads to an estimate of the double-exchange parameter of B&nbsp;=&nbsp;220&nbsp;cm−1 when vibronic coupling is taken into account. Single-molecule magnets are clusters of metal ions linked together by organic bridges, with properties typically arising from exchange coupling of unpaired metal electrons. In mixed-valence systems, another magnetic mechanism involving itinerant electrons can also occur and induce a high-spin ground state. Now, such electron delocalization has been observed through an imidazolate bridge — a common linker in metal-organic architectures — which may enable the construction of higher spin clusters or three-dimensional magnets.

A concentric planar doubly π-aromatic B19− cluster

Atomic clusters often show unique, size-dependent properties and have become a fertile ground for the discovery of novel molecular structures and chemical bonding. Here we report an investigation of the B19− cluster, which shows chemical bonding reminiscent of that in [10]annulene (C10H10) and [6]circulene (C24H12). Photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a relatively simple spectrum for B19−, with a high electron-binding energy. Theoretical calculations show that the global minimum of B19− is a nearly circular planar structure with a central B6 pentagonal unit bonded to an outer B13 ring. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that the B19− cluster possesses a unique double π-aromaticity in two concentric π-systems, with two π-electrons delocalized over the central pentagonal B6 unit and another ten π-electrons responsible for the π-bonding between the central pentagonal unit and the outer ring. Such peculiar chemical bonding does not exist in organic compounds; it can only be found in atomic clusters. A combined theoretical and experimental approach has been used to investigate the structure and bonding of an all-boron cluster (B19−). Calculations suggest that the minimum energy structure is a near-planar one — in which a pentagonal B6 unit is encircled by a larger B13 ring — possessing two concentric aromatic π systems.

Identification of active Zr–WOx clusters on a ZrO2 support for solid acid catalysts

Tungstated zirconia is a robust solid acid catalyst for light alkane (C4–C8) isomerization. Several structural models for catalytically active sites have been proposed, but the topic remains controversial, partly because of the absence of direct structural imaging information on the various supported WOx species. High-angle annular dark-field imaging of WO3/ZrO2 catalysts in an aberration-corrected analytical electron microscope allows, for the first time, direct imaging of the various species present. Comparison of the relative distribution of these WOx species in materials showing low and high catalytic activities has allowed the deduction of the likely identity of the catalytic active site—namely, subnanometre Zr–WOx clusters. This information has subsequently been used in the design of new catalysts, in which the activity of a poor catalyst has been increased by two orders of magnitude using a synthesis procedure that deliberately increases the number density of catalytically relevant active species. Small alkanes are typically isomerized on tungstated-alumina solid-acid catalysts, but the origin of the activity has been unclear. Now, high-resolution imaging has revealed subnanometre Zr-WOx clusters to be the active sites.

A single-molecule platform for investigation of interactions between G-quadruplexes and small-molecule ligands

Ligands that stabilize the formation of telomeric DNA G-quadruplexes have potential as cancer treatments, because the G-quadruplex structure cannot be extended by telomerase, an enzyme over-expressed in many cancer cells. Understanding the kinetic, thermodynamic and mechanical properties of small-molecule binding to these structures is therefore important, but classical ensemble assays are unable to measure these simultaneously. Here, we have used a laser tweezers method to investigate such interactions. With a force jump approach, we observe that pyridostatin promotes the folding of telomeric G-quadruplexes. The increased mechanical stability of pyridostatin-bound G-quadruplex permits the determination of a dissociation constant Kd of 490&nbsp;±&nbsp;80&nbsp;nM. The free-energy change of binding obtained from a Hess-like process provides an identical Kd for pyridostatin and a Kd of 42&nbsp;±&nbsp;3&nbsp;µM for a weaker ligand RR110. We anticipate that this single-molecule platform can provide detailed insights into the mechanical, kinetic and thermodynamic properties of liganded bio-macromolecules, which have biological relevance. G-quadruplex structures in telomeric DNA inhibit the action of telomerase — an enzyme over-expressed in many cancer cells. Small molecules that stabilize the formation of G-quadruplex structures are therefore of interest as potential cancer treatments. Here, a platform is described that allows the interactions between small-molecule ligands and human telomeric G-quadruplexes to be measured at the single-molecule level.

Reconstitution of a fungal meroterpenoid biosynthesis reveals the involvement of a novel family of terpene cyclases

Meroterpenoids are hybrid natural products of both terpenoid and polyketide origin. We identified a biosynthetic gene cluster that is responsible for the production of the meroterpenoid pyripyropene in the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus through reconstituted biosynthesis of up to five steps in a heterologous fungal expression system. The cluster revealed a previously unknown terpene cyclase with an unusual sequence and protein primary structure. The wide occurrence of this sequence in other meroterpenoid and indole–diterpene biosynthetic gene clusters indicates the involvement of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of various terpenoid-bearing metabolites produced by fungi and bacteria. In addition, a novel polyketide synthase that incorporated nicotinyl-CoA as the starter unit and a prenyltransferase, similar to that in ubiquinone biosynthesis, was found to be involved in the pyripyropene biosynthesis. The successful production of a pyripyropene analogue illustrates the catalytic versatility of these enzymes for the production of novel analogues with useful biological activities. The structural diversity of natural products offers great potential for the identification of new drugs. Here, the gene cluster responsible for the production of a meroterpenoid, pyripyropene, has been identified, and reconstitution of the biosynthetic sequence involved allows the production of analogous synthetic structures with potentially new bioactivity.

Uranyl oxo activation and functionalization by metal cation coordination

The oxo groups in the uranyl ion [UO2]2+—one of many oxo cations formed by metals from across the periodic table—are particularly inert, which explains the dominance of this ion in the laboratory and its persistence as an environmental contaminant. In contrast, transition metal oxo (M=O) compounds can be highly reactive and carry out difficult reactions such as the oxygenation of hydrocarbons. Here we show how the sequential addition of a lithium metal base to the uranyl ion constrained in a ‘Pacman’ environment results in lithium coordination to the U=O bonds and single-electron reduction. This reaction depends on the nature and stoichiometry of the lithium reagent and suggests that competing reduction and C–H bond activation reactions are occurring. Uranium oxo groups are very inert, in contrast with many transition metal oxo compounds that can carry out reactions that are difficult to achieve with other reagents. Now, the controlled lithiation of a ‘Pacman’ complex is shown to activate the uranium oxo group towards functionalization and single electron transfer.

Interfacial synthesis of hollow metal–organic framework capsules demonstrating selective permeability

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials that consist of metal ions and organic ligands linked together by coordination bonds. Because of their porosity and the possibility of combining large surface areas with pore characteristics that can be tailored, these solids show great promise for a wide range of applications. Although most applications currently under investigation are based on powdered solids, developing synthetic methods to prepare defect-free MOF layers will also enable applications based on selective permeation. Here, we demonstrate how the intrinsically hybrid nature of MOFs enables the self-completing growth of thin MOF layers. Moreover, these layers can be shaped as hollow capsules that demonstrate selective permeability directly related to the micropore size of the MOF crystallites forming the capsule wall. Such capsules effectively entrap guest species, and, in the future, could be applied in the development of selective microreactors containing molecular catalysts. The intrinsically hybrid nature of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) — microporous crystalline solids composed of metal ions and organic ligands — has been exploited to grow thin MOF films at the aqueous–organic interface of a biphasic reaction mixture. These materials exhibit selective permeability and can also be obtained as hollow capsules that have potential as microreactors.

Enantioselective iron-catalysed O–H bond insertions

The ready availability, low price and environmentally benign character of iron mean that it is an ideal alternative to precious metals in catalysis. Recent growth in the number of iron-catalysed reactions reported reflects an increasing demand for sustainable chemistry. Only a limited number of chiral iron catalysts have been reported and these have, in general, proven less enantioselective than other transition-metal catalysts, thus limiting their appeal. Here, we report that iron complexes of spiro-bisoxazoline ligands are highly efficient catalysts for asymmetric O–H bond insertion reactions. These complexes catalyse insertions into the O–H bond of a wide variety of alcohols and even water, with exceptional enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The selectivities surpass those obtained with other transition-metal catalysts. This study should inspire and encourage the use of iron instead of traditional precious metals in the development of greener catalysts for catalytic asymmetric synthesis. Iron is an abundant, low cost and environmentally benign metal. Here, iron complexes are shown to be the most effective catalysts for asymmetric O–H insertion reactions. These results should encourage the use of iron, rather than more traditional precious metals, in the development of greener organometallic catalysts for asymmetric transformations.

Title: 
Lewis acid-catalysed formation of two-dimensional phthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a new strategy for assembling organic semiconductors into robust networks with atomic precision and long-range order. General methods for COF synthesis will allow complex building blocks to be incorporated into these emerging materials. Here we report a new Lewis acid-catalysed protocol to form boronate esters directly from protected catechols and arylboronic acids. This transformation also provides crystalline boronate ester-linked COFs from protected polyfunctional catechols and bis(boronic acids). Using this method, we prepared a new COF that features a square lattice composed of phthalocyanine macrocycles joined by phenylene bis(boronic acid) linkers. The phthalocyanines stack in an eclipsed fashion within the COF to form 2.3&nbsp;nm pores that run parallel to the stacked chromophores. The material's broad absorbance over the solar spectrum, potential for efficient charge transport through the stacked phthalocyanines, good thermal stability and the modular nature of COF synthesis, show strong promise for applications in organic photovoltaic devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) organize organic subunits into predictable and precise networks with long-range order. The limited generality of methods for COF synthesis has thus far precluded the incorporation of complex building blocks into these emerging materials. Now, a new Lewis acid-catalysed protocol for boronic ester formation provides a two-dimensional COF containing stacked phthalocyanine chromophores.

Title: 
The role of non-covalent interactions in electrocatalytic fuel-cell reactions on platinum

The classic models of metal electrode–electrolyte interfaces generally focus on either covalent interactions between adsorbates and solid surfaces or on long-range electrolyte–metal electrostatic interactions. Here we demonstrate that these traditional models are insufficient. To understand electrocatalytic trends in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the oxidation of methanol on platinum surfaces in alkaline electrolytes, non-covalent interactions must be considered. We find that non-covalent interactions between hydrated alkali metal cations M+(H2O)x and adsorbed OH (OHad) species increase in the same order as the hydration energies of the corresponding cations (Li+&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Na+&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;K+&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Cs+) and also correspond to an increase in the concentration of OHad–M+(H2O)x clusters at the interface. These trends are inversely proportional to the activities of the ORR, the HOR and the oxidation of methanol on platinum (Cs+&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;K+&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Na+&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Li+), which suggests that the clusters block the platinum active sites for electrocatalytic reactions. Better understanding of the fundamental bonding interactions at electrified metal–liquid interfaces is critical for improving the electrochemical reactions of fuel cells, but now traditional models are shown to be insufficient. Using experimental measurements of various electrocatalytic reactions on platinum and density functional theory it is shown that non-covalent interactions must be considered.

Title: 
Controlled folding of synthetic polymer chains through the formation of positionable covalent bridges

Covalent bridges play a crucial role in the folding process of sequence-defined biopolymers. This feature, however, has not been recreated in synthetic polymers because, apart from some simple regular arrangements (such as block co-polymers), these macromolecules generally do not exhibit a controlled primary structure—that is, it is difficult to predetermine precisely the sequence of their monomers. Herein, we introduce a versatile strategy for preparing foldable linear polymer chains. Well-defined polymers were synthesized by the atom transfer radical polymerization of styrene. The controlled addition of discrete amounts of protected maleimide at precise times during the synthesis enabled the formation of polystyrene chains that contained positionable reactive alkyne functions. Intramolecular reactions between these functions subsequently led to the formation of different types of covalently folded polymer chains. For example, tadpole (P-shaped), pseudocyclic (Q-shaped), bicyclic (8-shaped) and knotted (α-shaped) macromolecular origamis were prepared in a relatively straightforward manner. Synthetic polymers are typically difficult to fold into particular origamis because the monomers can usually not be precisely organized along their backbones. Reactive alkyne groups have now been placed at specific locations in linear polystyrene chains, enabling those to be folded into predetermined shapes through intramolecular covalent bonding.

Interference structures in the differential cross-sections for inelastic scattering of NO by Ar

Inelastic scattering is a fundamental collisional process that plays an important role in many areas of chemistry, and its detailed study can provide valuable insight into more complex chemical systems. Here, we report the measurement of differential cross-sections for the rotationally inelastic scattering of NO(X2Π1/2, v&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, j&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5, f) by Ar at a collision energy of 530&nbsp;cm−1 in unprecedented detail, with full Λ-doublet (hence total NO parity) resolution in both the initial and final rotational quantum states. The observed differential cross-sections depend sensitively on the change in total NO parity on collision. Differential cross-sections for total parity-conserving and changing collisions have distinct, novel quantum-mechanical interference structures, reflecting different sensitivities to specific homonuclear and heteronuclear terms in the interaction potential. The experimental data agree remarkably well with rigorous quantum-mechanical scattering calculations, and reveal the role played by total parity in acting as a potential energy landscape filter. Differential cross sections for the rotationally inelastic scattering of NO by Ar are reported with unprecedented quantum-state resolution. The experiments give important details about the mechanism of this fundamental collisional process, providing evidence for a parity-dependent quantum-mechanical interference effect.

The maximum pentagon separation rule provides a guideline for the structures of endohedral metallofullerenes

Fullerenes tend to follow the isolated pentagon rule, which requires that each of the 12 pentagons is surrounded only by hexagons. Over the past decade many violations to this rule were reported for endohedral fullerenes. Based on the ionic model M3N6+@C2n6− and the orbital energies of the isolated cages, in 2005 we formulated a molecular orbital rule to identify the most suitable hosting cages in endohedral metallofullerenes. Now, we give physical support to the orbital rule, and we propose the maximum pentagon separation rule, which can be applied to either isolated pentagon rule cages or to non-isolated pentagon rule cages with the same number of adjacent pentagon pairs. The maximum pentagon separation rule can be formulated as 'The electron transfer from the internal cluster to the fullerene host preferentially adds electrons to the pentagons; therefore, the most suitable carbon cages are those with the largest separations among the 12 pentagons'. Stable fullerenes often follow the isolated pentagon rule, but there are increasing examples of compounds that do not. Now, a maximum pentagon separation rule is proposed, which predicts that the most stable cages are those with pentagons having the largest separation.

Selective incarceration of caesium ions by Venus flytrap action of a flexible framework sulfide

The selective capture of Cs+ from solution is relevant to the remediation of nuclear waste and remains a significant challenge. Here we describe a new framework composed of [(CH3)2NH2]+ and [Ga2Sb2S7]2− layers, which are perforated with holes. Shape selectivity couples with framework flexibility, allowing the compound to respond to the ion-exchange process. The size, shape and flexibility of the holes allow Cs+ ions in an aqueous solution to selectively pass through and enter the material via an ion-exchange process. Following capture, the structure dynamically closes its holes in a manner reminiscent of a Venus flytrap, which prevents the Cs+ ions from leaching out. This process has useful implications in the separation science of Cs as it relates to the clean-up of nuclear waste. The dynamic response we describe here provides important insights for designing new materials for the selective removal of difficult-to-capture ions. A perforated framework material of gallium antimony sulfide is able to selectively extract caesium ions from solution. After this capture, the holes close and prevent the ions leaching back out. This dynamic response could be used to remove caesium from nuclear waste.

Spontaneous assembly and real-time growth of micrometre-scale tubular structures from polyoxometalate-based inorganic solids

We report the spontaneous and rapid growth of micrometre-scale tubes from crystals of a metal oxide-based inorganic solid when they are immersed in an aqueous solution containing a low concentration of an organic cation. A membrane immediately forms around the crystal, and this membrane then forms micrometre-scale tubes that grow with vast aspect ratios at controllable rates along the surface on which the crystal is placed. The tubes are composed of an amorphous mixture of polyoxometalate-based anions and organic cations. It is possible for liquid to flow through the tubes, and for the direction of growth and the overall tube diameter to be controlled. We demonstrate that tube growth is driven by osmotic pressure within the membrane sack around the crystal, which ruptures to release the pressure. These robust, self-growing, micrometre-scale tubes offer opportunities in many areas, including the growth of microfluidic devices and the self-assembly of metal oxide-based semipermeable membranes for diverse applications. Adding low concentrations of aromatic organic cations to an aqueous solution in which polyoxometalate-based crystals are immersed leads to the spontaneous growth of tubular structures with controllable diameters. Tubes can be fused together to form junctions and are shown to act as channels through which liquids can flow.

Concise synthesis of ricciocarpin A and discovery of a more potent analogue

Cascade reactions enable the rapid build-up of molecular complexity from relatively simple starting materials. Both rapid construction and the ability to prepare related structures are crucial to the study of biological activities. Here, we report an efficient, highly enantioselective and diastereoselective total synthesis of ricciocarpin A. The key feature of the synthesis is a one-pot, three-step, organocatalytic reductive Michael–Tishchenko cascade. The conciseness and flexibility of this approach not only resulted in the synthesis of the natural product, but also of its antipode and four other structural analogues. A preliminary biological evaluation of these compounds identified an analogue with significantly improved molluscicidal activity. An organocatalytic cascade reaction allows the rapid construction of (+)-ricciocarpin A, which exhibits potent molluscicidal activity against the water snails Biomphalaria glabrata. The concise synthesis also allowed the synthesis of five analogues, one of which was shown to have significantly improved biological activity.

Coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism by chemical design

Although the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in one compound is rare, some examples of such materials are known to exist. Methods to physically prepare hybrid structures with both competing phases are also known, which rely on the nanofabrication of alternating conducting layers. Chemical methods of building up hybrid materials with organic molecules (superconducting layers) and metal complexes (magnetic layers) have provided examples of superconductivity with some magnetic properties, but not fully ordered. Now, we report a chemical design strategy that uses the self assembly in solution of macromolecular nanosheet building blocks to engineer the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in [Ni0.66Al0.33(OH)2][TaS2] at ∼4&nbsp;K. The method is further demonstrated in the isostructural [Ni0.66Fe0.33(OH)2][TaS2], in which the magnetic ordering is shifted from 4&nbsp;K to 16&nbsp;K. The co-existence of superconductivity and magnetism in single compounds is rare, and heterostructures containing both properties have only been made with complex techniques. Now, a molecular-building-block approach has been applied to match organic and inorganic layers to produce multifunctional materials.

A bonding model for gold(I) carbene complexes

The last decade has witnessed dramatic growth in the number of reactions catalysed by electrophilic gold complexes. Although proposed mechanisms often invoke the intermediacy of gold-stabilized cationic species, the nature of bonding in these intermediates remains unclear. Herein, we propose that the carbon–gold bond in these intermediates comprises varying degrees of both σ- and π-bonding; however, the overall bond order is generally less than or equal to one. The bonding in a given gold-stabilized intermediate, and the position of this intermediate on a continuum ranging from gold-stabilized singlet carbene to gold-coordinated carbocation is dictated by the carbene substituents and the ancillary ligand. Experiments show that the correlation between bonding and reactivity is reflected in the yield of gold-catalysed cyclopropanation reactions. An analysis of key intermediates relevant to gold(I) catalysis has been performed using density functional theory. A bonding model is proposed whereby the reactivity of gold(I)-coordinated carbenes is dependent on carbene substituents and ancillary ligands that dictate where these gold structures lie on a continuum ranging from a metal-stabilized singlet carbene to a metal-coordinated carbocation.

The transcription factor FOXM1 is a cellular target of the natural product thiostrepton

Transcription factors are proteins that bind specifically to defined DNA sequences to promote gene expression. Targeting transcription factors with small molecules to modulate the expression of certain genes has been notoriously difficult to achieve. The natural product thiostrepton is known to reduce the transcriptional activity of FOXM1, a transcription factor involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Herein we demonstrate that thiostrepton interacts directly with FOXM1 protein in the human breast cancer cells MCF-7. Biophysical analyses of the thiostrepton–FOXM1 interaction provide additional insights on the molecular mode of action of thiostrepton. In cellular experiments, we show that thiostrepton can inhibit the binding of FOXM1 to genomic target sites. These findings illustrate the potential druggability of transcription factors and provide a molecular basis for targeting the FOXM1 family with small molecules. The natural product thiostrepton is known to have anticancer properties but its mechanism of action is not known. Here, it is shown that thiostrepton binds to the protein FOXM1, preventing its interaction with several gene promoters and inhibits their expression. This illustrates the druggability of transcription factors, and provides a molecular basis for targeting FOXM1.

Type-zero copper proteins

Many proteins contain copper in a range of coordination environments, where it has various biological roles, such as transferring electrons or activating dioxygen. These copper sites can be classified by their function or spectroscopic properties. Those with a single copper atom are either type 1, with an intense absorption band near 600&nbsp;nm, or type 2, with weak absorption in the visible region. We have built a novel copper(ii) binding site within structurally modified Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurins that does not resemble either existing type, which we therefore call ‘type zero’. X-ray crystallographic analysis shows that these sites adopt distorted tetrahedral geometries, with an unusually short Cu–O (G45 carbonyl) bond. Relatively weak absorption near 800&nbsp;nm and narrow parallel hyperfine splittings in electron paramagnetic resonance spectra are the spectroscopic signatures of type zero copper. Cyclic voltammetric experiments demonstrate that the electron transfer reactivities of type-zero azurins are enhanced relative to that of the corresponding type 2 (C112D) protein. Copper-containing proteins can be classified into types 1 and 2, depending on their functional or spectroscopic properties. Now, a protein that fits neither type has been built using a scaffold made from the protein Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin.

Synthesis of cortistatins A, J, K and L

The cortistatins are a recently identified class of marine natural products characterized by an unusual steroidal skeleton, which have been found to inhibit differentially the proliferation of various mammalian cells in culture by an unknown mechanism. We describe a comprehensive route for the synthesis of cortistatins from a common precursor, which in turn is assembled from two fragments of similar structural complexity. Cortistatins A and J, and for the first time K and L, have been synthesized in parallel processes from like intermediates prepared from a single compound. With the identification of facile laboratory transformations linking intermediates in the cortistatin L synthetic series with corresponding intermediates to cortistatins A and J, we have been led to speculate that somewhat related paths might occur in nature, offering potential sequencing and chemical detail for cortistatin biosynthetic pathways. The cortistatins have attracted a lot of attention in the synthetic community because of their interesting biological activity. Here, four of the cortistatin family are prepared from a common precursor. This efficient synthesis will assist in an investigation of structure–activity relationships and understanding of the biosynthetic route to these compounds.

Singlet fission in pentacene through multi-exciton quantum states

Multi-exciton generation—the creation of multiple charge carrier pairs from a single photon—has been reported for several materials and may dramatically increase solar cell efficiency. Singlet fission, its molecular analogue, may govern multi-exciton generation in a variety of materials, but a fundamental mechanism for singlet fission has yet to be described. Here, we use sophisticated ab initio calculations to show that singlet fission in pentacene proceeds through rapid internal conversion of the photoexcited state into a dark state of multi-exciton character that efficiently splits into two triplets. We show that singlet fission to produce a pair of triplet excitons must involve an intermediate state that (i) has a multi-exciton character, (ii) is energetically accessible from the optically allowed excited state, and (iii) efficiently dissociates into multiple electron–hole pairs. The rational design of photovoltaic materials that make use of singlet fission will require similar ab initio analysis of multi-exciton states such as the dark state studied here. A fundamental mechanism for singlet fission, a process that may govern instances of multi-exciton generation, has yet to be described. Sophisticated calculations now show that singlet fission in pentacene proceeds through the conversion of a photoexcited state into a dark state of multi-exciton character that subsequently splits into two triplets.

Face-directed self-assembly of an electronically active Archimedean polyoxometalate architecture

The convergent assembly of metal–organic frameworks has enabled the design of porous materials using a structural building unit approach, but functional systems incorporating pre-assembled structural building unit ‘pore’ openings are rare. Here, we show that the face-directed assembly of a ring-shaped macrocyclic polyoxometalate structural building unit, {P8W48O184}40− with an integrated 1-nm pore as an ‘aperture synthon’, with manganese linkers yields a vast three-dimensional extended framework architecture based on a truncated cuboctahedron. The 1-nm-diameter entrance pores of the {P8W48O184}40− structural building unit lead to approximately spherical 7.24-nm3 cavities containing exchangeable alkali-metal cations that can be replaced by transition-metal ions through a cation exchange process. Control over this process can be exerted by either electrochemically switching the overall framework charge by manipulating the oxidation state of the manganese linker ions, or by physically gating the pores with large organic cations, thus demonstrating how metal–organic framework-like structures with integrated pores and new physical properties can be assembled. A wide range of porous framework materials has been assembled with a modular approach that takes advantage of prefabricated structural building units (SBUs). Now, it has been shown that functional all-inorganic frameworks can be made from a macrocyclic polyoxometalate SBU — that has a built-in aperture approximately 1&nbsp;nm in diameter — linked together with redox-switchable metal ions.

Title: 
Ion-triggered spring-like motion of a double helicate accompanied by anisotropic twisting

Molecules that extend and contract under external stimuli are used to build molecular machines with nanomechanical functions. But although common in biological systems, such extension and contraction motions with helical molecules have rarely been accompanied by unidirectional twisting in synthetic systems. Here we show that sodium ions can trigger the reversible anisotropic twisting of an enantiomeric double-stranded helicate, without racemization. An optically active helicate consisting of two tetraphenol strands bridged by two spiroborate groups sandwiches a sodium ion. On removal of the central sodium—through addition of a cryptand [2.2.1] in solution—the double helicate extends. Crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance studies reveal that the extended helicate is over twice as long as the initial molecule, and is twisted in the right-handed direction. Circular dichroism analysis suggests that the twisting doesn't affect the helicate's handedness. This anisotropic extension–contraction process is reversibly triggered by the successive addition and removal of sodium ions in solution. Helical molecules in biological systems commonly undergo extension, contraction and unidirectional twisting motions, but such twisting — promising for the construction of molecular machines — has rarely been achieved in synthetic systems. Now, a chiral double helix has been prepared whose spring-like motion is accompanied by an anisotropic twist under the control of sodium ions.

Single cells and intracellular processes studied by a plasmonic-based electrochemical impedance microscopy

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a crucial tool for the detection and study of various biological substances, from DNA and proteins to viruses and bacteria. It does not require any labelling species, and methods based on it have been developed to study cellular processes (such as cell spreading, adhesion, invasion, toxicology and mobility). However, data have so far lacked spatial information, which is essential for investigating heterogeneous processes and imaging high-throughput microarrays. Here, we report an electrochemical impedance microscope based on surface plasmon resonance that resolves local impedance with submicrometre spatial resolution. We have used an electrochemical impedance microscope to monitor the dynamics of cellular processes (apoptosis and electroporation of individual cells) with millisecond time resolution. The high spatial and temporal resolution makes it possible to study individual cells, but also resolve subcellular structures and processes without labels, and with excellent detection sensitivity (~2&nbsp;pS). We also describe a model that simulates cellular and electrochemical impedance microscope images based on local dielectric constant and conductivity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a useful tool for analysing biological substances, but it remains difficult to determine local details rather than average information over an electrode surface. Now, an electrochemical impedance microscope based on plasmonics has enabled the spatial and temporal study of cellular structures and processes, with submicrometre and millisecond resolutions.

Design principles for oxygen-reduction activity on perovskite oxide catalysts for fuel cells and metal–air batteries

The prohibitive cost and scarcity of the noble-metal catalysts needed for catalysing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal–air batteries limit the commercialization of these clean-energy technologies. Identifying a catalyst design principle that links material properties to the catalytic activity can accelerate the search for highly active and abundant transition-metal-oxide catalysts to replace platinum. Here, we demonstrate that the ORR activity for oxide catalysts primarily correlates to σ*-orbital (eg) occupation and the extent of B-site transition-metal–oxygen covalency, which serves as a secondary activity descriptor. Our findings reflect the critical influences of the σ* orbital and metal–oxygen covalency on the competition between O22–/OH– displacement and OH– regeneration on surface transition-metal ions as the rate-limiting steps of the ORR, and thus highlight the importance of electronic structure in controlling oxide catalytic activity. With the cost of noble metal oxygen-reduction catalysts rendering some fuel cells and batteries prohibitively expensive, the search for effective and cheaper catalysts is underway and would be speeded up by ‘design principles’. Now, the catalytic activity of oxide materials has been correlated to σ*-orbital occupation and the extent of metal–oxygen covalency.

Biodegradable nanostructures with selective lysis of microbial membranes

Macromolecular antimicrobial agents such as cationic polymers and peptides have recently been under an increased level of scrutiny because they can combat multi-drug-resistant microbes. Most of these polymers are non-biodegradable and are designed to mimic the facially amphiphilic structure of peptides so that they may form a secondary structure on interaction with negatively charged microbial membranes. The resulting secondary structure can insert into and disintegrate the cell membrane after recruiting additional polymer molecules. Here, we report the first biodegradable and in vivo applicable antimicrobial polymer nanoparticles synthesized by metal-free organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization of functional cyclic carbonate. We demonstrate that the nanoparticles disrupt microbial walls/membranes selectively and efficiently, thus inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and fungi, without inducing significant haemolysis over a wide range of concentrations. These biodegradable nanoparticles, which can be synthesized in large quantities and at low cost, are promising as antimicrobial drugs, and can be used to treat various infectious diseases such as MRSA-associated infections, which are often linked with high mortality. Macromolecules with antimicrobial properties are promising materials for combating multi-drug-resistant microbes. Now, it has been shown that amphiphilic cationic polycarbonates that are biodegradable can self-assemble into micellar nanoparticles that can kill gram-positive bacteria, MRSA and fungi efficiently, even at low concentrations. Moreover, no significant toxicity is observed during in vivo studies in mice.

A bidentate Lewis acid with a telluronium ion as an anion-binding site

The search for receptors that can selectively capture small and potentially toxic anions in protic media has sparked a renewed interest in the synthesis and anion-binding properties of polydentate Lewis acids. Seeking new paradigms to enhance the anion affinities of such systems, we synthesized a bidentate Lewis acid that contains a boryl and a telluronium moiety as Lewis acidic sites. Anion-complexation studies indicate that this telluronium borane displays a high affinity for fluoride in methanol. Structural and computational studies show that the unusual fluoride affinity of this bidentate telluronium borane can be correlated with the formation of a B–F&nbsp;→&nbsp;Te chelate motif supported by a strong lone-pair(F)&nbsp;→&nbsp;σ*(Te–C) donor–acceptor interaction. These results, which illustrate the viability of heavier chalcogenium centres as anion-binding sites, allow us to introduce a novel strategy for the design of polydentate Lewis acids with enhanced anion affinities. The design of receptors for the selective capture of F− is important because of the potential toxicity of this anion. Now, a telluronium borane has been shown to form a very stable fluoride chelate complex. The stability of the complex can be correlated to the Lewis acidity of the telluronium centre.

Title: 
Dianionic species with a bond consisting of two pentacoordinated silicon atoms

Silicon can form bonds to other tetracoordinated silicon atoms and these bonds form the framework of many organosilicon compounds and crystalline silicon. Silicon can also form a pentacoordinated anionic structure—a so-called ‘silicate’. No compounds containing a direct bond between two silicate moieties—‘disilicates’ where two silicate structures are combined in one species—have been reported because of the electronic repulsion between the anionic halves and difficulty preventing the release of anions. Here we report the synthesis of thermally stable and isolable disilicates by the reductive coupling reaction of a silane bearing two electron-withdrawing bidentate ligands. Two pentacoordinated silicons, positively charged despite the formal negative charge, constitute a single σ-bond and bind eight negatively charged atoms. They can be reversibly protonated, cleaving two Si–O bonds, to afford a tetracoordinated disilane. Their unique electronic properties could be promising for the construction of functional materials with silicon wire made up of silicate chains. Silicon, like carbon, favours a four-coordinate geometry and this underpins the frameworks of the wide range of inorganic and organosilicon compounds, from silicate minerals to polysilanes. Although some pentavalent silicon compounds have already been reported, this work presents the first example where two five-coordinate silicon atoms are bonded to each other.

Minimal nucleotide duplex formation in water through enclathration in self-assembled hosts

Short nucleotide fragments such as mono- and dinucleotides are generally unable to form stable hydrogen-bonded base pairs or duplexes in water. Within the hydrophobic pockets of enzymes, however, even short fragments form stable duplexes to transmit genetic information. Here, we demonstrate the efficient formation of hydrogen-bonded base pairs from mononucleotides in water through enclathration in the hydrophobic cavities of self-assembled cages. Crystallographic studies and 1H- and 15N-NMR spectroscopy clearly reveals pair-selective recognition of mononucleotides and the selective formation of an anti-Hoogsteen-type base pair in the cage's cavity. Within an analogous expanded cage, dinucleotides are also found to form a stable duplex in water. These results emphasize how hydrogen-bonded base pairing is amplified in a local hydrophobic area isolated from aqueous solution. Short nucleotides with just one or two bases do not generally form stable hydrogen-bonded pairs in water. Now, however, it has been shown that the hydrophobic interior of water-soluble coordination cages offers a sheltered environment in which stable duplexes can be formed.

Title: 
Networked molecular cages as crystalline sponges for fullerenes and other guests

Many molecular cages selectively bind guests in solution, but in the solid state close packing often prevents guest entry, which renders the cages inactive. We envisioned that coordination networks constructed from well-known molecular cages could transfer the richness of solution-state host–guest chemistry into the solid state. We report a crystalline coordination network generated from an infinite array of octahedral M6L4 cage subunits (M&nbsp;=&nbsp;metal, L&nbsp;=&nbsp;ligand). This coordination network is a ‘crystalline molecular sponge’ engineered on the molecular level and retains similar guest recognition properties to those found in solution. The network crystallinity is robust and thus X-ray diffraction analysis can be used to unambiguously observe single-crystal to single-crystal guest inclusion. The void spaces define alternating M12L8 and M12L24 cuboctahedral molecular cages and these large cages absorb up to 35 weight per cent of C60 or C70 by simply soaking the crystals in a toluene solution of the fullerene. When the crystals are immersed in fullerene mixtures, C70 is preferentially absorbed. The wealth of solution-chemistry properties of a well-known M6L4 coordination cage can be transferred into the solid state by networking the cage into a highly porous crystalline structure. The material behaves as a ‘fullerene sponge’, absorbing up to 35 wt% of C60 or C70 into the crystal, with a preference for C70 when exposed to mixtures of the two.

Title: 
Cascading transformations within a dynamic self-assembled system

Molecular subcomponents such as phosphate groups are often passed between biomolecules during complex signalling cascades, the flow of which define the motion of the machinery of life. Here, we show how an abiological system consisting of organic subcomponents knitted together by metal-ion coordination can respond to simple signals in complex ways. A CuI3 helicate transformed into its ZnII2CuI analogue following the addition of zinc(II), and the ejected copper(I) went on to induce the self-assembly of a CuI2 helicate from other free subcomponents present in solution. The addition of an additional subcomponent, 8-aminoquinoline, resulted in the formation of a third, more stable CuI3 helicate, requiring the destruction of both the ZnII2CuI and CuI2 helicates to scavenge sufficient CuI for the new structure. This system thus demonstrates two examples in which the application of one signal provokes two distinct responses involving the creation or destruction of complex assemblies as the system seeks thermodynamic equilibrium following perturbation. The addition of a single chemical signal can trigger multiple disassembly–reassembly events in a dynamic self-assembling system that is based on the formation and exchange of both imine and metal–ligand bonds. Different metal-helicate superstructures are either created or destroyed in response to the signal as the system seeks thermodynamic equilibrium following perturbation.

Title: 
Spongy chalcogels of non-platinum metals act as effective hydrodesulfurization catalysts

Aerogels are low-density porous materials, made mostly of air, for which hundreds of applications have been found in recent years. Inorganic oxide-based aerogels have been known for a long time, carbon aerogels were discovered in the early 1990s and sulfur- and selenium-based aerogels (chalcogels) are the most recent additions to this family. Here we present new aerogels made of Co(Ni)–Mo(W)–S networks with extremely large surface areas and porosity. These systems are formed by the coordinative reactions of (MoS4)2− and (WS4)2− with Co2+ and Ni2+ salts in non-aqueous solvents. We show that these low-density sponge-like networks can absorb conjugated organic molecules and mercury ions, and preferentially adsorb CO2 over H2, which illustrates their high potential as gas-separation media. The chalcogels are shown to be twice as active as the conventional sulfided Co–Mo/Al2O3 catalyst for the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene. Aerogels made from metal–sulfur networks show high absorption of conjugated organic molecules and mercury ions and can easily separate H2 from CO2. Compared with the conventional sulfided Co-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, these spongy, random porous networks are twice as active towards the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene.

Title: 
Metal-free carbon–carbon bond-forming reductive coupling between boronic acids and tosylhydrazones

The formation of carbon–carbon bonds is a fundamental transformation in organic synthesis. In spite of the myriad methods available, advantageous methodologies in terms of selectivity, availability of starting materials, operational simplicity, functional-group tolerance, environmental sustainability and economy are in constant demand. In this context, the development of new cross-coupling reactions that use catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic metals is attracting increasing attention. Similarly, efficient processes that do not require a metal catalyst are of extraordinary interest. Here, we report a new and efficient metal-free carbon–carbon bond-forming coupling between tosylhydrazones and boronic acids. This reaction is very general and functional-group tolerant. As the required tosylhydrazones are easily generated from carbonyl compounds, it can be seen as a reductive coupling of carbonyls, a process of high synthetic relevance that requires several steps using other methodologies. New economic and environmentally benign methods for achieving carbon–carbon bond formation are in constant demand. Here, a remarkably efficient and functional-group-tolerant, metal-free reductive cross-coupling of carbonyl compounds with boronic acids is described.

Title: 
Light-induced spin-crossover magnet

The light-induced phase transition between the low-spin (LS) and high-spin (HS) states of some transition-metal ions has been extensively studied in the fields of chemistry and materials science. In a crystalline extended system, magnetically ordering the HS sites of such transition-metal ions by irradiation should lead to spontaneous magnetization. Previous examples of light-induced ordering have typically occurred by means of an intermetallic charge transfer mechanism, inducing a change of valence of the metal centres. Here, we describe the long-range magnetic ordering of the extended FeII(HS) sites in a metal–organic framework caused instead by a light-induced excited spin-state trapping effect. The Fe–Nb-based material behaves as a spin-crossover magnet, in which a strong superexchange interaction (magnetic coupling through non-magnetic elements) between photo-produced FeII(HS) and neighbouring NbIV atoms operates through CN bridges. The magnetic phase transition is observed at 20&nbsp;K with a coercive field of 240&nbsp;Oe. In extended networks, light-induced magnetic ordering through spin change typically involves a charge-transfer mechanism, and thus a valence change of the magnetic metal centres. Now, such long-range ordering has been achieved in a three-dimensional metal–organic framework through the low-spin to high-spin transition of iron(II) centres, leading to a pronounced spontaneous magnetization.

Reactions of the inner surface of carbon nanotubes and nanoprotrusion processes imaged at the atomic scale

Although the outer surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes (atomically thin cylinders of carbon) can be involved in a wide range of chemical reactions, it is generally thought that the interior surface of nanotubes is unreactive. In this study, we show that in the presence of catalytically active atoms of rhenium inserted into nanotubes, the nanotube sidewall can be engaged in chemical reactions from the inside. Aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy operated at 80&nbsp;keV allows visualization of the formation of nanometre-sized hollow protrusions on the nanotube sidewall at the atomic level in real time at ambient temperature. Our direct observations and theoretical modelling demonstrate that the nanoprotrusions are formed in three stages: (i) metal-assisted deformation and rupture of the nanotube sidewall, (ii) the fast formation of a metastable asymmetric nanoprotrusion with an open edge and (iii) a slow symmetrization process that leads to a stable closed nanoprotrusion. The outer surfaces of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are known to participate in a range of chemical reactions, but the inner surfaces have so far been thought to be somewhat unreactive. Now, it has been shown that electron-beam irradiation of rhenium–fullerene complexes inside SWNTs can trigger reactions at the inner wall to form protrusions on the nanotube surface.

Title: 
Direct detection of CH/π interactions in proteins

XH/π interactions make important contributions to biomolecular structure and function. These weakly polar interactions, involving π-system acceptor groups, are usually identified from the three-dimensional structures of proteins. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to directly detect methyl/π (Me/π) interactions in proteins at atomic resolution. Density functional theory calculations predict the existence of weak scalar (J) couplings between nuclei involved in Me/π interactions. Using an optimized isotope-labelling strategy, these J couplings have been detected in proteins using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The resulting spectra provide direct experimental evidence of Me/π interactions in proteins and allow a simple and unambiguous assignment of donor and acceptor groups. The use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an elegant way to identify and experimentally characterize Me/π interactions in proteins without the need for arbitrary geometric descriptions or pre-existing three-dimensional structures. Weakly polar XH/π interactions are thought to be capable of influencing both the structure and function of proteins, but such interactions are usually identified from three-dimensional structural models. Now, using NMR spectroscopy and isotopic labelling, it has been shown that individual methyl/π interactions can be detected directly in proteins by measuring weak scalar couplings between the nuclei involved.

Loading and selective release of cargo in DNA nanotubes with longitudinal variation

Nanotubes hold promise for a number of biological and materials applications because of their high aspect ratio and encapsulation potential. A particularly attractive goal is to access nanotubes that exert well-defined control over their cargo, such as selective encapsulation, precise positioning of the guests along the nanotube length and triggered release of this cargo in response to specific external stimuli. Here, we report the construction of DNA nanotubes with longitudinal variation and alternating larger and smaller capsules along the tube length. Size-selective encapsulation of gold nanoparticles into the large capsules of these tubes leads to ‘nanopeapod’ particle lines with positioning of the particles 65&nbsp;nm apart. These nanotubes can then be opened when specific DNA strands are added to release their particle cargo spontaneously. This approach could lead to new applications of self-assembled nanotubes, such as in the precise organization of one-dimensional nanomaterials, gene-triggered selective delivery of drugs and biological sensing. Nanotubular structures made from different materials are being investigated for applications ranging from sensing to drug delivery, but controlling how they interact with ‘cargo’ molecules has proved challenging. Now, the selective uptake, precise positioning and triggered release of gold nanoparticles has been achieved with nanotubes assembled from triangular DNA building blocks.

Title: 
Catalytic enantioselective syn hydration of enones in water using a DNA-based catalyst

The enantioselective addition of water to olefins in an aqueous environment is a common transformation in biological systems, but was beyond the ability of synthetic chemists. Here, we present the first examples of a non-enzymatic catalytic enantioselective hydration of enones, for which we used a catalyst that comprises a copper complex, based on an achiral ligand, non-covalently bound to (deoxy)ribonucleic acid, which is the only source of chirality present under the reaction conditions. The chiral β-hydroxy ketone product was obtained in up to 82% enantiomeric excess. Deuterium-labelling studies demonstrated that the reaction is diastereospecific, with only the syn hydration product formed. So far, this diastereospecific and enantioselective reaction had no equivalent in conventional homogeneous catalysis. Nature frequently shows exquisite control over reactions both of water and in water. Here, the enantioselective conjugate addition of water to an enone — a reaction that has no equivalent in conventional homogeneous catalysis — is catalysed by a copper complex of an achiral ligand that is non-covalently bound to DNA.

Title: 
Stereoselective C–C bond formation catalysed by engineered carboxymethylproline synthases

The reaction of enol(ate)s with electrophiles is used extensively in organic synthesis for stereoselective C–C bond formation. Protein-based catalysts have had comparatively limited application for the stereoselective formation of C–C bonds of choice via enolate chemistry. We describe protein engineering studies on 5-carboxymethylproline synthases, members of the crotonase superfamily, aimed at enabling stereoselective C–C bond formation leading to N-heterocycles via control of trisubstituted enolate intermediates. Active site substitutions, including at the oxyanion binding site, enable the production of substituted N-heterocycles in high diastereomeric excesses via stereocontrolled enolate formation and reaction. The results reveal the potential of the ubiquitous crotonase superfamily as adaptable catalysts for the control of enolate chemistry. The reaction of enols and enolates with electrophiles is used extensively in synthesis. Here, protein engineering — substituting amino acid residues in an enzyme active site — is used to produce biocatalysts for the control of enolate chemistry. The adapted enzymes enable stereoselective C–C bond formation yielding N-heterocycles in high diastereomeric excess by the reaction of trisubstituted-enolates.

Title: 
Multiphoton photoresists giving nanoscale resolution that is inversely dependent on exposure time

Recent advances in materials science have made it possible to perform photolithography at the nanoscale using visible light. One approach to visible-light nanolithography (resolution augmentation through photo-induced deactivation) uses a negative-tone photoresist incorporating a radical photoinitiator that can be excited by two-photon absorption. With subsequent absorption of light, the photoinitiator can also be deactivated before polymerization occurs. This deactivation step can therefore be used for spatial limitation of photopatterning. In previous work, continuous-wave light was used for the deactivation step in such photoresists. Here we identify three broad classes of photoinitiators for which deactivation is efficient enough to be accomplished by the ultrafast excitation pulses themselves. The remarkable properties of these initiators result in the inverse scaling of lithographic feature size with exposure time. By combining different photoinitiators it is further possible to create a photoresist for which the resolution is independent of exposure over a broad range of fabrication speeds. A broad new class of commercially available multiphoton photoinitiators is identified, the properties of which result in the inverse scaling of photolithographic feature size with exposure time, rather than the usual proportional scaling. On combination with a conventional initiator, photoresists can be created for which the feature size is independent of exposure.

Title: 
Complete chiral symmetry breaking of an amino acid derivative directed by circularly polarized light

Circularly polarized light (CPL) emitted from star-forming regions is an attractive candidate as a cause of single chirality in nature. It has remained difficult, however, to translate the relatively small chemical effects observed on irradiation of molecular systems with CPL into high enantiomeric excesses. Here we demonstrate that irradiation of a racemic amino acid derivative with CPL leads to a small amount of chiral induction that can be amplified readily to give an enantiopure solid phase. A racemate composed of equal amounts of left- and right-handed crystals in contact with the irradiated solution is converted completely into crystals of single-handedness through abrasive grinding when racemization is effected in the solution. The rotation sense of the CPL fully determines the handedness of the final solid state. These findings illustrate the potential effectiveness of CPL in the control of molecular asymmetry, which is relevant for the origin of the single chirality inherent to many biological molecules. Complete chiral symmetry breaking of an amino acid derivative is achieved by circularly polarized light irradiation of a solution of the racemate in contact with racemic crystals, followed by abrasive grinding. The chirality of the amino acid derivative in the resultant crystals is fully determined by the rotation sense of the irradiation.

Title: 
Guest-induced growth of a surface-based supramolecular bilayer

Self-assembly of planar molecules on a surface can result in the formation of a wide variety of close-packed or porous structures. Two-dimensional porous arrays provide host sites for trapping guest species of suitable size. Here we show that a non-planar guest species (C60) can play a more complex role by promoting the growth of a second layer of host molecules (p-terphenyl-3,5,3″,5″-tetracarboxylic acid) above and parallel to the surface so that self-assembly is extended into the third dimension. The addition of guest molecules and the formation of the second layer are co-dependent. Adding a planar guest (coronene) can displace the C60 and cause reversion to a monolayer arrangement. The system provides an example of a reversible transformation between a planar and a non-planar supramolecular network, an important step towards the controlled self-assembly of functional, three-dimensional, surface-based supramolecular architectures. The self-assembly of planar molecules at interfaces can produce porous nanostructured surfaces that allow the selective trapping of guest molecules. By careful choice of both network and guest molecule it is possible to promote controlled, reversible growth perpendicular to the surface in the form of a molecular bilayer.

Title: 
A series of isoreticular chiral metal–organic frameworks as a tunable platform for asymmetric catalysis

Metal–organic frameworks, built by bridging metal ions with organic linkers, represent a new class of porous hybrid materials with attractive tunability in compositions, structures and functions. In particular, the mild conditions typically employed for their synthesis allow for the functionalization of their building blocks, and thus the rational design of novel materials. Here we demonstrate the systematic design of eight mesoporous chiral metal–organic frameworks, with the framework formula [LCu2(solvent)2] (where L is a chiral tetracarboxylate ligand derived from 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol), that have the same structures but channels of different sizes. Chiral Lewis acid catalysts were generated by postsynthesis functionalization with Ti(OiPr)4, and the resulting materials proved to be highly active asymmetric catalysts for diethylzinc and alkynylzinc additions, which converted aromatic aldehydes into chiral secondary alcohols. The enantioselectivities of these reactions can be modified by tuning the size of the channels, which alters the diffusion rates of the organic substrates. A series of chiral metal–organic frameworks with channels of tunable size have been modified through post-synthetic functionalization to bear catalytic centres along their pore walls. The resulting materials catalyse a carbon–carbon-bond-forming reaction, and the enantioselectivity of the transformation can be altered by changing the size of the channels.

Decorated carbon nanotubes with unique oxygen sensitivity

The relatively simple and robust architecture of microelectronic devices based on carbon nanotubes, in conjunction with their environmental sensitivity, places them among the leading candidates for incorporation into ultraportable or wearable chemical analysis platforms. We used single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) networks to establish a mechanistic understanding of the solid-state oxygen sensitivity of a Eu3+-containing dendrimer complex. After illumination with 365&nbsp;nm light, the SWNT networks decorated with the Eu3+ dendrimer show bimodal (optical spectroscopic and electrical conductance) sensitivity towards oxygen gas at room temperature under ambient pressure. We investigated the mechanism of this unique oxygen sensitivity with time-resolved and steady-state optical spectroscopy, analysis of excited-state luminescence lifetimes and solid-state electrical transport measurements. We demonstrate a potential application of this system by showing a reversible and linear electrical response to oxygen gas in the tested range (5–27%). Carbon-nanotube networks have been used to study the sensitivity to molecular oxygen of a dendrimer complexed with europium ions. Optically transparent devices made by coating nanotubes with the metal-containing dendrimer show a linear and reversible electrical response to O2, and may prove useful for oxygen-sensing applications.

Chemoenzymatic synthesis of differentially protected 3-deoxysugars

3-Deoxysugars are important constituents of complex carbohydrates. For example, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) is an essential component of lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulosonic acid (KDN) is widely found in carbohydrates of the bacterial cell wall and in lower vertebrates, and sialic acid is a common cap of mammalian glycoproteins. Although ready access to such sugars would benefit the creation of vaccine candidates, antibiotics and small-molecule drugs, their chemical synthesis is difficult. Here we present a simple chemoenzymatic method for preparing differentially protected 3-deoxysugar derivatives from readily available starting materials. It exploits the promiscuous aldolase activity of the enzyme macrophomate synthase (MPS) to add pyruvate enolate diastereoselectively to a wide range of structurally complex aldehydes. A short synthesis of KDN illustrates the utility of this approach. Enzyme promiscuity, which putatively fosters large functional leaps in natural evolution, has great promise as a source of synthetically useful catalytic transformations. Ready access to sugars in which the various hydroxyl groups are differentially protected will be of benefit in the production of vaccines, antibiotics and drugs. Here, a chemoenzymatic method that provides a direct route to such protected sugars is described.

Room-temperature molecular-resolution characterization of self-assembled organic monolayers on epitaxial graphene

Graphene, a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, is a promising material for next-generation technology because of its advantageous electronic properties, such as extremely high carrier mobilities. However, chemical functionalization schemes are needed to integrate graphene with the diverse range of materials required for device applications. In this paper, we report self-assembled monolayers of the molecular semiconductor perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) formed on epitaxial graphene grown on the SiC(0001) surface. The molecules possess long-range order with a herringbone arrangement, as shown by ultra-high vacuum scanning tunnelling microscopy at room temperature. The molecular ordering is unperturbed by defects in the epitaxial graphene or atomic steps in the underlying SiC surface. Scanning tunnelling spectra of the PTCDA monolayer show distinct features that are not observed on pristine graphene. The demonstration of robust, uniform organic functionalization of epitaxial graphene presents opportunities for graphene-based molecular electronics and sensors. The unique physical properties of graphene make it a promising material for the construction of nanoelectronic devices. In order to tailor its surface properties and enable it to be integrated with other components, it has now been shown that stable and robust organic monolayers can be formed on graphene at room temperature.

Measuring oxygen reduction/evolution reactions on the nanoscale

The efficiency of fuel cells and metal–air batteries is significantly limited by the activation of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Despite the well-recognized role of oxygen reaction kinetics on the viability of energy technologies, the governing mechanisms remain elusive and until now have been addressable only by macroscopic studies. This lack of nanoscale understanding precludes optimization of material architecture. Here, we report direct measurements of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and oxygen vacancy diffusion on oxygen-ion conductive solid surfaces with sub-10&nbsp;nm resolution. In electrochemical strain microscopy, the biased scanning probe microscopy tip acts as a moving, electrocatalytically active probe exploring local electrochemical activity. The probe concentrates an electric field in a nanometre-scale volume of material, and bias-induced, picometre-level surface displacements provide information on local electrochemical processes. Systematic mapping of oxygen activity on bare and platinum-functionalized yttria-stabilized zirconia surfaces is demonstrated. This approach allows direct visualization of the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activation process at the triple-phase boundary, and can be extended to a broad spectrum of oxygen-conductive and electrocatalytic materials. Optimizing oxygen-reduction and -evolution reactions is crucial for improving fuel cell efficiency, but the reaction is poorly understood at the nanoscopic level. Now, the oxygen activity of a platinum-functionalized surface has been mapped at below 10-nm resolution using electrochemical strain microscopy.

Synthesis of polyynes to model the sp-carbon allotrope carbyne

Carbyne is an allotrope of carbon composed of sp-hybridized carbon atoms. Although its formation in the laboratory is suggested, no well-defined sample is described. Interest in carbyne and its potential properties remains intense because of, at least in part, technological breakthroughs offered by other carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene. Here, we describe the synthesis of a series of conjugated polyynes as models for carbyne. The longest of the series consists of 44 contiguous acetylenic carbons, and it maintains a framework clearly composed of alternating single and triple bonds. Spectroscopic analyses for these polyynes reveal a distinct trend towards a finite gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for carbyne, which is estimated to be ∼485&nbsp;nm (∼2.56&nbsp;eV). Even the longest members of this series of polyynes are not particularly sensitive to light, moisture or oxygen, and they can be handled and characterized under normal laboratory conditions. The structure of the carbon allotrope ‘carbyne’ is based on a framework of sp-hybridized carbon. To model its properties, a series of conjugated polyynes — the longest of which contains 44 contiguous acetylenic carbons — have been synthesized and their spectroscopic properties investigated.

Title: 
Reversible dioxygen binding in solvent-free liquid myoglobin

The ensemble of forces that stabilize protein structure and facilitate biological function are intimately linked with the ubiquitous aqueous environment of living systems. As a consequence, biomolecular activity is highly sensitive to the interplay of solvent–protein interactions, and deviation from the native conditions, for example by exposure to increased thermal energy or severe dehydration, results in denaturation and subsequent loss of function. Although certain enzymes can be extracted into non-aqueous solvents without significant loss of activity, there are no known examples of solvent-less (molten) liquids of functional metalloproteins. Here we describe the synthesis and properties of room-temperature solvent-free myoglobin liquids with near-native structure and reversible dioxygen binding ability equivalent to the haem protein under physiological conditions. The realization of room-temperature solvent-free myoglobin liquids with retained function presents novel challenges to existing theories on the role of solvent molecules in structural biology, and should offer new opportunities in protein-based nanoscience and bionanotechnology. Freeze-drying of aqueous myoglobin–polymer surfactant nanoconjugates affords a water-free solid that melts at room temperature to produce a viscous solventless liquid protein that exhibits near-native secondary structure and reversible dioxygen binding. The results challenge the accepted role of solvent molecules in mediating protein structure and function, and offer new opportunities in protein-based nanoscience and bionanotechnology.

Diverting non-haem iron catalysed aliphatic C–H hydroxylations towards desaturations

Carboxylate-ligated, non-haem iron enzymes demonstrate the capacity for catalysing such remarkable processes as hydroxylations, chlorinations and desaturations of inert, aliphatic C–H bonds. A key to functional diversity is the enzymes' ability to divert fleeting radicals towards different types of functionalization using active site and/or substrate modifications. We report that a non-haem iron hydroxylase catalyst [Fe(PDP)] can also be diverted to catalytic, mixed hydroxylase/desaturase activity with aliphatic C–H bonds. Using a taxane-based radical trap that rearranges under Fe(PDP) oxidation to furnish a nortaxane skeleton, we provide the first direct evidence for a substrate radical using this class of stereoretentive hydroxylation catalysts. Hydroxylation and desaturation proceed by means of a short-lived radical that diverges in a substrate-dependent manner in the presence of carboxylic acids. The novel biomimetic reactivity displayed by this small molecule catalyst is harnessed to diversify natural product derivatives as well as interrogate their biosynthetic pathways. Non-haem iron catalyst [Fe(PDP)] promotes mixed oxygenase/desaturase activity from unactivated, aliphatic C–H bonds. This novel reactivity is substrate dependent, relying on the presence of a carboxylic acid, and proceeds via a short-lived carbon-centred radical. Direct evidence for this intermediate is provided through rearrangement of a novel taxane-based radical probe.

A robust molecular platform for non-volatile memory devices with optical and magnetic responses

Bistable molecules that behave as switches in solution have long been known. Systems that can be reversibly converted between two stable states that differ in their physical properties are particularly attractive in the development of memory devices when immobilized in substrates. Here, we report a highly robust surface-confined switch based on an electroactive, persistent organic radical immobilized on indium tin oxide substrates that can be electrochemically and reversibly converted to the anion form. This molecular bistable system behaves as an extremely robust redox switch in which an electrical input is transduced into optical as well as magnetic outputs under ambient conditions. The fact that this molecular surface switch, operating at very low voltages, can be patterned and addressed locally, and also has exceptionally high long-term stability and excellent reversibility and reproducibility, makes it a very promising platform for non-volatile memory devices. The creation of ‘smart surfaces’ that can act as switches or memory devices will rely on systems with bistable states that can be interconverted externally. Now, a low-voltage and robust surface-confined switch that transduces an electrical input into an optical and magnetic output is described.

Efficient stereo- and regioselective hydroxylation of alkanes catalysed by a bulky polyoxometalate

Direct functionalization of alkanes by oxidation of C–H bonds to form alcohols under mild conditions is a challenge for synthetic chemistry. Most alkanes contain a large number of C–H bonds that present difficulties for selectivity, and the oxidants employed often result in overoxidation. Here we describe a divanadium-substituted phosphotungstate that catalyses the stereo- and regioselective hydroxylation of alkanes with hydrogen peroxide as the sole oxidant. Both cyclic and acyclic alkanes were oxidized to form alcohols with greater than 96% selectivity. The bulky polyoxometalate framework of the catalyst results in an unusual selectivity that can lead to the oxidation of secondary rather than the weaker tertiary C–H bonds. The catalyst also avoids wasteful decomposition of the stoichiometric oxidant, which can result in the production of hydroxyl radicals and lead to non-selective oxidation and overoxidation of the desired products. The ability to selectively transform the C–H bonds of simple alkanes to useful functional groups such as alcohols is a key step in the move away from petrochemical feedstocks. Now, it has been shown that the oxidation of alkanes can be catalysed by a bulky polyoxometalate species using hydrogen peroxide as a stoichiometric oxidant.

Macroscopic self-assembly through molecular recognition

Molecular recognition plays an important role in nature, with perhaps the best known example being the complementarity exhibited by pairs of nucleobases in DNA. Studies of self-assembling and self-organizing systems based on molecular recognition are often performed at the molecular level, however, and any macroscopic implications of these processes are usually far removed from the specific molecular interactions. Here, we demonstrate that well-defined molecular-recognition events can be used to direct the assembly of macroscopic objects into larger aggregated structures. Acrylamide-based gels functionalized with either host (cyclodextrin) rings or small hydrocarbon-group guest moieties were synthesized. Pieces of host and guest gels are shown to adhere to one another through the mutual molecular recognition of the cyclodextrins and hydrocarbon groups on their surfaces. By changing the size and shape of the host and guest units, different gels can be selectively assembled and sorted into distinct macroscopic structures that are on the order of millimetres to centimetres in size. Specific molecular-recognition interactions are often used to build supramolecular architectures on very small length scales — typically those of molecules or macromolecules. Now, it has been shown that a host-guest system based on cyclodextrin rings and hydrocarbon groups can be used to direct the self-assembly of objects from macroscopic gel-based building blocks.

Enantioselective sulfonylation reactions mediated by a tetrapeptide catalyst

Nature excels at performing selective modifications of complex polyfunctional molecules by tailoring enzymes, but synthetic chemistry has lagged behind in this regard. In prior work, we have applied a biomimetic approach to this problem, developing small peptides to achieve various group transfer reactions on polyol substrates with high enantio- or regioselectivity. The use of sulfonates as synthetic building blocks and the scarcity of direct, selective methods for their preparation prompted our investigation into this area. In this article we report the development of a π-methyl histidine-based tetrameric peptide that effects the desymmetrization of meso-1,3-diols through enantioselective mono(sulfonylation). The catalyst exhibits structural similarities to another catalyst found to be effective in orthogonal group transfers, but results in modification of the enantiotopic alcohol. The practical and mechanistic implications of this discovery may extend beyond synthetic considerations and provide analogies to the diverse roles of histidine in enzyme active sites. Small peptide-derived catalysts are shown to be effective in the enantioselective sulfonylation of polyols. The observation that, using closely related catalysts, enantiotopic alcohols can be phosphorylated or sulfonylated, raises questions about the details of catalyst–substrate recognition and, from a biomimetic standpoint, the role of histidine residues in enzyme active sites.

Synergistic organocatalysis in the kinetic resolution of secondary thiols with concomitant desymmetrization of an anhydride

Kinetic resolution is an important method for the separation of racemates into their component enantiomers. Thiols are precursors to a variety of organosulfur compounds, with high utility in both chemistry and chemical biology, yet there is a surprising dearth of methodologies for their direct and efficient catalytic kinetic resolution. Here, we demonstrate an organocatalytic process involving the highly enantioselective desymmetrization of an achiral electrophile with the simultaneous kinetic resolution of a racemic thiol. The preparative potential of the methodology is exemplified by the synthesis of a drug precursor antipode in excellent yield and enantioselectivity as a by-product of a process that also resolves a sec-thiol substrate with a selectivity of S&nbsp;=&nbsp;226 (that is, both thiol antipodes produced in &gt;95% ee at 51% conversion). In a second example a racemic sec-thiol representing the stereocentre-containing core of the anti-asthma drug (R)-Montelukast was resolved with synthetically useful selectivity under mild conditions. Chiral thiols and organosulfur compounds are important in many areas of chemistry but there are relatively few methods available for their efficient enantioselective synthesis. Here, a kinetic resolution of chiral thiols is reported along with a demonstration that a concomitant desymmetrization of the acylating agent is beneficial for the selectivity of both processes.

Facile removal of stabilizer-ligands from supported gold nanoparticles

Metal nanoparticles that comprise a few hundred to several thousand atoms have many applications in areas such as photonics, sensing, medicine and catalysis. Colloidal methods have proven particularly suitable for producing small nanoparticles with controlled morphologies and excellent catalytic properties. Ligands are necessary to stabilize nanoparticles during synthesis, but once the particles have been deposited on a substrate the presence of the ligands is detrimental for catalytic activity. Previous methods for ligand removal have typically involved thermal and oxidative treatments, which can affect the size or morphology of the particles, in turn altering their catalytic activity. Here, we report a procedure to effectively remove the ligands without affecting particle morphology, which enhances the surface exposure of the nanoparticles and their catalytic activity over a range of reactions. This may lead to developments of nanoparticles prepared by colloidal methods for applications in fields such as environmental protection and energy production. Small nanoparticles with controlled morphologies can be prepared for catalysis applications by colloidal methods using stabilizing ligands. A solvent-extraction method has now been described that removes the ligands without affecting the morphology of the nanoparticles, or their catalytic activity over a range of reactions.

Highly stable tetrathiafulvalene radical dimers in [3]catenanes

Two [3]catenane ‘molecular flasks’ have been designed to create stabilized, redox-controlled tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) dimers, enabling their spectrophotometric and structural properties to be probed in detail. The mechanically interlocked framework of the [3]catenanes creates the ideal arrangement and ultrahigh local concentration for the encircled TTF units to form stable dimers associated with their discrete oxidation states. These dimerization events represent an affinity umpolung, wherein the inversion in electronic affinity replaces the traditional TTF-bipyridinium interaction, which is over-ridden by stabilizing mixed-valence (TTF)2•+ and radical-cation (TTF•+)2 states inside the ‘molecular flasks.’ The experimental data, collected in the solid state as well as in solution under ambient conditions, together with supporting quantum mechanical calculations, are consistent with the formation of stabilized paramagnetic mixed-valence dimers, and then diamagnetic radical-cation dimers following subsequent one-electron oxidations of the [3]catenanes. Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-based [3]catenanes are shown to display multiple stable redox states dominated by TTF···TTF radical dimer interactions occurring within the cavity of what is essentially a ‘molecular flask’. These stabilizing interactions are found to be the basis of a novel recognition motif that can be employed to drive molecular switching under redox control.

Highly diastereoselective Csp3–Csp2 Negishi cross-coupling with 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-substituted cycloalkylzinc compounds

Stereoselective functionalizations of organic molecules are of great importance to modern synthesis. A stereoselective preparation of pharmaceutically active molecules is often required to ensure the appropriate biological activity. Thereby, diastereoselective methods represent valuable tools for an efficient set-up of multiple stereocentres. In this article, highly diastereoselective Csp3 Negishi cross-couplings of various cycloalkylzinc reagents with aryl halides are reported. In all cases, the thermodynamically most-stable stereoisomer was obtained. Remarkably, this diastereoselective coupling was successful not only for 1,2-substituted cyclic systems, but also for 1,3- and 1,4-substituted cyclohexylzinc reagents. The origin of this remote stereocontrol was investigated by NMR experiments and density functional theory calculations. A detailed mechanism based on these experimental and theoretical data is proposed. Highly diastereoselective Negishi cross-coupling reactions between 2-, 3- and 4-substituted cycloalkylzinc reagents and aryl iodides are described. In all cases, the thermodynamically most stable diastereomers of the cross-coupling products were obtained. NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations were performed in order to rationalize the observed stereoselectivities.

Metal–nucleic acid cages

Metal–nucleic acid cages are a promising new class of materials. Like metallo-supramolecular cages, these systems can use their metals for redox, photochemical, magnetic and catalytic control over encapsulated cargo. However, using DNA provides the potential to program pore size, geometry, chemistry and addressability, and the ability to symmetrically and asymmetrically position transition metals within the three-dimensional framework. Here we report the quantitative construction of metal–DNA cages, with the site-specific incorporation of a range of metals within a three-dimensional DNA architecture. Oligonucleotide strands containing specific environments suitable for transition-metal coordination were first organized into two DNA triangles. These triangles were then assembled into a DNA prism with linking strands. Metal centres were subsequently incorporated into the prisms at the pre-programmed locations. This unprecedented ability to position transition metals within a three-dimensional framework could lead to metal–DNA hosts with applications for the encapsulation, sensing, modification and release of biomolecules and nanomaterials. Incorporating binding sites for metal ions into DNA strands that assemble into well-defined three-dimensional structures has enabled researchers to build metal-nucleic acid cages. There is potential for the geometry, pore size and chemistry of such materials to be easily tuned, which may prove useful for applications in molecular sensing and encapsulation.

Manipulating single-wall carbon nanotubes by chemical doping and charge transfer with perylene dyes

Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are emerging as materials with much potential in several disciplines, in particular in electronics and photovoltaics. The combination of SWNTs with electron donors or acceptors generates active materials, which can produce electrical energy when irradiated. However, SWNTs are very elusive species when characterization of their metastable states is required. This problem mainly arises because of the polydispersive nature of SWNT samples and the inevitable presence of SWNTs in bundles of different sizes. Here, we report the complete and thorough characterization of an SWNT radical ion-pair state induced by complexation with a perylene dye, which combines excellent electron-accepting and -conducting features with a five-fused ring π-system. At the same time, the perylene dye enables the dispersion of SWNTs by means of π–π interactions, which gives individual SWNTs in solution. This work clears a path towards electronic and optoelectronic devices in which regulated electrical transport properties are important. Using carbon nanotubes in electronic or photovoltaic devices generates active metastable states. These elusive species are hard to characterize because of the polydisperse and aggregate nature of nanotube bundles. A complete characterization of the radical–ion pair state has now been achieved using a range of techniques.

Title: 
Distortion-triggered loss of long-range order in solids with bonding energy hierarchy

An amorphous-to-crystal transition in phase-change materials like Ge–Sb–Te is widely used for data storage. The basic principle is to take advantage of the property contrast between the crystalline and amorphous states to encode information; amorphization is believed to be caused by melting the materials with an intense laser or electrical pulse and subsequently quenching the melt. Here, we demonstrate that distortions in the crystalline phase may trigger a collapse of long-range order, generating the amorphous phase without going through the liquid state. We further show that the principal change in optical properties occurs during the distortion of the still crystalline structure, upsetting yet another commonly held belief that attributes the change in properties to the loss of long-range order. Furthermore, our results suggest a way to lower energy consumption by condensing phase change inducing energy into shorter pulses or through the use of coherent phonon excitation. Some memory materials rely on a phase change between crystalline and amorphous phases that is triggered by a laser or electrical pulse. Although it is commonly believed that the materials go through a liquid phase, it is now shown that this may not always be the case.

Title: 
Selective sorption of oxygen and nitric oxide by an electron-donating flexible porous coordination polymer

Porous coordination polymers are materials formed from metal ions that are bridged together by organic linkers and that can combine two seemingly contradictory properties—crystallinity and flexibility. Porous coordination polymers can therefore create highly regular yet dynamic nanoporous domains that are particularly promising for sorption applications. Here, we describe the effective selective sorption of dioxygen and nitric oxide by a structurally and electronically dynamic porous coordination polymer built from zinc centres and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) as a linker. In contrast to a variety of other gas molecules (C2H2, Ar, CO2, N2 and CO), O2 and NO are accommodated in its pores. This unprecedented preference arises from the concerted effect of the charge-transfer interaction between TCNQ and these guests, and the switchable gate opening and closing of the pores of the framework. This system provides further insight into the efficient recognition of small gas molecules. Porous coordination polymers can form materials that are both crystalline and flexible, creating regular yet dynamic channels that are promising for guest sorption. Guest selectivity is difficult to achieve, however, and typically relies on size- or shape-recognition. A framework has now been assembled that combines charge-transfer interactions and structural flexibility to only accommodate O2 and NO.

Title: 
Redox-responsive molecular helices with highly condensed π-clouds

Helices have long attracted the attention of chemists, both for their inherent chiral structure and their potential for applications such as the separation of chiral compounds or the construction of molecular machines. As a result of steric forces, polymeric o-phenylenes adopt a tight helical conformation in which the densely packed phenylene units create a highly condensed π-cloud. Here, we show an oligomeric o-phenylene that undergoes a redox-responsive dynamic motion. In solution, the helices undergo a rapid inversion. During crystallization, however, a chiral symmetry-breaking phenomenon is observed in which each crystal contains only one enantiomeric form. Crystals of both handedness are obtained, but in a non-racemic mixture. Furthermore, in solution, the dynamic motion of the helical oligomer is dramatically suppressed by one-electron oxidation. X-ray crystallography of both the neutral and oxidized forms indicated that a hole, generated upon oxidation, is shared by the repeating o-phenylene units. This enables conformational locking of the helix, and represents a long-lasting chiroptical memory. Phenylene oligomers are shown to form left- and right-handed helices in solution, but a chiral symmetry-breaking process occurs on crystallization to give a non-racemic mixture of crystals that each contains only one enantiomer. One-electron oxidation of the oligomers suppresses the interconversion of the mirror-image helices in solution, locking-in one conformation and leading to chiral memory effects.

Enhancement of anhydrous proton transport by supramolecular nanochannels in comb polymers

Transporting protons is essential in several biological processes as well as in renewable energy devices, such as fuel cells. Although biological systems exhibit precise supramolecular organization of chemical functionalities on the nanoscale to effect highly efficient proton conduction, to achieve similar organization in artificial systems remains a daunting challenge. Here, we are concerned with transporting protons on a micron scale under anhydrous conditions, that is proton transfer unassisted by any solvent, especially water. We report that proton-conducting systems derived from facially amphiphilic polymers that exhibit organized supramolecular assemblies show a dramatic enhancement in anhydrous conductivity relative to analogous materials that lack the capacity for self-organization. We describe the design, synthesis and characterization of these macromolecules, and suggest that nanoscale organization of proton-conducting functionalities is a key consideration in obtaining efficient anhydrous proton transport. Efficient conduction of protons on a micrometre scale is critical for the development of fuel cell membranes — a key component of clean energy sources. Now, self-assembling amphiphilic polymers have been shown to provide a nanoscale organization of proton-conducting functionalities that dramatically increases anhydrous proton conductivity.

In silico design of tubulin-targeted antimitotic peptides

Microtubules are polymeric structures formed by the self-assembly of tubulin dimers. The growth and shrinkage of these dynamic arrays have a key role during the cell-proliferation process. This makes tubulin the molecular target of many anticancer drugs currently in use or under clinical trial. Their impressive success is limited by the onset of resistant tumour cells during the treatment, so new resistance-proof molecules need to be developed. Here we use molecular dynamics and free-energy calculations to study the network of interactions that allow microtubule formation. Modelling the protein–protein interface allows us to identify the amino acids responsible for tubulin–tubulin binding and thus to design peptides, which correspond to tubulin subsequences, that interfere with microtubule formation. We show that the application of molecular modelling techniques leads to the identification of peptides that exhibit antitubulin activity both in vitro and in cultured cells. The development of molecules that target protein–protein interactions is one of the main goals of contemporary medicinal chemistry. Computational alanine scanning and molecular dynamics now leads to the identification of two peptide sequences that are important in microtubule assembly, and shows that the in silico activity can be translated into in vitro activity.

Title: 
A primary hydrogen–deuterium isotope effect observed at the single-molecule level

The covalent chemistry of reactants tethered within a single protein pore can be monitored by observing the time-dependence of ionic current flow through the pore, which responds to bond making and breaking in individual reactant molecules. Here we use this ‘nanoreactor’ approach to examine the reaction of a quinone with a thiol to form a substituted hydroquinone by reductive 1,4-Michael addition. Remarkably, a primary hydrogen–deuterium isotope effect is readily detected at the single-molecule level during prototropic rearrangement of an initial adduct. The observation of individual reaction intermediates allows the measurement of an isotope effect whether or not the step involved is rate limiting, which would not be the case in an ensemble measurement. When anchored inside a protein pore, the bond-making and bond-breaking events of a single reacting molecule can be detected by alterations in current flow. This approach is used to detect a hydrogen–deuterium kinetic isotope effect. The single-molecule measurements provide information not available from experiments on an ensemble system.

Control and induction of surface-confined homochiral porous molecular networks

Homochirality is essential to many biological systems, and plays a pivotal role in various technological applications. The generation of homochirality and an understanding of its mechanism from the single-molecule to supramolecular level have received much attention. Two-dimensional chirality is a subject of intense interest due to the unique possibilities and consequences of confining molecular self-assembly to surfaces or interfaces. Here, we report the perfect generation of two-dimensional homochirality of porous molecular networks at the liquid–solid interface in two different ways: (i) by self-assembly of homochiral building blocks and (ii) by self-assembly of achiral building blocks in the presence of a chiral modifier via a hierarchical structural recognition process, as revealed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. The present results provide important impetus for the development of two-dimensional crystal engineering and may afford opportunities for the utilization of chiral nanowells in chiral recognition processes, as nanoreactors and as data storage systems. The generation of two-dimensional homochiral porous molecular networks at the liquid–solid interface is described. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, the formation of homochiral porous networks was observed both from solutions of homochiral molecules and from solutions of achiral molecules in the presence of a small amount of a chiral modifier.

A microdroplet dilutor for high-throughput screening

Pipetting and dilution are universal processes used in chemical and biological laboratories to assay and experiment. In microfluidics such operations are equally in demand, but difficult to implement. Recently, droplet-based microfluidics has emerged as an exciting new platform for high-throughput experimentation. However, it is challenging to vary the concentration of droplets rapidly and controllably. To this end, we developed a dilution module for high-throughput screening using droplet-based microfluidics. Briefly, a nanolitre-sized sample droplet of defined concentration is trapped within a microfluidic chamber. Through a process of droplet merging, mixing and re-splitting, this droplet is combined with a series of smaller buffer droplets to generate a sequence of output droplets that define a digital concentration gradient. Importantly, the formed droplets can be merged with other reagent droplets to enable rapid chemical and biological screens. As a proof of concept, we used the dilutor to perform a high-throughput homogeneous DNA-binding assay using only nanolitres of sample. Droplet microfluidics offer a convenient platform for high-throughput experimentation. It has been difficult, however, to rapidly and controllably vary concentration — a key process used in macro-scale experiments. Here, a droplet dilution module is described that traps a mother droplet and then repeatedly dilutes it releasing a series of droplets that define a digital concentration gradient.

Binding energies, lifetimes and implications of bulk and interface solvated electrons in water

Solvated electrons in liquid water are one of the seemingly simplest, but most important, transients in chemistry and biology, but they have resisted disclosing important information about their energetics, binding motifs and dynamics. Here we report the first ultrafast liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of solvated electrons in liquid water. The results prove unequivocally the existence of solvated electrons bound at the water surface and of solvated electrons in the bulk solution, with vertical binding energies of 1.6&nbsp;eV and 3.3&nbsp;eV, respectively, and with lifetimes longer than 100 ps. The unexpectedly long lifetime of solvated electrons bound at the water surface is attributed to a free-energy barrier that separates surface and interior states. Beyond constituting important energetic and kinetic benchmark and reference data, the results also help to understand the mechanisms of a number of very efficient electron-transfer processes in nature. The existence of solvated electrons bound at the liquid/water surface has not, until now, been proved experimentally. Here, using ultrafast photoelectron spectroscopy, the existence, vertical binding energies and lifetimes of solvated electrons bound at the water-surface/vacuum interface, and in bulk solution, have been revealed.

Strained endotaxial nanostructures with high thermoelectric figure of merit

Thermoelectric materials can directly generate electrical power from waste heat but the challenge is in designing efficient, stable and inexpensive systems. Nanostructuring in bulk materials dramatically reduces the thermal conductivity but simultaneously increases the charge carrier scattering, which has a detrimental effect on the carrier mobility. We have experimentally achieved concurrent phonon blocking and charge transmitting via the endotaxial placement of nanocrystals in a thermoelectric material host. Endotaxially arranged SrTe nanocrystals at concentrations as low as 2% were incorporated in a PbTe matrix doped with Na2Te. This effectively inhibits the heat flow in the system but does not affect the hole mobility, allowing a large power factor to be achieved. The crystallographic alignment of SrTe and PbTe lattices decouples phonon and electron transport and this allows the system to reach a thermoelectric figure of merit of 1.7 at ~800&nbsp;K. Developing efficient thermoelectric materials that can directly generate electrical power from heat is a challenge, but now a nanostructured system of SrTe nanocrystals in a Na2Te-doped PbTe matrix achieves high efficiency by blocking heat flow without impeding carrier flow.

Solution structure of a DNA double helix with consecutive metal-mediated base pairs

Metal-mediated base pairs represent a powerful tool for the site-specific functionalization of nucleic acids with metal ions. The development of applications of the metal-modified nucleic acids will depend on the availability of structural information on these double helices. We present here the NMR solution structure of a self-complementary DNA oligonucleotide with three consecutive imidazole nucleotides in its centre. In the absence of transition-metal ions, a hairpin structure is adopted with the artificial nucleotides forming the loop. In the presence of Ag(i) ions, a duplex comprising three imidazole–Ag+–imidazole base pairs is formed. Direct proof for the formation of metal-mediated base pairs was obtained from 1J(15N,107/109Ag) couplings upon incorporation of 15N-labelled imidazole. The duplex adopts a B-type conformation with only minor deviations in the region of the artificial bases. This work represents the first structural characterization of a metal-modified nucleic acid with a continuous stretch of metal-mediated base pairs. The incorporation of non-natural base pairs into double-stranded DNA, especially those mediated by metal–ligand interactions, offers new opportunities for synthetic DNA materials. The structural implications of such modifications will help guide developments in this area, and a solution structure of a B-type DNA duplex containing consecutive metal-mediated base pairs has now been elucidated.

Hierarchical functional gradients of pH-responsive self-assembled monolayers using dynamic covalent chemistry on surfaces

Surface chemistry is an important field of research, especially for the study and design of (bio)nanostructures in which nearly every atom lies at an interface. Here we show that dynamic covalent chemistry is an efficient tool for functionalizing surfaces in such a way that their interfacial properties can be varied controllably in space and time. Modulation of pH is used to tune the fast, selective and reversible attachment of functional amines (with different pKa values) to an aldehyde-coated surface. To illustrate the potential of this technique, we developed dynamic self-assembled monolayers (‘DynaSAMs’), which enable the hierarchical construction of mixed gradients comprising either small functional molecules or proteins. Control of the (bio)chemical composition at any point on the surface potentially provides a simple bottom-up method to access numerous surface patterns with a broad range of functionalities. The properties of surfaces can be tailored by coating them with a thin film of molecules, for example by forming self-assembled monolayers. Now, researchers have shown how dynamic covalent chemistry can be used to reversibly pattern different compounds on to a surface with a high degree of spatial control to produce molecular gradients.

Title: 
Drastic symmetry breaking in supramolecular organization of enantiomerically unbalanced monolayers at surfaces

There is considerable interest in skewing the transmission of chirality, or ‘handedness’, from the molecular to the supramolecular level so that single-handed superstructures are created from mixed enantiomer systems. One approach is to flip the chirality of all the molecular building blocks to the same handedness. However, manipulation of molecular chirality is not possible for non-interconvertible enantiomers, and mechanisms that skew such systems are unclear. Here, we track the molecule-to-supramolecular chiral transfer in such systems at the nanoscale by probing molecular monolayers at surfaces. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and theoretical modelling show that enantiomeric imbalances lead to nonlinear symmetry breaking in organization, driven by configurational entropy effects. Thus, the majority enantiomer readily organizes into its superstructure with the minority left fragmented and disorganized, and thus impeded from realizing its superstructure. Such effects promise new strategies in chiral separations and enantioselective processes, and may have contributed to the homochiral evolution of complex matter from prebiotic environments. When a racemic mixture of tartaric acid is adsorbed on a Cu(110) surface, the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers separate to form enantiopure domains that cover equal amounts of the substrate. Repeating the experiment with just a small excess of one enantiomer, however, has a drastic effect on the surface assembly with only the majority isomer forming ordered superstructures.

Surface-assisted cyclodehydrogenation provides a synthetic route towards easily processable and chemically tailored nanographenes

Atomically thin sheets of sp2-hybridized carbon—graphene—have enormous potential for applications in future electronic devices. Particularly promising are nanostructured (sub)units of graphene, the electronic properties of which can be tuned by changing the spatial extent or the specific edge termination of the carbon network. Processability and precise tailoring of graphene-derived structures are, however, still major obstacles in developing applications; both bottom-up and top-down routes are presently under investigation in attempts to overcome this limitation. Here, we propose a surface chemical route that allows for the atomically precise fabrication of tailored nanographenes from polyphenylene precursors. The cyclodehydrogenation of a prototypical polyphenylene on Cu(111) is studied using scanning tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory. We find that the thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds via several intermediate steps, two of which can be stabilized on the surface, yielding unprecedented insight into a dehydrogenative intramolecular aryl–aryl coupling reaction. Large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or nanographenes have huge potential for organic electronics applications, but it is challenging to synthesize them in a controlled way. Now, a surface chemical route has been used to produce tailored nanographenes with atomically precise control over the final structure.

Near-threshold H/D exchange in CD3CHO photodissociation

Measuring the isotopic abundance of hydrogen versus deuterium atoms is a key method for interrogating reaction pathways in chemistry. H/D ‘scrambling’ is the intramolecular rearrangement of labile isotopes of hydrogen atoms and when it occurs through unanticipated pathways can complicate the interpretation of such experiments. Here, we investigate H/D scrambling in acetaldehyde at the energetic threshold for breaking the formyl C–H bond and reveal an unexpected unimolecular mechanism. Laser photolysis experiments of CD3CHO show that up to 17% of the products have undergone H/D exchange to give CD2H&nbsp;+&nbsp;DCO. Transition-state theory calculations reveal that the dominant mechanism involves four sequential H- or D-shifts to form CD2HCDO, which then undergoes conventional C–C bond cleavage. At the lowest energy the molecule undergoes an average of 20 H- or D-shifts before products are formed, evincing significant scrambling of H and D atoms. Analogous photochemically induced isomerizations and isotope scrambling are probably important in both atmospheric chemistry and combustion reactions. Unexpected and significant isotope exchange is observed in the near-threshold photodissociation of isopically labelled acetaldehyde. Theoretical modelling indicates that, at the lowest energies considered, an average of 20 H- or D-shifts occur before dissociation — evidence for extensive isomerization.

Title: 
Triply interlocked covalent organic cages

Interlocked molecules comprise two or more separate components that are joined by ‘mechanical’ rather than covalent bonds. In other words, these molecular assemblies cannot be dissociated without the cleavage of one or more chemical bonds. Although recent progress has enabled the preparation of such topologies through coordination or templating interactions, three-dimensional interlocked covalent architectures remain difficult to prepare. Here, we present a template-free one-pot synthesis of triply interlocked organic cages. These 20-component dimers consist of two tetrahedral monomeric cages each built from four nodes and six linkers. The monomers exhibit axial chirality, which is recognized by their partner cage during the template-free interlocking assembly process. The dimeric cages also include two well-defined cavities per assembly, which for one of the systems studied led to the formation of a supramolecular host–guest chain. These interlocked organic molecules may prove useful as part of a toolkit for the modular construction of complex porous solids and other supramolecular assemblies. Interlocked molecules commonly include one (or more) monocyclic component — examples comprising bicyclic or tricyclic structures are much more rare and usually involve metal–ligand coordination or additional templates. Now, the dynamic self-assembly of twenty organic molecules in a one-pot synthesis has been shown to produce tetrahedral covalent cages, which interpenetrate during the process to form triply interlocked dimers.

Hydroacylation of α,β-unsaturated esters via aerobic C–H activation

The development of methods for carbon–carbon bond formation under benign conditions is an ongoing challenge for the synthetic chemist. In recent years there has been considerable interest in using selective C–H activation as a direct route for generating reactive intermediates. In this article, we describe the use of aldehyde auto-oxidation as a simple, clean and effective method for C–H activation, resulting in the generation of an acyl radical. This acyl radical can be used for carbon–carbon bond formation and herein we describe the application of this method for the hydroacylation of α,β-unsaturated esters without the requirement of additional catalysts or reagents. This methodology generates unsymmetrical ketones, which have been shown to have broad use in organic synthesis. The development of benign methods for carbon–carbon bond formation is a continuing challenge. Here, a simple procedure for the hydroacylation of α,β-unsaturated esters is described, in which auto-oxidation of aldehydes and subsequent acyl radical addition to α,β-unsaturated esters occurs without the need for additional reagents.

Synthesis of glycine-containing complexes in impacts of comets on early Earth

Delivery of prebiotic compounds to early Earth from an impacting comet is thought to be an unlikely mechanism for the origins of life because of unfavourable chemical conditions on the planet and the high heat from impact. In contrast, we find that impact-induced shock compression of cometary ices followed by expansion to ambient conditions can produce complexes that resemble the amino acid glycine. Our ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that shock waves drive the synthesis of transient C–N bonded oligomers at extreme pressures and temperatures. On post impact quenching to lower pressures, the oligomers break apart to form a metastable glycine-containing complex. We show that impact from cometary ice could possibly yield amino acids by a synthetic route independent of the pre-existing atmospheric conditions and materials on the planet. The formation of simple prebiotic organic compounds on early Earth is thought to be an important step in the origin of life. Molecular dynamics simulations of the conditions within cometary ice during planetary impact suggest a possible mechanism for the formation of glycine, an amino acid.

Using first principles to predict bimetallic catalysts for the ammonia decomposition reaction

The facile decomposition of ammonia to produce hydrogen is critical to its use as a hydrogen storage medium in a hydrogen economy, and although ruthenium shows good activity for catalysing this process, its expense and scarcity are prohibitive to large-scale commercialization. The need to develop alternative catalysts has been addressed here, using microkinetic modelling combined with density functional studies to identify suitable monolayer bimetallic (surface or subsurface) catalysts based on nitrogen binding energies. The Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface, with one monolayer of Ni atoms residing on a Pt(111) substrate, was predicted to be a catalytically active surface. This was verified using temperature-programmed desorption and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy experiments. The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals. The decomposition of ammonia is an important process if ammonia is to be used as a hydrogen storage medium. The most active catalyst for this is ruthenium, but its expense has provoked the search for alternatives. Now, using theory to guide the investigation, researchers have identified a bimetallic nickel–platinum surface as an active catalyst for this process.

Covalent bulk functionalization of graphene

Graphene, a truly two-dimensional and fully π-conjugated honeycomb carbon network, is currently evolving into the most promising successor to silicon in micro- and nanoelectronic applications. However, its wider application is impeded by the difficulties in opening a bandgap in its gapless band-structure, as well as the lack of processability in the resultant intrinscially insoluble material. Covalent chemical modification of the π-electron system is capable of addressing both of these issues through the introduction of variable chemical decoration. Although there has been significant research activity in the field of functionalized graphene, most work to date has focused on the use of graphene oxide. In this Article, we report on the first wet chemical bulk functionalization route beginning with pristine graphite that does not require initial oxidative damage of the graphene basal planes. Through effective reductive activation, covalent functionalization of the charged graphene is achieved by organic diazonium salts. Functionalization was observed spectroscopically, and successfully prevents reaggregation while providing solubility in common organic media. Efforts to make graphene more useful for applications include altering its bandgap and increasing its processability. Both of these can be solved by chemically modifying the material, and now a wet chemical method has been developed that functionalizes graphene in bulk starting from pristine graphite.

Stereoinduction by distortional asymmetry

Stereoselective chemical synthesis requires the two faces of a π bond to be differentiated. Theoretically sound qualitative models for understanding stereoinduction seem to break down in sterically unbiased cyclic systems. Presented here as the distortional asymmetry model is new insight that identifies circumstances where distortional ground state contributions are highly asymmetric and thereby contribute significantly to face selectivity. Out-of-plane distortional potential calculations, transition state calculations and molecular orbital analysis agree with experimental data that cannot otherwise be attributed to steric, torsion, polar or emergent transition state stabilizing effects. The model is readily understood in terms of reaction theory. The explanatory power of the model is also discussed. Steric, torsion, stereoelectronic and polar effects are widely used to explain and predict the stereochemical outcome of synthetic organic reactions. Here, the asymmetric distortion of the reactant is considered and used to explain the observed stereoselectivity where these accepted models are unable to provide a clear prediction.

Cis-dicarbonyl binding at cobalt and iron porphyrins with saddle-shape conformation

Diatomic molecules attached to complexed iron or cobalt centres are important in many biological processes. In natural systems, metallotetrapyrrole units carry respiratory gases or provide sensing and catalytic functions. Conceiving synthetic model systems strongly helps to determine the pertinent chemical foundations for such processes, with recent work highlighting the importance of the prosthetic groups' conformational flexibility as an intricate variable affecting their functional properties. Here, we present simple model systems to investigate, at the single molecule level, the interaction of carbon monoxide with saddle-shaped iron– and cobalt–porphyrin conformers, which have been stabilized as two-dimensional arrays on well-defined surfaces. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy we identified a novel bonding scheme expressed in tilted monocarbonyl and cis-dicarbonyl configurations at the functional metal-macrocycle unit. Modelling with density functional theory revealed that the weakly bonded diatomic carbonyl adduct can effectively bridge specific pyrrole groups with the metal atom as a result of the pronounced saddle-shape conformation of the porphyrin cage. Metalloporphyrins have a variety of roles in nature, including catalysis and the transport of respiratory gases, and many of these involve the binding of diatomic molecules. Now, the interaction of carbon monoxide with simple iron- and cobalt-porphyrins has been studied at the single-molecule level, revealing a surprising binding scheme.

Force-activated reactivity switch in a bimolecular chemical reaction

The effect of mechanical force on the free-energy surface that governs a chemical reaction is largely unknown. The combination of protein engineering with single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy allows us to study the influence of mechanical force on the rate at which a protein disulfide bond is reduced by nucleophiles in a bimolecular substitution reaction (SN2). We found that cleavage of a protein disulfide bond by hydroxide anions exhibits an abrupt reactivity ‘switch’ at ∼500&nbsp;pN, after which the accelerating effect of force on the rate of an SN2 chemical reaction greatly diminishes. We propose that an abrupt force-induced conformational change of the protein disulfide bond shifts its ground state, drastically changing its reactivity in SN2 chemical reactions. Our experiments directly demonstrate the action of a force-activated switch in the chemical reactivity of a single molecule. Mechanical stretching of a protein can be studied in detail using single-molecule experiments, and is shown to have an accelerating effect on its reaction with a nucleophile. The observation of a dramatic switch in the effect above a threshold force suggests an abrupt change in protein conformation and a change in reaction mechanism.

Regio- and stereoselectivity of P450-catalysed hydroxylation of steroids controlled by laboratory evolution

A current challenge in synthetic organic chemistry is the development of methods that allow the regio- and stereoselective oxidative C–H activation of natural or synthetic compounds with formation of the corresponding alcohols. Cytochrome P450 enzymes enable C–H activation at non-activated positions, but the simultaneous control of both regio- and stereoselectivity is problematic. Here, we demonstrate that directed evolution using iterative saturation mutagenesis provides a means to solve synthetic problems of this kind. Using P450 BM3(F87A) as the starting enzyme and testosterone as the substrate, which results in a 1:1 mixture of the 2β- and 15β-alcohols, mutants were obtained that are 96–97% selective for either of the two regioisomers, each with complete diastereoselectivity. The mutants can be used for selective oxidative hydroxylation of other steroids without performing additional mutagenesis experiments. Molecular dynamics simulations and docking experiments shed light on the origin of regio- and stereoselectivity. Selective reaction of one C–H bond among many in complex organic molecules is a grand challenge for organic chemistry. Here, starting from an enzyme that oxidizes two positions in a steroid without bias, laboratory evolution is used to prepare mutants that can regio- and stereoselectively oxidize either position.

Sugar synthesis in a protocellular model leads to a cell signalling response in bacteria

The design of systems with life-like properties from simple chemical components may offer insights into biological processes, with the ultimate goal of creating an artificial chemical cell that would be considered to be alive. Most efforts to create artificial cells have concentrated on systems based on complex natural molecules such as DNA and RNA. Here we have constructed a lipid-bound protometabolism that synthesizes complex carbohydrates from simple feedstocks, which are capable of engaging the natural quorum sensing mechanism of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi and stimulating a proportional bioluminescent response. This encapsulated system may represent the first step towards the realization of a cellular ‘mimic’ and a starting point for ‘bottom-up’ designs of other chemical cells, which could perhaps display complex behaviours such as communication with natural cells. Building artificial chemical systems that mimic the behaviour of cells could offer new insights into biological processes. Now, researchers show that by compartmentalizing the autocatalytic formose reaction inside lipid vesicles, and using small-molecule precursors as a ‘metabolic’ fuel, they can create a system that is capable of communicating with living bacterial cells.

Analysis of the reactivity and selectivity of fullerene dimerization reactions at the atomic level

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy has proved useful for its ability to provide time-resolved images of small molecules and their movements. One of the next challenges in this area is to visualize chemical reactions by monitoring time-dependent changes in the atomic positions of reacting molecules. Such images may provide information that is not available with other experimental methods. Here we report a study on bimolecular reactions of fullerene and metallofullerene molecules inside carbon nanotubes as a function of electron dose. Images of how the fullerenes move during the dimerization process reveal the specific orientations in which two molecules interact, as well as how bond reorganization occurs after their initial contact. Studies on the concentration, specimen temperature, effect of catalyst and accelerating voltage indicate that the reactions can be imaged under a variety of conditions. Well-resolved images of small molecules and their motions can be obtained with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It has now been shown that this technique can also be used to visualize individual chemical reactions involving the dimerization of fullerenes and metallo-fullerenes trapped inside carbon nanotubes by monitoring how the positions of their atoms change over time.

Title: 
Mutual modulation between membrane-embedded receptor clustering and ligand binding in lipid membranes

Thanks largely to a cooperative chelate effect, clustered membrane-embedded proteins favourably bind to multivalent ligands in solution and, conversely, a multivalent receptor can induce the clustering of membrane-embedded proteins. Here, we use a chemical model to show that the binding of a monovalent ligand and the clustering of a membrane-embedded receptor are closely related processes that modulate each other without the contribution of any apparent multivalence effect. Clearly, the confinement of the receptor within the surface reveals cooperative effects between clustering and binding that are too weak to detect in bulk-solution systems. This work shows that for membrane-embedded receptors that undergo some degree of spontaneous clustering, analyses based on multivalence-mediated cooperativity are insufficient to describe fully the molecular recognition events induced by ligands in solution. Instead, a binding–clustering thermodynamic cycle is proposed for the analysis of the interaction of any kind of ligand with membrane-embedded receptors. Using a chemical model, the binding of a monovalent ligand and the clustering of a membrane-embedded receptor are shown to be closely related processes that modulate each other without the contribution of any apparent multivalence effect.

Total synthesis of solanoeclepin A

Cyst nematodes are troublesome parasites that live on, and destroy, a range of important host vegetable plants. Damage caused by the potato cyst nematode has now been reported in over 50 countries. One approach to eliminating the problem is to stimulate early hatching of the nematodes, but key hatching stimuli are not naturally available in sufficient quantities to do so. Here, we report the first chemical synthesis of solanoeclepin A, the key hatch-stimulating substance for potato cyst nematode. The crucial steps in our synthesis are an intramolecular cyclization reaction for construction of the highly strained tricyclo[5.2.1.01,6]decane skeleton (DEF ring system) and an intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction of a furan derivative for the synthesis of the ABC carbon framework. The present synthesis has the potential to contribute to addressing one of the critical food issues of the twenty-first century. The first chemical synthesis of solanoeclepin A is described. The novel 5-4-6-7-5-5 polycyclic architecture was constructed in a stereoselective manner via a cyclopentene annulation strategy, the intramolecular cyclization of an epoxy nitrile intermediate, and an intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction of a furan derivative.

Peptide–nucleotide microdroplets as a step towards a membrane-free protocell model

Although phospholipid bilayers are ubiquitous in modern cells, their impermeability, lack of dynamic properties, and synthetic complexity are difficult to reconcile with plausible pathways of proto-metabolism, growth and division. Here, we present an alternative membrane-free model, which demonstrates that low-molecular-weight mononucleotides and simple cationic peptides spontaneously accumulate in water into microdroplets that are stable to changes in temperature and salt concentration, undergo pH-induced cycles of growth and decay, and promote α-helical peptide secondary structure. Moreover, the microdroplets selectively sequester porphyrins, inorganic nanoparticles and enzymes to generate supramolecular stacked arrays of light-harvesting molecules, nanoparticle-mediated oxidase activity, and enhanced rates of glucose phosphorylation, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that peptide–nucleotide microdroplets can be considered as a new type of protocell model that could be used to develop novel bioreactors, primitive artificial cells and plausible pathways to prebiotic organization before the emergence of lipid-based compartmentalization on the early Earth. Membrane-enclosed reaction compartments are considered important for establishing plausible pathways of prebiotic organization. Here, simple mixing of mononucleotides and cationic peptides in water is shown to produce microdroplets that sequester photo-active molecules, catalytic nanoparticles and enzymes. Such droplets might provide plausible pathways of prebiotic organization prior to the emergence of membrane-based compartmentalization on the early Earth.

Structural evolution during the reduction of chemically derived graphene oxide

The excellent electrical, optical and mechanical properties of graphene have driven the search to find methods for its large-scale production, but established procedures (such as mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapour deposition) are not ideal for the manufacture of processable graphene sheets. An alternative method is the reduction of graphene oxide, a material that shares the same atomically thin structural framework as graphene, but bears oxygen-containing functional groups. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the atomistic structure of progressively reduced graphene oxide. The chemical changes of oxygen-containing functional groups on the annealing of graphene oxide are elucidated and the simulations reveal the formation of highly stable carbonyl and ether groups that hinder its complete reduction to graphene. The calculations are supported by infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Finally, more effective reduction treatments to improve the reduction of graphene oxide are proposed. Thermal reduction of graphene oxide is an attractive route towards the preparation of graphene, but complete removal of residual oxygen is problematic. Now, molecular dynamics simulations elucidate the chemical changes involved in this process.

Title: 
Lattice-strain control of the activity in dealloyed core–shell fuel cell catalysts

Electrocatalysis will play a key role in future energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water electrolysers, fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Molecular interactions between chemical reactants and the catalytic surface control the activity and efficiency, and hence need to be optimized; however, generalized experimental strategies to do so are scarce. Here we show how lattice strain can be used experimentally to tune the catalytic activity of dealloyed bimetallic nanoparticles for the oxygen-reduction reaction, a key barrier to the application of fuel cells and metal–air batteries. We demonstrate the core–shell structure of the catalyst and clarify the mechanistic origin of its activity. The platinum-rich shell exhibits compressive strain, which results in a shift of the electronic band structure of platinum and weakening chemisorption of oxygenated species. We combine synthesis, measurements and an understanding of strain from theory to generate a reactivity–strain relationship that provides guidelines for tuning electrocatalytic activity. The rational design of catalytic materials requires synthetic control over their reactive properties. Now, the activity of dealloyed Pt–Cu bimetallic nanoparticles, which catalyse the oxygen reduction reaction, can be tuned through control of the geometric strain at their surface.

Title: 
Cooperative catalysis by carbenes and Lewis acids in a highly stereoselective route to γ-lactams

Enzymes are a continuing source of inspiration for the design of new chemical reactions that proceed with efficiency, high selectivity and minimal waste. In many biochemical processes, different catalytic species, such as Lewis acids and bases, are involved in precisely orchestrated interactions to activate reactants simultaneously or sequentially. This type of ‘cooperative catalysis’, in which two or more catalytic cycles operate concurrently to achieve one overall transformation, has great potential in enhancing known reactivity and driving the development of new chemical reactions with high value. In this disclosure, a cooperative N-heterocyclic carbene/Lewis acid catalytic system promotes the addition of homoenolate equivalents to hydrazones, generating highly substituted γ-lactams in moderate to good yields and with high levels of diastereo- and enantioselectivity. In nature, enzymes can orchestrate the combination of several different catalytic species, but mimicking this with synthetic catalysts is often problematic due to undesirable interactions between the catalysts. Here, an N-heterocyclic carbene and a Lewis acid cooperate to catalyse the efficient formation of γ-lactams.

Title: 
Chlorotrinitromethane and its exceptionally short carbon–chlorine bond

Compounds that deviate from the normal range of bonding can help to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the models currently used to describe chemical bonds. Furthermore, computer simulations of molecules require experimental data to describe accurately the energies and forces between interacting molecules. Compounds that contain the trinitromethyl group, with three nitro groups bonded to one carbon atom, show remarkable inter- and intramolecular effects. In this paper, we report the structural features of chlorotrinitromethane in the solid state and present the first reliable solid-state geometry parameters of an α-halogen derivative of the trinitromethyl pseudohalogen. We found several intriguing geometrical features in terms of intra- and intermolecular interactions, as well as an exceptionally short carbon–chlorine bond (1.694(1)&nbsp;Å). Using a combined crystallographic and computational approach, we show that these effects can be described in terms of the computed electrostatic potential of the molecular surface. Deviations from the normal bonding behaviour add to our understanding of bonding models and inform computer simulations. Chlorotrinitromethane has an extremely short carbon–chlorine bond and its solid-state structure has now been determined. Using a combination of crystallography and computation, its intra- and intermolecular interactions have also been studied.

A ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex for direct imaging of DNA structure in living cells

In the search for new biological imaging agents, metal coordination compounds able to emit from triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states offer many advantages as luminescent probes of DNA structure. However, poor cellular uptake restricts their use in live cells. Here, we present a dinuclear ruthenium(II) polypyridyl system that works as a multifunctional biological imaging agent staining the DNA of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells for both luminescence and transition electron microscopy. This MLCT ‘light switch’ complex directly images nuclear DNA of living cells without requiring prior membrane permeabilization. Furthermore, inhibition and transmission electron microscopy studies show this to be via a non-endocytotic, but temperature-dependent, mechanism of cellular uptake in MCF-7 cells, and confocal microscopy reveals multiple emission peaks that function as markers for cellular DNA structure. The ability to study structural changes of DNA in live cells is of considerable interest. Here, a dinuclear ruthenium (II) complex that acts as a multifunctional stain for DNA and its use in both luminescence and transmission electron microscopy studies is described.

Title: 
Carbon oxidation state as a metric for describing the chemistry of atmospheric organic aerosol

A detailed understanding of the sources, transformations and fates of organic species in the environment is crucial because of the central roles that they play in human health, biogeochemical cycles and the Earth's climate. However, such an understanding is hindered by the immense chemical complexity of environmental mixtures of organics; for example, atmospheric organic aerosol consists of at least thousands of individual compounds, all of which likely evolve chemically over their atmospheric lifetimes. Here, we demonstrate the utility of describing organic aerosol (and other complex organic mixtures) in terms of average carbon oxidation state, a quantity that always increases with oxidation, and is readily measured using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Field and laboratory measurements of the average carbon oxidation state, using several such techniques, constrain the chemical properties of the organics and demonstrate that the formation and evolution of organic aerosol involves simultaneous changes to both carbon oxidation state and carbon number. Organic aerosol particles are important to climate and human health but remain poorly characterized on account of their immense chemical complexity. Here, using both field and laboratory measurements of organic aerosol, we demonstrate the use of average carbon oxidation state for describing aerosol chemical properties and atmospheric transformations.

De novo synthesis of a metal–organic framework material featuring ultrahigh surface area and gas storage capacities

Metal–organic frameworks—a class of porous hybrid materials built from metal ions and organic bridges—have recently shown great promise for a wide variety of applications. The large choice of building blocks means that the structures and pore characteristics of the metal–organic frameworks can be tuned relatively easily. However, despite much research, it remains challenging to prepare frameworks specifically tailored for particular applications. Here, we have used computational modelling to design and predictively characterize a metal–organic framework (NU-100) with a particularly high surface area. Subsequent experimental synthesis yielded a material, matching the calculated structure, with a high BET surface area (6,143&nbsp;m2&nbsp;g−1). Furthermore, sorption measurements revealed that the material had high storage capacities for hydrogen (164&nbsp;mg&nbsp;g−1) and carbon dioxide (2,315&nbsp;mg&nbsp;g−1)—gases of high importance in the contexts of clean energy and climate alteration, respectively—in excellent agreement with predictions from modelling. Metal ions and organic linkers have been assembled into a wide variety of metal–organic frameworks, but tailoring the properties of these materials for specific applications by designing them from first principles has proved difficult. Now, a highly porous MOF that was first identified through computational studies has been prepared and found to exhibit excellent gas-uptake.

A two-dimensional phase of TiO2 with a reduced bandgap

Titanium dioxide is the prototypical transition metal oxide photocatalyst. However, the larger than 3&nbsp;eV bandgap of common bulk phases of TiO2 limits its light absorption to UV light, making it inefficient for solar energy conversion. Attempts at increasing visible light activity by narrowing the bandgap of TiO2 through doping have proven difficult, because of defect-induced charge trapping and recombination sites of photo-excited charge carriers. Here, we report the existence of a dopant-free, pure TiO2 phase with a narrow bandgap. This new pure TiO2 phase forms on the surface of rutile TiO2(011) by oxidation of bulk titanium interstitials. We measure a bandgap of only ~2.1&nbsp;eV for this new phase, matching it closely with the energy of visible light. The ability of TiO2 photocatalysts to absorb solar light has so far been limited to the UV because of their large bandgap. Now, a surface phase of TiO2 that possess a narrower bandgap closely matching the visible light energy has been synthesized at the surface of pure rutile TiO2(011) faces.

Title: 
Quantum-induced symmetry breaking explains infrared spectra of CH5+ isotopologues

For decades, protonated methane, CH5+, has provided new surprises and challenges for both experimentalists and theoreticians. This is because of the correlated large-amplitude motion of its five protons around the carbon nucleus, which leads to so-called hydrogen scrambling and causes a fluxional molecular structure. Here, the infrared spectra of all its H/D isotopologues have been measured using the ‘Laser Induced Reactions’ technique. Their shapes are found to be extremely dissimilar and depend strongly on the level of deuteration (only CD5+ is similar to CH5+). All the spectra can be reproduced and assigned based on ab initio quantum simulations. The occupation of the topologically different sites by protons and deuterons is found to be strongly non-combinatorial and thus non-classical. This purely quantum-statistical effect implies a breaking of the classical symmetry of the site occupations induced by zero-point fluctuations, and this phenomenon is key to understanding the spectral changes studied here. Stepwise deuteration of protonated methane CH5+ — a fluxional structure that undergoes ‘hydrogen scrambling’ — leads to dramatic changes in the infrared spectra of the isotopologues. The spectra can be assigned using ab initio quantum simulations that account for the non-classical occupation — by H and D atoms — of topologically different sites within the molecule.

Title: 
Random two-dimensional string networks based on divergent coordination assembly

The bulk properties of glasses and amorphous materials have been studied widely, but the determination of their structural details at the molecular level is hindered by the lack of long-range order. Recently, two-dimensional, supramolecular random networks were assembled on surfaces, and the identification of elementary structural motifs and defects has provided insights into the intriguing nature of disordered materials. So far, however, such networks have been obtained with homomolecular hydrogen-bonded systems of limited stability. Here we explore robust, disordered coordination networks that incorporate transition-metal centres. Cobalt atoms were co-deposited on metal surfaces with a ditopic linker that is nonlinear, prochiral (deconvoluted in three stereoisomers on two-dimensional confinement) and bears terminal carbonitrile groups. In situ scanning tunnelling microscopy revealed the formation of a set of coordination nodes of similar energy that drives a divergent assembly scenario. The expressed string formation and bifurcation motifs result in a random reticulation of the entire surface. The bulk properties of materials that lack long-range order have been widely studied, but their local structures remain difficult to elucidate. Now, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, researchers have been able to look more closely at the structural motifs of robust, two-dimensional glassy networks assembled through metal–ligand interactions.

Spin transition in a four-coordinate iron oxide

Spin transition has attracted the interest of researchers in various fields since the early 1930s, with thousands of examples now recognized, including those in minerals and biomolecules. However, so far the metal centres in which it has been found to occur are almost always octahedral six-coordinate 3d4 to 3d7 metals, such as Fe(II). A five-coordinate centre is only rarely seen. Here we report that under pressure SrFe(II)O2, which features a four-fold square-planar coordination, exhibits a transition from high spin (S&nbsp;=&nbsp;2) to intermediate spin (S&nbsp;=&nbsp;1). This is accompanied by a transition from an antiferromagnetic insulating state to a ferromagnetic so-called half-metallic state: only half of the spin-down (dxz,dyz) states are filled. These results highlight the square-planar coordinated iron oxides as a new class of magnetic and electric materials. Spin transitions — metal ions changing from high- to low-spin states — can be triggered by a range of stimuli and have normally only been observed in octahedrally coordinated ions. Now, a four-coordinate, square-planar iron(II) compound, SrFeO2, exhibits such a spin transition, accompanied by a transition from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a ferromagnetic half-metal.

Synthesis of conolidine, a potent non-opioid analgesic for tonic and persistent pain

Management of chronic pain continues to represent an area of great unmet biomedical need. Although opioid analgesics are typically embraced as the mainstay of pharmaceutical interventions in this area, they suffer from substantial liabilities that include addiction and tolerance, as well as depression of breathing, nausea and chronic constipation. Because of their suboptimal therapeutic profile, the search for non-opioid analgesics to replace these well-established therapeutics is an important pursuit. Conolidine is a rare C5-nor stemmadenine natural product recently isolated from the stem bark of Tabernaemontana divaricata (a tropical flowering plant used in traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic and Thai medicine). Although structurally related alkaloids have been described as opioid analgesics, no therapeutically relevant properties of conolidine have previously been reported. Here, we describe the first de novo synthetic pathway to this exceptionally rare C5-nor stemmadenine natural product, the first asymmetric synthesis of any member of this natural product class, and the discovery that (±)-, (+)- and (−)-conolidine are potent and efficacious non-opioid analgesics in an in vivo model of tonic and persistent pain. The first total synthesis of conolidine — representing the first asymmetric synthesis of a C5-nor-stemmadenine — is described. The chemical synthesis proceeds in just nine steps and gives an 18% overall yield from a commercially available pyridine — an achievement that led to the discovery that (+)-, (–)- and (±)-conolidine are potent non-opioid analgesics.

The effect of isotopic substitution on the chirality of a self-assembled helix

N,N′,N″-trialkylbenzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTAs) self-assemble by means of strong, threefold α-helix-type intermolecular hydrogen bonding into well-defined, helical, one-dimensional columnar aggregates. When a stereogenic centre is introduced into the alkyl side chains of these BTAs, strong Cotton effects are observed in dilute apolar solutions, indicating the preference for one helical conformation over the other. Here, we report the creation of a helical sense preference in self-assembled BTAs by introducing deuterium/hydrogen isotope chirality into the alkyl side chains. We determine the relative stabilities of the left- and right-handed helical conformations of these deuterated supramolecular polymers by performing a conformational analysis. Our findings show that the results of deuterium/hydrogen substitution in BTA-based supramolecular polymers and helical polyisocyanates are very similar, although the formation mechanisms differ. The selectively deuterated BTAs discussed here represent the first example of supramolecular chirality resulting from isotope substitution. Benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides are known to self-assemble via intramolecular hydrogen bonding into helical columnar aggregates. Here it is shown that the introduction of a stereocentre by an isotopic substitution — replacing hydrogen for deuterium on the methylene groups next to the amide — is sufficient to direct the helicity of the formed aggregate.

Spectroscopic visualization of sound-induced liquid vibrations using a supramolecular nanofibre

The question of whether sound vibration of a medium can bring about any kind of molecular or macromolecular events is a long-standing scientific controversy. Although it is known that ultrasonic vibrations with frequencies of more than 1&nbsp;MHz are able to align certain macromolecules in solution, no effect has yet been reported with audible sound, the frequency of which is much lower (20–20,000&nbsp;Hz). Here, we report on the design of a supramolecular nanofibre that in solution becomes preferentially aligned parallel to the propagation direction of audible sound. This phenomenon can be used to spectroscopically visualize sound-induced vibrations in liquids and may find application in a wide range of vibration sensing technologies. Although ultrasonic vibrations are known to be capable of aligning macromolecules in solution, the question of whether audible sound — which has much lower frequencies — can have such an effect is somewhat controversial. Now, however, it has been shown that supramolecular nanofibres can be preferentially aligned parallel to the propagation direction of audible sound.

Geometry-controlled kinetics

It has long been appreciated that the transport properties of molecules can control reaction kinetics. This effect can be characterized by the time it takes a diffusing molecule to reach a target—the first-passage time (FPT). Determining the FPT distribution in realistic confined geometries has until now, however, seemed intractable. Here, we calculate this FPT distribution analytically and show that transport processes as varied as regular diffusion, anomalous diffusion, and diffusion in disordered media and fractals, fall into the same universality classes. Beyond the theoretical aspect, this result changes our views on standard reaction kinetics and we introduce the concept of ‘geometry-controlled kinetics’. More precisely, we argue that geometry—and in particular the initial distance between reactants in ‘compact’ systems—can become a key parameter. These findings could help explain the crucial role that the spatial organization of genes has in transcription kinetics, and more generally the impact of geometry on diffusion-limited reactions. The time taken for a reactant to reach a target is best represented theoretically by a distribution of times. This distribution has now been calculated analytically and shows quantitatively that in the case of uncrowded environments, a reactant's starting point — in relation to the target — does not influence the search time. It does, however, have an effect in the case of crowded systems — leading to ‘geometry-controlled kinetics’.

Streamlined microwave-assisted preparation of narrow-bandgap conjugated polymers for high-performance bulk heterojunction solar cells

The most efficient plastic solar cells comprise a blend of conjugated polymer and a suitable electron acceptor, typically a fullerene derivative. Therefore narrow-bandgap conjugated polymers are currently sought for the fabrication of such devices. A significant challenge is being able to predict device function and performance from consideration of the molecular connectivity and dimensions of the partners within the active layer. Improved chemical syntheses are therefore required to make structurally varied polymers and enable the delineation of structure–function relationships with the aim of improving power conversion efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate that microwave heating in combination with the screening of comonomer reactant ratios can be used to obtain donor–acceptor copolymers with high average molecular weights and properties that make them suitable for solar cell incorporation. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of high molecular weight and the contribution of solubilizing side groups in determining the final device properties. Plastic solar cells contain a blend of conjugated polymer and fullerene electron-acceptor material that phase separates, resulting in the formation of heterojunctions. Improving the performance of these devices requires an understanding of the blend morphology. Now researchers show how a microwave-assisted synthesis method can be used to create structurally diverse copolymers enabling the investigation of their structure–function relationship.

Chiral imprinting of palladium with cinchona alkaloids

In the search for new materials and concepts in materials science, metallo-organic hybrids are attractive candidates; they can combine the rich diversity of organic molecules with the advantages of metals. Transition metals such as palladium are widely applied in catalysis, and small organic molecules such as those in the cinchona alkaloid family can control the stereochemistry of a number of organic reactions. Here, we show that reducing a metal salt in the presence of a cinchona alkaloid dopant gives a chirally imprinted metallo-organic hybrid material that is catalytically active and shows moderate enantioselectivity in hydrogenation. Furthermore, using photoelectron emission spectroscopy, we show that the metal retains some chiral character even after extraction of the dopant. This simple and effective methodology opens exciting opportunities for developing a variety of chiral composite materials. A metallo-organic hybrid material prepared by reduction of a palladium salt in the presence of cinchona alkaloids shows moderate enantioselectivity in organic transformations. The metal retains some chiral character after extraction of the dopant, selectively readsorbing the original alkaloid and showing different responses to clockwise and anticlockwise circularly polarized light.

A route to enantiopure RNA precursors from nearly racemic starting materials

The single-handedness of biological molecules is critical for molecular recognition and replication processes and would seem to be a prerequisite for the origin of life. A drawback of recently reported synthetic routes to RNA is the requirement for enantioenriched reactants, which fails to address the puzzle of how the single chirality of biological molecules arose. Here, we report the synthesis of highly enantioenriched RNA precursor molecules from racemic starting materials, with the molecular asymmetry derived solely from a small initial imbalance of the amino-acid enantiomers present in the reaction mixture. Acting as spectators to the main reaction chemistry, the amino acids orchestrate a sequence of physical and chemical amplification processes. The emergence of molecules of single chirality from complex, multi-component mixtures supports the robustness of this synthesis process under potential prebiotic conditions and provides a plausible explanation for the single-handedness of biological molecules before the emergence of self-replicating informational polymers. A drawback of recently reported prebiotic routes to RNA is a requirement for enantioenriched reactants. Here, the presence of a slightly enantioenriched amino acid in the reaction mixture is shown to drive the formation of enantiopure RNA precursors. This provides a plausible scenario in which single-handed biological molecules were formed prior to the emergence of self-replicating informational polymers.

A polyhedron made of tRNAs

Supramolecular assembly is a powerful strategy used by nature to build nanoscale architectures with predefined sizes and shapes. With synthetic systems, however, numerous challenges remain to be solved before precise control over the synthesis, folding and assembly of rationally designed three-dimensional nano-objects made of RNA can be achieved. Here, using the transfer RNA molecule as a structural building block, we report the design, efficient synthesis and structural characterization of stable, modular three-dimensional particles adopting the polyhedral geometry of a non-uniform square antiprism. The spatial control within the final architecture allows the precise positioning and encapsulation of proteins. This work demonstrates that a remarkable degree of structural control can be achieved with RNA structural motifs for the construction of thermostable three-dimensional nano-architectures that do not rely on helix bundles or tensegrity. RNA three-dimensional particles could potentially be used as carriers or scaffolds in nanomedicine and synthetic biology. Whereas synthetic DNA nanostructures are widely studied, the use of RNA as a structural building block is much less common. Now, it has been shown that tRNA molecules can be designed to assemble into a rigid and thermally stable square antiprism structure that may prove useful for delivery applications inside cells.

Nanocrystalline intermetallics on mesoporous carbon for direct formic acid fuel cell anodes

Shape- and size-controlled supported metal and intermetallic nanocrystallites are of increasing interest because of their catalytic and electrocatalytic properties. In particular, intermetallics PtX (X&nbsp;=&nbsp;Bi, Pb, Pd, Ru) are very attractive because of their high activity as fuel-cell anode catalysts for formic acid or methanol oxidation. These are normally synthesized using high-temperature techniques, but rigorous size control is very challenging. Even low-temperature techniques typically produce nanoparticles with dimensions much greater than the optimum &lt;6&nbsp;nm required for fuel cell catalysis. Here, we present a simple and robust, chemically controlled process for synthesizing size-controlled noble metal or bimetallic nanocrystallites embedded within the porous structure of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC). By using surface-modified ordered mesoporous carbon to trap the metal precursors, nanocrystallites are formed with monodisperse sizes as low as 1.5&nbsp;nm, which can be tuned up to ∼3.5&nbsp;nm. To the best of our knowledge, 3-nm ordered mesoporous carbon-supported PtBi nanoparticles exhibit the highest mass activity for formic acid oxidation reported to date, and over double that of Pt–Au. Formic acid fuel cells require nanosized intermetallic nanoparticles as anode catalysts, but current techniques are poor at producing the small size required. Now, surface-modified ordered mesoporous carbons have been used to produce nanocrystallites as small as 1.5&nbsp;nm that are extremely active catalysts.

Title: 
Monodisperse cylindrical micelles by crystallization-driven living self-assembly

Non-spherical nanostructures derived from soft matter and with uniform size—that is, monodisperse materials—are of particular utility and interest, but are very rare outside the biological domain. We report the controlled formation of highly monodisperse cylindrical block copolymer micelles (length dispersity&nbsp;≤&nbsp;1.03; length range, ∼200&nbsp;nm to 2&nbsp;µm) by the use of very small (∼20&nbsp;nm) uniform crystallite seeds that serve as initiators for the crystallization-driven living self-assembly of added block-copolymer unimers with a crystallizable, core-forming metalloblock. This process is analogous to the use of small initiator molecules in classical living polymerization reactions. The length of the nanocylinders could be precisely controlled by variation of the unimer-to-crystallite seed ratio. Samples of the highly monodisperse nanocylinders of different lengths that are accessible using this approach have been shown to exhibit distinct liquid-crystalline alignment behaviour. In analogy to classical living polymerizations, the controlled formation of highly monodisperse cylindrical micelles — ranging from approximately 200&nbsp;nm to 2&nbsp;µm in length — has been demonstrated using very small and uniform crystallite seeds as initiators for the crystallization-driven living self-assembly of block copolymers with a crystallizable, core-forming metalloblock.

Visible-light-mediated conversion of alcohols to halides

The development of new means of activating molecules and bonds for chemical reactions is a fundamental objective for chemists. In this regard, visible-light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful technique for chemoselective activation of chemical bonds under mild reaction conditions. Here, we report a visible-light-mediated photocatalytic alcohol activation, which we use to convert alcohols to the corresponding bromides and iodides in good yields, with exceptional functional group tolerance. In this fundamentally useful reaction, the design and operation of the process is simple, the reaction is highly efficient, and the formation of stoichiometric waste products is minimized. Visible light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful technique for chemoselective activation of chemical bonds under mild reaction conditions. Here, visible-light-mediated conversion of alcohols to the corresponding bromides and iodides is described. The reaction proceeds in good yield with exceptional functional group tolerance, and minimizes the formation of stoichiometric waste.

Catalytic asymmetric carbon–carbon bond formation via allylic alkylations with organolithium compounds

Carbon–carbon bond formation is the basis for the biogenesis of nature's essential molecules. Consequently, it lies at the heart of the chemical sciences. Chiral catalysts have been developed for asymmetric C–C bond formation to yield single enantiomers from several organometallic reagents. Remarkably, for extremely reactive organolithium compounds, which are among the most broadly used reagents in chemical synthesis, a general catalytic methodology for enantioselective C–C formation has proven elusive, until now. Here, we report a copper-based chiral catalytic system that allows carbon–carbon bond formation via allylic alkylation with alkyllithium reagents, with extremely high enantioselectivities and able to tolerate several functional groups. We have found that both the solvent used and the structure of the active chiral catalyst are the most critical factors in achieving successful asymmetric catalysis with alkyllithium reagents. The active form of the chiral catalyst has been identified through spectroscopic studies as a diphosphine copper monoalkyl species. Organolithiums are the prototypical nucleophilic reagent, but the direct use of them as nucleophiles in catalytic asymmetric synthesis has been problematic. Long sought after, conditions have now been identified that allow the highly enantioselective catalytic formation of C–C bonds by a direct SN2′ reaction of organolithiums with allylic halides.

Title: 
Size-specific catalytic activity of platinum clusters enhances oxygen reduction reactions

Colloidal platinum nanoparticles with diameters of 2–5&nbsp;nm on carbon supports are currently regarded as the best catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. However, the particle size is limited by the conventional preparation methods that are used to synthesize small platinum particles; the inherent activity of ultrasmall nanoparticles has not yet been revealed. We present a practical synthesis for ultrafine subnanometre platinum clusters using a spherical macromolecular template with no disorder in molecular weight or structure. The template, a phenylazomethine dendrimer, offers control of the number of metal complexes in an assembly through stepwise complexation, allowing the complexes to accumulate in discrete nano-cages. Subsequent reduction of Pt(IV) chloride to Pt(0) results in the formation of platinum clusters composed of a defined number of atoms. As a result of exceptionally small particle size, the clusters exhibit very high catalytic activity for the four-electron reduction of oxygen molecules. Platinum nanoparticles are excellent catalysts, but maintaining that effectiveness at ever smaller particle sizes is crucial to make best use of the precious metal. Now, a dendrimer has been used as a template to make subnanometre clusters, with a defined number of atoms, that exhibit high catalytic activity.

Towards quantum chemistry on a quantum computer

Exact first-principles calculations of molecular properties are currently intractable because their computational cost grows exponentially with both the number of atoms and basis set size. A solution is to move to a radically different model of computing by building a quantum computer, which is a device that uses quantum systems themselves to store and process data. Here we report the application of the latest photonic quantum computer technology to calculate properties of the smallest molecular system: the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis. We calculate the complete energy spectrum to 20 bits of precision and discuss how the technique can be expanded to solve large-scale chemical problems that lie beyond the reach of modern supercomputers. These results represent an early practical step toward a powerful tool with a broad range of quantum-chemical applications. Precise calculations of molecular properties from first-principles set great problems for large systems because their conventional computational cost increases exponentially with size. Quantum computing offers an alternative, and here the H2 potential energy curve is calculated using the latest photonic quantum computer technology.

Title: 
Photoelectrochemical complexes for solar energy conversion that chemically and autonomously regenerate

Naturally occurring photosynthetic systems use elaborate pathways of self-repair to limit the impact of photo-damage. Here, we demonstrate a complex consisting of two recombinant proteins, phospholipids and a carbon nanotube that mimics this process. The components self-assemble into a configuration in which an array of lipid bilayers aggregate on the surface of the carbon nanotube, creating a platform for the attachment of light-converting proteins. The system can disassemble upon the addition of a surfactant and reassemble upon its removal over an indefinite number of cycles. The assembly is thermodynamically metastable and can only transition reversibly if the rate of surfactant removal exceeds a threshold value. Only in the assembled state do the complexes exhibit photoelectrochemical activity. We demonstrate a regeneration cycle that uses surfactant to switch between assembled and disassembled states, resulting in an increased photoconversion efficiency of more than 300% over 168&nbsp;hours and an indefinite extension of the system lifetime. The impact of photo-damage on natural photosynthetic systems is lessened through their autonomous self-repair, and now a synthetic photoelectrochemical complex that mimics this behaviour has been developed. It is shown that a series of regeneration steps, driven by chemical signalling, increases the photo-conversion efficiency of the system and extends its lifetime indefinitely.

Synergistic self-assembly of RNA and DNA molecules

DNA has recently been used as a programmable 'smart' building block for the assembly of a wide range of nanostructures. It remains difficult, however, to construct DNA assemblies that are also functional. Incorporating RNA is a promising strategy to circumvent this issue as RNA is structurally related to DNA but exhibits rich chemical, structural and functional diversities. However, only a few examples of rationally designed RNA structures have been reported. Herein, we describe a simple, general strategy for the de novo design of nanostructures in which the self-assembly of RNA strands is programmed by DNA strands. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we have designed and constructed three different RNA–DNA hybrid branched nanomotifs (tiles), which readily assemble into one-dimensional nanofibres, extended two-dimensional arrays and a discrete three-dimensional object. The current strategy could enable the integration of the precise programmability of DNA with the rich functionality of RNA. DNA has been used as a building block to make a wide variety of molecular architectures, but it remains difficult to make functional structures from this particular construction material. Now, a strategy for the assembly of hybrid RNA–DNA nanostructures has been described, which offers the possibility of combining the programmability of DNA with the rich functionality of RNA.

Rapid preparation of flexible porous coordination polymer nanocrystals with accelerated guest adsorption kinetics

Porous coordination polymers, in particular flexible porous coordination polymer networks that change their network structure on guest adsorption, have enormous potential in applications involving selective storage, separation and sensing. Despite the expected significant differences in their adsorption properties, porous coordination polymer nanocrystals remain largely unexplored, and there have been no reports about studies on flexible porous coordination polymer nanocrystals, mainly due to a lack of preparation methods. Here, we present a new technique for the rapid preparation of porous coordination polymer nanocrystals that combines non-aqueous inverse microemulsion with ultrasonication. Uniform nanocrystals of {[Zn(ip)(bpy)]}n (ip&nbsp;=&nbsp;isophthalate, bpy&nbsp;=&nbsp;4,4′-bipyridyl; CID-1), a flexible porous coordination polymer, have been prepared by this method and analysed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. A model for particle formation and growth is presented and discussed. Adsorption experiments with methanol show that the overall adsorption capacities of nanoparticles and bulk are almost identical, but the shapes of the sorption isotherms differ significantly and the adsorption kinetics increase dramatically. Porous coordination polymers — PCPs, also known as metal–organic framework materials — have been widely investigated for their useful properties, but controlling their size and shape in a nanocrystalline form is difficult. Now, a rapid method of preparing porous crystalline nanosized PCPs that uses a microemulsion system under ultrasonic irradiation has been reported.

Title: 
Using personal glucose meters and functional DNA sensors to quantify a variety of analytical targets

Portable, low-cost and quantitative detection of a broad range of targets at home and in the field has the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. Despite many years of research, very few such devices are commercially available. Taking advantage of the wide availability and low cost of the pocket-sized personal glucose meter—used worldwide by diabetes sufferers—we demonstrate a method to use such meters to quantify non-glucose targets, ranging from a recreational drug (cocaine, 3.4&nbsp;µM detection limit) to an important biological cofactor (adenosine, 18&nbsp;µM detection limit), to a disease marker (interferon-gamma of tuberculosis, 2.6&nbsp;nM detection limit) and a toxic metal ion (uranium, 9.1&nbsp;nM detection limit). The method is based on the target-induced release of invertase from a functional-DNA–invertase conjugate. The released invertase converts sucrose into glucose, which is detectable using the meter. The approach should be easily applicable to the detection of many other targets through the use of suitable functional-DNA partners (aptamers, DNAzymes or aptazymes). Portable sensors for the rapid quantitation of a variety of analytical targets could revolutionize both medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. Here, functional DNA sensors that release the enzyme invertase in response to an analyte of choice are described. The enzyme converts sucrose to glucose which can then be easily detected using a widely available personal glucose meter.

Title: 
The role of steps in surface catalysis and reaction oscillations

Atomic steps at the surface of a catalyst play an important role in heterogeneous catalysis, for example as special sites with increased catalytic activity. Exposure to reactants can cause entirely new structures to form at the catalyst surface, and these may dramatically influence the reaction by ‘poisoning’ it or by acting as the catalytically active phase. For example, thin metal oxide films have been identified as highly active structures that form spontaneously on metal surfaces during the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide. Here, we present operando X-ray diffraction experiments on a palladium surface during this reaction. They reveal that a high density of steps strongly alters the stability of the thin, catalytically active palladium oxide film. We show that stabilization of the metal, caused by the steps and consequent destabilization of the oxide, is at the heart of the well-known reaction rate oscillations exhibited during CO oxidation at atmospheric pressure. Steps are known to be important sites on the surface of heterogeneous catalysts. Now it is shown that the density of steps on a palladium surface can alter its stability, and thus reactivity, and is key to understanding the oscillatory behaviour of the CO oxidation reaction at atmospheric pressure.

Title: 
Triflimide-catalysed sigmatropic rearrangement of N-allylhydrazones as an example of a traceless bond construction

The recognition of structural elements (that is, retrons) that signal the application of specific chemical transformations is a key cognitive event in the design of synthetic routes to complex molecules. Reactions that produce compounds without an easily identifiable retron, by way of either substantial structural rearrangement or loss of the atoms required for the reaction to proceed, are significantly more difficult to apply during retrosynthetic planning, yet allow for non-traditional pathways that may facilitate efficient acquisition of the target molecule. We have developed a triflimide (Tf2NH)-catalysed rearrangement of N-allylhydrazones that allows for the generation of a sigma bond between two unfunctionalized sp3 carbons in such a way that no clear retron for the reaction remains. This new ‘traceless’ bond construction displays a broad substrate profile and should open avenues for synthesizing complex molecules using non-traditional disconnections. A triflimide-catalysed rearrangement of N-allylhydrazones has been developed that allows for the generation of a sigma bond between two unfunctionalized sp3 carbons such that no clear marker remains for how the bond was formed. This traceless bond construction offers new avenues for convergent fragment coupling in synthetic strategies.

G-quadruplex self-assembly regulated by Coulombic interactions

Self-assembly offers the possibility to organize molecules in a given architecture through a subtle interplay between different noncovalent interactions. Although the kind of molecular association can often be predicted from information present in the individual molecules, the synthesis of supramolecular assemblies having a perfectly defined size and shape remains challenging. Here, we introduce the use of Coulombic interactions to control the supramolecular synthesis of finite, well-defined nanostructures. In particular, we demonstrate that the energy associated with the separation of ion pairs can regulate very precisely guanosine self-assembly into discrete G-quadruplexes. Assemblies comprising 8, 12, 16 or 24 guanosine molecules can be selectively and quantitatively obtained simply by tuning the stabilization of the dissociated anions in the solvent environment. Thus, factors such as solvent polarity, the nature of the anion and the cation–anion distance are shown to have a decisive role in the growth of G-quadruplexes. Self-assembly of discrete and well-defined supramolecular structures often requires a delicate balance of non-covalent forces such as hydrogen bonding and metal–ligand interactions. Now, by studying the formation of G-quadruplexes, it has been shown that the Coulombic energy associated with the separation of ion pairs can also be used to precisely regulate self-assembly processes.

Anhydrous proton conduction at 150 °C in a crystalline metal–organic framework

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are particularly exciting materials that couple porosity, diversity and crystallinity. But although they have been investigated for a wide range of applications, MOF chemistry focuses almost exclusively on properties intrinsic to the empty frameworks; the use of guest molecules to control functions has been essentially unexamined. Here we report Na3(2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetrisulfonate) (named β-PCMOF2), a MOF that conducts protons in regular one-dimensional pores lined with sulfonate groups. Proton conduction in β-PCMOF2 was modulated by the controlled loading of 1H-1,2,4-triazole (Tz) guests within the pores and reached 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10−4&nbsp;S&nbsp;cm−1 at 150&nbsp;°C in anhydrous H2, as confirmed by electrical measurements in H2 and D2, and by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. To confirm its potential as a gas separator membrane, the partially loaded MOF (β-PCMOF2(Tz)0.45) was also incorporated into a H2/air membrane electrode assembly. The resulting membrane proved to be gas tight, and gave an open circuit voltage of 1.18&nbsp;V at 100&nbsp;°C. Materials built from metal centres and organic ligands have traditionally attracted attention for their channels’ host–guest properties. Now, controlling the occupancy of the channels by guest molecules has resulted in a framework that conducts protons under anhydrous conditions and acts as a gas-tight membrane, offering a promising approach to fuel-cell electrolytes.

From silicon(II)-based dioxygen activation to adducts of elusive dioxasiliranes and sila-ureas stable at room temperature

Dioxygen activation for the subsequent oxygenation of organic substrates that involves cheap and environmentally friendly chemical elements is at the cutting edge of chemical research. As silicon is a non-toxic and highly oxophilic element, the use of silylenes could be attractive for facile dioxygen activation to give dioxasiliranes with a SiO2–peroxo ring as versatile oxo-transfer reagents. However, the latter are elusive species, and have been generated and studied only in argon matrices at −233&nbsp;°C. Recently, it was demonstrated that unstable silicon species can be isolated by applying the concept of donor–acceptor stabilization. We now report the first synthesis and crystallographic characterization of dioxasiliranes stabilized by N-heterocyclic carbenes that feature a three-membered SiO2–peroxide ring, isolable at room temperature. Unexpectedly, these can undergo internal oxygen transfer in toluene solution at ambient temperature to give a unique complex of cyclic sila-urea with C=O&nbsp;→&nbsp;Si=O interaction and the shortest Si=O double-bond distance reported to date. Converting dioxygen into more reactive species is extremely useful for direct oxygenation of organic compounds, but doing this with cheap and non-polluting elements is difficult. Now, a carbene-activated silylene has been shown to activate dioxygen, resulting in the isolation of elusive silicon–oxygen species at room temperature.

Protecting group and switchable pore-discriminating adsorption properties of a hydrophilic–hydrophobic metal–organic framework

Formed by linking metals or metal clusters through organic linkers, metal–organic frameworks are a class of solids with structural and chemical properties that mark them out as candidates for many emerging gas storage, separation, catalysis and biomedical applications. Important features of these materials include their high porosity and their flexibility in response to chemical or physical stimuli. Here, a copper-based metal–organic framework has been prepared in which the starting linker (benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid) undergoes selective monoesterification during synthesis to produce a solid with two different channel systems, lined by hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. The material reacts differently to gases or vapours of dissimilar chemistry, some stimulating subtle framework flexibility or showing kinetic adsorption effects. Adsorption can be switched between the two channels by judicious choice of the conditions. The monoesterified linker is recoverable in quantitative yield, demonstrating possible uses of metal–organic frameworks in molecular synthetic chemistry as ‘protecting groups’ to accomplish selective transformations that are difficult using standard chemistry techniques. Small modifications to the organic linkers in metal–organic framework materials (MOFs) can profoundly change their properties. Now, selective in situ esterification of a carboxylic-acid-based linker leads to a MOF with two types of channel having different surface chemistries. Adsorption into these channels is independent and can be switched using thermal or chemical triggers.

A biomolecule-compatible visible-light-induced azide reduction from a DNA-encoded reaction-discovery system

Using a system that accelerates the serendipitous discovery of new reactions by evaluating hundreds of DNA-encoded substrate combinations in a single experiment, we explored a broad range of reaction conditions for new bond-forming reactions. We discovered reactivity that led to a biomolecule-compatible, Ru(II)-catalysed azide-reduction reaction induced by visible light. In contrast to current azide-reduction methods, this reaction is highly chemoselective and is compatible with alcohols, phenols, acids, alkenes, alkynes, aldehydes, alkyl halides, alkyl mesylates and disulfides. The remarkable functional group compatibility and mild conditions of the reaction enabled the azide reduction of nucleic acid and oligosaccharide substrates, with no detectable occurrence of side reactions. The reaction was also performed in the presence of a protein enzyme without the loss of enzymatic activity, in contrast to two commonly used azide-reduction methods. The visible-light dependence of this reaction provides a means of photouncaging functional groups, such as amines and carboxylates, on biological macromolecules without using ultraviolet irradiation. A DNA-encoded reaction discovery system has revealed reactivity that led to the development of a visible-light-induced, biomolecule-compatible azide reduction. This reaction exhibits remarkable chemoselectivity and can be performed on oligonucleotide and oligosaccharide substrates, and in the presence of a protein enzyme, without undesired side reactions or loss of enzyme activity.

Ammonia formation by metal–ligand cooperative hydrogenolysis of a nitrido ligand

Bioinspired hydrogenation of N2 to ammonia at ambient conditions by stepwise nitrogen protonation/reduction with metal complexes in solution has experienced remarkable progress. In contrast, the highly desirable direct hydrogenation with H2 remains difficult. In analogy to the heterogeneously catalysed Haber–Bosch process, such a reaction is conceivable via metal-centred N2 splitting and unprecedented hydrogenolysis of the nitrido ligands to ammonia. We report the synthesis of a ruthenium(IV) nitrido complex. The high nucleophilicity of the nitrido ligand is demonstrated by unusual N–C coupling with π-acidic CO. Furthermore, the terminal nitrido ligand undergoes facile hydrogenolysis with H2 at ambient conditions to produce ammonia in high yield. Kinetic and quantum chemical examinations of this reaction suggest cooperative behaviour of a phosphorus–nitrogen–phosphorus pincer ligand in rate-determining heterolytic hydrogen splitting. One of the hurdles facing the development of effective catalysts to produce ammonia from nitrogen is the stability of the metal nitrides that form during the reaction. Now, the hydrogenolysis of nitride ligands with hydrogen is reported and attributed to PNP pincer ligand cooperativity.

A versatile approach to high-throughput microarrays using thiol-ene chemistry

Microarray technology has become extremely useful in expediting the investigation of large libraries of materials in a variety of biomedical applications, such as in DNA chips, protein and cellular microarrays. In the development of cellular microarrays, traditional high-throughput printing strategies on stiff, glass substrates and non-covalent attachment methods are limiting. We have developed a facile strategy to fabricate multifunctional high-throughput microarrays embedded at the surface of a hydrogel substrate using thiol-ene chemistry. This user-friendly method provides a platform for the immobilization of a combination of bioactive and diagnostic molecules, such as peptides and dyes, at the surface of poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels. The robust and orthogonal nature of thiol-ene chemistry allows for a range of covalent attachment strategies in a fast and reliable manner, and two complementary strategies for the attachment of active molecules are demonstrated. Many lab-on-a-chip applications use microarrays for the high-throughput screening of a range of materials, including biomolecules such as DNA and proteins, as well as living cells. To address some of the limitations of traditional printed microarrays, researchers have now developed robust hydrogel-based systems with thiol-ene chemistry that enables different covalent attachment strategies to be implemented in an orthogonal fashion.

A potential energy surface bifurcation in terpene biosynthesis

Terpenes comprise a class of natural products that includes molecules with thousands of distinct structurally and stereochemically complex molecular architectures. The core hydrocarbon frameworks of these molecules are constructed via carbocation rearrangements promoted by terpene synthase (cyclase) enzymes. Although many mechanistic details for such reactions have been uncovered, the factors that control which carbocation intermediates and transition-state structures form are not well understood. Here we show that rearrangement pathways that pass through particular transition-state structures can bifurcate after the transition state. The resulting pathways lead to terpenes with distinctly different skeletons from each other. Although these types of bifurcating pathways have been described previously for some small molecules, the possibility that they may have an important role in the production of complex molecules in nature has, to our knowledge, not previously been considered. Bifurcating reaction pathways are those for which a single transition-state structure leads to two separate products, and they have been seen previously in the reactions of certain small molecules. Now, calculations provide evidence for a pathway that bifurcates in the synthesis of a terpene — leading to distinctly different structures.

Direct enantio-convergent transformation of racemic substrates without racemization or symmetrization

Asymmetric reactions that transform racemic mixtures into enantio-enriched products are in high demand, but classical kinetic resolution produces enantiopure compounds in &lt;50% yield even in an ideal case. Many deracemization processes have thus been developed including dynamic kinetic resolution and dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, which can provide enantio-enriched products even after complete conversion of the racemic starting materials. However, these dynamic processes require racemization or symmetrization of the substrates or intermediates. We demonstrate a direct chemical enantio-convergent transformation without a racemization or symmetrization process. Copper(I)-catalysed asymmetric allylic substitution of a racemic allylic ether afforded a single enantiomer of an α-chiral allylboronate with complete conversion and high enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). One enantiomer of the substrate undergoes an anti-SN2′-type reaction whereas the other enantiomer reacts via a syn-SN2′ pathway. The products, which cannot be prepared by dynamic procedures, have been used to construct all-carbon quaternary stereocentres. Processes that convert racemic chiral compounds into enantioenriched chiral products are highly sought after. Here, in a copper-catalysed borylation reaction one enantiomer of a cyclic allylic ether reacts with anti-stereoselectivity and the other reacts with syn-stereoselectivity. The starting material is not easily racemized and this new process is dubbed an enantioconvergent reaction.

Reversing the direction in a light-driven rotary molecular motor

Biological rotary motors can alter their mechanical function by changing the direction of rotary motion. Achieving a similar reversal of direction of rotation in artificial molecular motors presents a fundamental stereochemical challenge: how to change from clockwise to anticlockwise motion without compromising the autonomous unidirectional rotary behaviour of the system. A new molecular motor with multilevel control of rotary motion is reported here, in which the direction of light-powered rotation can be reversed by base-catalysed epimerization. The key steps are deprotonation and reprotonation of the photochemically generated less-stable isomers during the 360° unidirectional rotary cycle, with complete inversion of the configuration at the stereogenic centre. The ability to change directionality is an essential step towards mechanical molecular systems with adaptive functional behaviour. Biological rotary motors can alter their mechanical function by changing the direction of rotary motion. Now, researchers have designed a synthetic light-driven rotary motor in which the direction of rotation can be reversed on command by changing the chirality of the molecular motor through base-induced epimerization.

Isolation of crystalline carbene-stabilized P2-radical cations and P2-dications

The discovery in 1900 by Gomberg that the trityl radical (Ph3C·) exists at room temperature is often considered to be the beginning of radical chemistry. Since then, persistent and even room-temperature stable radicals based on second-row and heavier elements have been synthesized. However, few of them have been characterized crystallographically, because they are either too reactive or dimerize in the solid state. Here, we show that a P2 fragment, capped with two bulky, strongly electron-releasing singlet carbenes (dicoordinate carbon compounds with only six valence electrons), can undergo one-electron oxidation, giving rise to room-temperature stable radical cations. Moreover, when N-heterocyclic carbenes are used, two-electron oxidation can also be performed, producing the corresponding stable dicationic diphosphene, which has to be regarded as a P22+ fragment coordinated by two carbenes. These results reveal a new application of stable singlet carbenes, the stabilization of paramagnetic species and electron-poor fragments. N-heterocyclic carbenes have been shown to be versatile ligands for metal catalysts and even catalysts in their own right. Here, bulky N-heterocyclic carbenes are shown to stabilize paramagnetic and electron-poor species sufficiently for their crystallographic characterization.

Chlorofullerenes featuring triple sequentially fused pentagons

The triple sequentially fused pentagons (TSFP) motif is one of the basic subunits that could be used for constructing fullerenes, but it violates the isolated pentagon rule (IPR) and has not been found in carbon cages to date. The properties of TSFP-incorporating fullerenes are thus poorly explored both theoretically and experimentally. Reported herein are four chlorinated derivatives of three different fullerene cages, all with the TSFP motif. X-ray crystallographic analyses indicate that the molecular strain inherent to the pentagon adjacency of a TSFP is significantly relieved upon exohedral chlorination, leaving one of the four pentagon fusion sites unsaturated and rendering the present derivatives chiral. This unique reactivity, in stark contrast to that of previously reported non-IPR fullerenes containing double fused pentagons or triple directly fused pentagons, can be rationalized by density functional theory calculations, and are expected to stimulate further studies of these new members of the fullerene family, both theoretically and experimentally. Fullerene cages that break the isolated pentagon rule are rare and often unstable. Now a range of fullerenes that feature three sequentially fused pentagons of carbon have been stabilized by chlorination.

Crystal structure of a metal ion-bound oxoiron(IV) complex and implications for biological electron transfer

Critical biological electron-transfer processes involving high-valent oxometal chemistry occur widely, for example in haem proteins [oxoiron(IV); FeIV(O)] and in photosystem II. Photosystem II involves Ca2+ as well as high-valent oxomanganese cluster species. However, there is no example of an interaction between metal ions and oxoiron(IV) complexes. Here, we report new findings concerning the binding of the redox-inactive metal ions Ca2+ and Sc3+ to a non-haem oxoiron(IV) complex, [(TMC)FeIV(O)]2+ (TMC&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). As determined by X-ray diffraction analysis, an oxo-Sc3+ interaction leads to a structural distortion of the oxoiron(IV) moiety. More importantly, this interaction facilitates a two-electron reduction by ferrocene, whereas only a one-electron reduction process occurs without the metal ions. This control of redox behaviour provides valuable mechanistic insights into oxometal redox chemistry, and suggests a possible key role that an auxiliary Lewis acid metal ion could play in nature, as in photosystem II. The interactions of metal ions with metaloxo species are crucial in many important biological processes, such as the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II, but their exact function remains elusive. Now, the binding of metal ions to a non-haem oxoiron complex has been studied and the observed changes to its electron-transfer properties provide insights into the active site of the OEC.

Ion mobility–mass spectrometry reveals a conformational conversion from random assembly to β-sheet in amyloid fibril formation

Amyloid cascades that lead to peptide β-sheet fibrils and plaques are central to many important diseases. Recently, intermediate assemblies of these cascades were identified as the toxic agents that interact with cellular machinery. The location and cause of the transformation from a natively unstructured assembly to the β-sheet oligomers found in all fibrils is important in understanding disease onset and the development of therapeutic agents. Largely, research on this early oligomeric region was unsuccessful because all the traditional techniques measure only the average oligomer properties of the ensemble. We utilized ion-mobility methods to deduce the peptide self-assembly mechanism and examined a series of amyloid-forming peptides clipped from larger peptides or proteins associated with disease. We provide unambiguous evidence for structural transitions in each of these fibril-forming peptide systems and establish the potential of this method for the development of therapeutic agents and drug evaluation. Amyloid cascades leading to peptide β-sheet fibrils are central to many diseases. Intermediate assemblies were recently identified as the toxic agents, but obtaining structural details of these early oligomers has largely been unsuccessful with traditional techniques. Here, ion mobility methods provide evidence for structural transitions from random to β-sheet assembly.

Strong exchange and magnetic blocking in N23−-radical-bridged lanthanide complexes

Single-molecule magnets approach the ultimate size limit for spin-based devices. These complexes can retain spin information over long periods of time at low temperature, suggesting possible applications in high-density information storage, quantum computing and spintronics. Notably, the success of most such applications hinges upon raising the inherent molecular spin-inversion barrier. Although recent advances have shown the viability of lanthanide-containing complexes in generating large barriers, weak or non-existent magnetic exchange coupling allows fast relaxation pathways that mitigate the full potential of these species. Here, we show that the diffuse spin of an N23− radical bridge can lead to exceptionally strong magnetic exchange in dinuclear Ln(III) (Ln&nbsp;=&nbsp;Gd, Dy) complexes. The Gd(III) congener exhibits the strongest magnetic coupling yet observed for that ion, while incorporation of the high-anisotropy Dy(III) ion gives rise to a molecule with a record magnetic blocking temperature of 8.3&nbsp;K at a sweep rate of 0.08&nbsp;T&nbsp;s−1. Single-molecule magnets hold great promise for device miniaturization but the blocking temperatures at which they perform must first reach practical values. Now, the electronically diffuse N23− radical bridge has been shown to endow two di-lanthanide complexes with good magnetic properties — a di-gadolinium complex displays a strong magnetic coupling and its di-dysprosium analogue a high blocking temperature.

Title: 
Rectification and stability of a single molecular diode with controlled orientation

In the molecular electronics field it is highly desirable to engineer the structure of molecules to achieve specific functions. In particular, diode (or rectification) behaviour in single molecules is an attractive device function. Here we study charge transport through symmetric tetraphenyl and non-symmetric diblock dipyrimidinyldiphenyl molecules covalently bound to two electrodes. The orientation of the diblock is controlled through a selective deprotection strategy, and a method in which the electrode–electrode distance is modulated unambiguously determines the current–voltage characteristics of the single-molecule device. The diblock molecule exhibits pronounced rectification behaviour compared with its homologous symmetric block, with current flowing from the dipyrimidinyl to the diphenyl moieties. This behaviour is interpreted in terms of localization of the wave function of the hole ground state at one end of the diblock under the applied field. At large forward current, the molecular diode becomes unstable and quantum point contacts between the electrodes form. The properties of molecular electronic devices can be tuned by tailoring the structures of the molecules from which they are built. Researchers now show that two closely related molecules — each containing a string of four aryl groups — behave very differently when strung between gold electrodes, with the non-symmetrical structure leading to diode-like behaviour.

Visualizing and identifying single atoms using electron energy-loss spectroscopy with low accelerating voltage

Visualizing atoms and discriminating between those of different elements is a goal in many analytical techniques. The use of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in such single-atom analyses is hampered by an inherent difficulty related to the damage caused to specimens by incident electrons. Here, we demonstrate the successful EELS single-atom spectroscopy of various metallofullerene-doped single-wall nanotubes (known as peapods) without massive structural destruction. This is achieved by using an incident electron probe with a low accelerating voltage (60&nbsp;kV). Single calcium atoms inside the peapods were unambiguously identified for the first time using EELS. Elemental analyses of lanthanum, cerium and erbium atoms were also demonstrated, which shows that single atoms with adjacent atomic numbers can be successfully discriminated with this technique. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is broadly used to examine chemical composition, but single-atom analysis is hampered by the damage caused by incident electrons. Now, with an EELS technique that does not cause such damage, single calcium atoms have been identified and various elemental analyses demonstrated using metallofullerene-doped nanotubes.

Gradient-driven motion of multivalent ligand molecules along a surface functionalized with multiple receptors

The kinetics of multivalent (multisite) interactions at interfaces is poorly understood, despite its fundamental importance for molecular or biomolecular motion and molecular recognition events at biological interfaces. Here, we use fluorescence microscopy to monitor the spreading of mono-, di- and trivalent ligand molecules on a receptor-functionalized surface, and perform multiscale computer simulations to understand the surface diffusion mechanisms. Analogous to chemotaxis, we found that the spreading is directional (along a developing gradient of vacant receptor sites) and is strongly dependent on ligand valency and concentration of a competing monovalent receptor in solution. We identify multiple surface diffusion mechanisms, which we call walking, hopping and flying. The study shows that the interfacial behaviour of multivalent systems is much more complex than that of monovalent ones. The kinetics of multivalent interactions at interfaces is poorly understood despite its fundamental importance for (bio)molecular motion and molecular recognition events at biological interfaces. Here, directional spreading of multivalent molecules has been observed, and multiple surface diffusion mechanisms have been identified and dubbed walking, hopping and flying.

Photoreactivity examined through incorporation in metal−organic frameworks

Metal−organic frameworks, typically built by bridging metal centres with organic linkers, have recently shown great promise for a wide variety of applications, including gas separation and drug delivery. Here, we have used them as a scaffold to probe the photophysical and photochemical properties of metal−diimine complexes. We have immobilized a M(diimine)(CO)3X moiety (where M is Re or Mn, and X can be Cl or Br) by using it as the linker of a metal−organic framework, with Mn(II) cations acting as nodes. Time-resolved infrared measurements showed that the initial excited state formed on ultraviolet irradiation of the rhenium-based metal−organic framework was characteristic of an intra-ligand state, rather than the metal−ligand charge transfer state typically observed in solution, and revealed that the metal−diimine complexes rearranged from the fac- to mer-isomer in the crystalline solid state. This approach also enabled characterization of the photoactivity of Mn(diimine)(CO)3Br by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically built by linking metal centres with organic bridges. By using metal–diimine complexes as linkers, researchers have now immobilized these photoresponsive moieties into a MOF scaffold, which enabled them to observe a different excited state from that occurring in solution, and study a photoreaction crystallographically.

Title: 
A synthetic small molecule that can walk down a track

Although chemists have made small-molecule rotary motors, to date there have been no reports of small-molecule linear motors. Here we describe the synthesis and operation of a 21-atom two-legged molecular unit that is able to walk up and down a four-foothold molecular track. High processivity is conferred by designing the track-binding interactions of the two feet to be labile under different sets of conditions such that each foot can act as a temporarily fixed pivot for the other. The walker randomly and processively takes zero or one step along the track using a ‘passing-leg’ gait each time the environment is switched between acid and base. Replacing the basic step with a redox-mediated, disulfide-exchange reaction directionally transports the bipedal molecules away from the minimum-energy distribution by a Brownian ratchet mechanism. The ultimate goal of such studies is to produce artificial, linear molecular motors that move directionally along polymeric tracks to transport cargoes and perform tasks in a manner reminiscent of biological motor proteins. Although molecular motors that ‘walk’ along tracks are common in biological systems, the only artificial analogues reported so far have been made from DNA. It has now been shown, however, that a synthetic small molecule with two ‘feet’ can take steps along a molecular track, and that the direction of movement can be biased under certain conditions.

Title: 
Efficient hydrogenation of organic carbonates, carbamates and formates indicates alternative routes to methanol based on CO2 and CO

Catalytic hydrogenation of organic carbonates, carbamates and formates is of significant interest both conceptually and practically, because these compounds can be produced from CO2 and CO, and their mild hydrogenation can provide alternative, mild approaches to the indirect hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to methanol, an important fuel and synthetic building block. Here, we report for the first time catalytic hydrogenation of organic carbonates to alcohols, and carbamates to alcohols and amines. Unprecedented homogeneously catalysed hydrogenation of organic formates to methanol has also been accomplished. The reactions are efficiently catalysed by dearomatized PNN Ru(II) pincer complexes derived from pyridine- and bipyridine-based tridentate ligands. These atom-economical reactions proceed under neutral, homogeneous conditions, at mild temperatures and under mild hydrogen pressures, and can operate in the absence of solvent with no generation of waste, representing the ultimate ‘green’ reactions. A possible mechanism involves metal–ligand cooperation by aromatization–dearomatization of the heteroaromatic pincer core. Producing methanol — useful as both a fuel and a synthetic building block — from carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide has been achieved using homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of carbonates, carbamates and formates. The catalyst is a dearomatized ruthenium(II) pincer complex and the reaction proceeds efficiently under mild conditions.

Using small molecules to facilitate exchange of bicarbonate and chloride anions across liposomal membranes

Bicarbonate is involved in a wide range of biological processes, which include respiration, regulation of intracellular pH and fertilization. In this study we use a combination of NMR spectroscopy and ion-selective electrode techniques to show that the natural product prodigiosin, a tripyrrolic molecule produced by microorganisms such as Streptomyces and Serratia, facilitates chloride/bicarbonate exchange (antiport) across liposomal membranes. Higher concentrations of simple synthetic molecules based on a 4,6-dihydroxyisophthalamide core are also shown to facilitate this antiport process. Although it is well known that proteins regulate Cl−/HCO3− exchange in cells, these results suggest that small molecules may also be able to regulate the concentration of these anions in biological systems. The transport of bicarbonate anions across cell membranes by proteins is an important biological process, and if not regulated properly it can lead to cystic fibrosis and heart disease. Now, it has been shown that ‘small’ molecules can also promote efficient bicarbonate transport across lipid membranes and could be used to probe this process.

Title: 
Bridging-ligand-substitution strategy for the preparation of metal–organic polyhedra

Metal–organic polyhedra—discrete molecular architectures constructed through the coordination of metal ions and organic linkers—have recently attracted considerable attention due to their intriguing structures, their potential for a variety of applications and their relevance to biological self-assembly. Several synthetic routes have been investigated to prepare these complexes. However, to date, these preparative methods have typically been based on the direct assembly of metal ions and organic linkers. Although these routes are convenient, it remains difficult to find suitable reaction conditions or to control the outcome of the assembly process. Here, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy based on the substitution of bridging ligands in soluble metal–organic polyhedra. The introduction of linkers with different properties from those of the initial metal–organic polyhedra can thus lead to new metal–organic polyhedra with distinct properties (including size and shape). Furthermore, partial substitution can also occur and form mixed-ligand species that may be difficult to access by means of other approaches. Discrete metal–organic polyhedra are usually prepared from metal ions and organic linkers by a direct self-assembly approach in solution. Now, using the polyhedra themselves as starting materials, it has been shown that a wider variety of structures can be obtained through the partial or complete substitution of their linkers.

Storable, thermally activated, near-infrared chemiluminescent dyes and dye-stained microparticles for optical imaging

Imaging techniques are a vital part of clinical diagnostics, biomedical research and nanotechnology. Optical molecular imaging makes use of relatively harmless, low-energy light and technically straightforward instrumentation. Self-illuminating, chemiluminescent systems are particularly attractive because they have inherently high signal contrast due to the lack of background emission. Currently, chemiluminescence imaging involves short-lived molecular species that are not stored but are instead generated in situ, and they typically emit visible light, which does not penetrate far through heterogeneous biological media. Here, we describe a new paradigm for optical molecular imaging using squaraine rotaxane endoperoxides, interlocked fluorescent and chemiluminescent dye molecules that have a squaraine chromophore encapsulated inside a macrocycle endoperoxide. Squaraine rotaxane endoperoxides can be stored indefinitely at temperatures below −20&nbsp;°C, but upon warming to body temperature they undergo a unimolecular chemical reaction and emit near-infrared light that can pass through a living mouse. An optical molecular imaging dye is described that is based on an interlocked squaraine rotaxane peroxide. These fluorescent and chemiluminescent dye molecules can be stored indefinitely at low temperature, but on warming to body temperature they undergo a unimolecular reaction, emitting near-infrared light that can pass through a living mouse.

Title: 
Assembly of a metal–organic framework by sextuple intercatenation of discrete adamantane-like cages

Metal–organic frameworks form a unique class of multifunctional hybrid materials and have myriad applications, including gas storage and catalysis. Their structure is usually achieved through the infinite coordination of metal ions and multidentate organic ligands by means of strong covalent bonds. Threaded molecules such as catenanes and rotaxanes have largely been restricted to comprising components of two-dimensional interlocking rings or polygons. There are very few examples of the catenation of polyhedral cages. Although it has been postulated that the infinite extended architecture can be obtained from the polycatenation of a discrete cage based on such threading, this has not been documented to date. Here we describe an infinite three-dimensional metal–organic framework composed of catenated polyhedral cages, in which the framework is achieved by mechanical interlocking of all of the vertices of the cages. The three-dimensional polycatenated framework shows twofold self-interpenetration in its crystal packing. The penetration of polycatenanes creates nanosized voids into which the Keggin polyoxometalate anions are perfectly accommodated as counteranions. There has been much interest in the assembly and properties of metal–organic frameworks. Here, a new type is described in which an infinite three-dimensional polycatenane is assembled from a discrete octahedral nanocage through the interlocking of all its six vertices.

Total synthesis of the large non-ribosomal peptide polytheonamide B

Polytheonamide B is by far the largest non-ribosomal peptide known at present, and displays extraordinary cytotoxicity (EC50&nbsp;=&nbsp;68&nbsp;pg&nbsp;ml−1, mouse leukaemia P388 cells). Its 48 amino-acid residues include a variety of non-proteinogenic d- and l-amino acids, and the absolute stereochemistry of these amino acids alternate in sequence. These structural features induce the formation of a stable β-strand-type structure, giving rise to an overall tubular structure over 30&nbsp;Å in length. In a biological setting, this fold is believed to transport cations across the lipid bilayer through a pore, thereby acting as an ion channel. Here, we report the first chemical construction of polytheonamide B. Our synthesis relies on the combination of four key stages: syntheses of non-proteinogenic amino acids, a solid-phase assembly of four fragments of polytheonamide B, silver-mediated connection of the fragments and, finally, global deprotection. The synthetic material now available will allow studies of the relationships between its conformational properties, channel functions and cytotoxicity. Polytheonamide B is a large non-ribosomal peptide with very high bioactivity. The synthesis described here includes the first preparation of several non-proteinogenic amino acids and a general coupling strategy for large non-natural peptides. The synthesis is a key step necessary to understand and utilize the bioactivity of this and similar compounds.

Uranium azide photolysis results in C–H bond activation and provides evidence for a terminal uranium nitride

Uranium nitride [U≡N]x is an alternative nuclear fuel that has great potential in the expanding future of nuclear power; however, very little is known about the U≡N functionality. We show, for the first time, that a terminal uranium nitride complex can be generated by photolysis of an azide (U–N=N=N) precursor. The transient U≡N fragment is reactive and undergoes insertion into a ligand C–H bond to generate new N–H and N–C bonds. The mechanism of this unprecedented reaction has been evaluated through computational and spectroscopic studies, which reveal that the photochemical azide activation pathway can be shut down through coordination of the terminal azide ligand to the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. These studies demonstrate that photochemistry can be a powerful tool for inducing redox transformations for organometallic actinide complexes, and that the terminal uranium nitride fragment is reactive, cleaving strong C–H bonds. The chemistry of the U≡N species is little known, even though solid uranium nitride has been proposed for use as a nuclear fuel. Now, photolysis of a uranium azide complex has been shown to release N2 and generate a transient U≡N fragment that can activate C–H bonds.

Supramolecular fishing for plasma membrane proteins using an ultrastable synthetic host–guest binding pair

Membrane proteomics, the large-scale global analysis of membrane proteins, is often constrained by the efficiency of separating and extracting membrane proteins. Recent approaches involve conjugating membrane proteins with the small molecule biotin and using the receptor streptavidin to extract the labelled proteins. Despite the many advantages of this method, several shortcomings remain, including potential contamination by endogenously biotinylated molecules and interference by streptavidin during analytical stages. Here, we report a supramolecular fishing method for membrane proteins using the synthetic receptor–ligand pair cucurbit[7]uril–1-trimethylammoniomethylferrocene (CB[7]–AFc). CB[7]-conjugated beads selectively capture AFc-labelled proteins from heterogeneous protein mixtures, and AFc-labelling of cells results in the efficient capture of membrane proteins by these beads. The captured proteins can be recovered easily at room temperature by treatment with a strong competitor such as 1,1′-bis(trimethylammoniomethyl)ferrocene. This synthetic but biocompatible host–guest system may be a useful alternative to streptavidin–biotin for membrane proteomics as well as other biological and biotechnological applications. Characterization of plasma membrane proteins is important in understanding fundamental biological processes and developing new drugs, but their separation remains a challenge. Now, a synthetic receptor–ligand pair based on ferrocene derivatives and cucurbit[7]uril is shown to have exceptionally high binding affinity, and enables membrane proteins to be isolated efficiently without any contamination from naturally biotinylated molecules.

Vesicular perylene dye nanocapsules as supramolecular fluorescent pH sensor systems

Water-soluble, self-assembled nanocapsules composed of a functional bilayer membrane and enclosed guest molecules can provide smart (that is, condition responsive) sensors for a variety of purposes. Owing to their outstanding optical and redox properties, perylene bisimide chromophores are interesting building blocks for a functional bilayer membrane in a water environment. Here, we report water-soluble perylene bisimide vesicles loaded with bispyrene-based energy donors in their aqueous interior. These loaded vesicles are stabilized by in situ photopolymerization to give nanocapsules that are stable over the entire aqueous pH range. On the basis of pH-tunable spectral overlap of donors and acceptors, the donor-loaded polymerized vesicles display pH-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the encapsulated donors to the bilayer dye membrane, providing ultrasensitive pH information on their aqueous environment with fluorescence colour changes covering the whole visible light range. At pH 9.0, quite exceptional white fluorescence could be observed for such water-soluble donor-loaded perylene vesicles. Artificial vesicles consisting of encapsulated fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-donor molecules and a FRET-acceptor bilayer dye-membrane provide ultrasensitive pH information in aqueous media by displaying pH-dependent fluorescence colour covering the entire visible light range. An exceptional white fluorescence was observed at pH 9.

Sequence-independent and rapid long-range charge transfer through DNA

Interest in using DNA as a building block for nanoelectronic sensors and devices stems from its efficient hole-conducting properties and the relative ease with which it can be organized into predictable nanometre-sized two- and three-dimensional structures. However, because a hole migrates along DNA through the highest occupied molecular orbital of the guanine bases, its conductivity decreases as the adenine–thymine base-pair content increases. This means that there are limitations on what sequences can be used to construct functional nanoelectronic circuits, particularly those rich in adenine–thymine pairs. Here we show that the charge-transfer efficiency can be dramatically increased in a manner independent of guanine–cytosine content by adjusting the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the adenine–thymine base pair to be closer to that of the guanine–cytosine pair. This is achieved by substituting the N7 nitrogen atom of adenine with a C–H group to give 7-deazaadenine, which does not disturb the complementary base pairing observed in DNA. The presence of adenine–thymine base pairs in DNA duplexes significantly reduces their electrical conductivity. However, by replacing adenine with a closely related analogue that does not disturb the normal complementary base pairing, it is possible to make duplexes that can transfer charge efficiently without having to use only guanine–cytosine base pairs.

New insights into the structure and reduction of graphite oxide

Graphite oxide is one of the main precursors of graphene-based materials, which are highly promising for various technological applications because of their unusual electronic properties. Although epoxy and hydroxyl groups are widely accepted as its main functionalities, the complete structure of graphite oxide has remained elusive. By interpreting spectroscopic data in the context of the major functional groups believed to be present in graphite oxide, we now show evidence for the presence of five- and six-membered-ring lactols. On the basis of this chemical composition, we devised a complete reduction process through chemical conversion by sodium borohydride and sulfuric acid treatment, followed by thermal annealing. Only small amounts of impurities are present in the final product (less than 0.5&nbsp;wt% of sulfur and nitrogen, compared with about 3&nbsp;wt% with other chemical reductions). This method is particularly effective in the restoration of the π-conjugated structure, and leads to highly soluble and conductive graphene materials. The unusual properties of graphene make it a promising candidate for nanoelectronics applications, but it remains a difficult material to make. Now, on the basis of spectroscopic data that characterize the graphene-precursor graphite oxide, researchers have devised an efficient reduction process for the large-scale production of nearly pure, highly conductive graphene sheets.

The effect of gold loading and particle size on photocatalytic hydrogen production from ethanol over Au/TiO2 nanoparticles

Catalytic hydrogen production from renewables is a promising method for providing energy carriers in the near future. Photocatalysts capable of promoting this reaction are often composed of noble metal nanoparticles deposited on a semiconductor. The most promising semiconductor at present is TiO2. The successful design of these catalysts relies on a thorough understanding of the role of the noble metal particle size and the TiO2 polymorph. Here we demonstrate that Au particles in the size range 3–30&nbsp;nm on TiO2 are very active in hydrogen production from ethanol. It was found that Au particles of similar size on anatase nanoparticles delivered a rate two orders of magnitude higher than that recorded for Au on rutile nanoparticles. Surprisingly, it was also found that Au particle size does not affect the photoreaction rate over the 3–12&nbsp;nm range. The high hydrogen yield observed makes these catalysts promising materials for solar conversion. The photocatalytic production of hydrogen from renewables such as ethanol and water could be a key means of future fuel production. There are few, if any, catalysts available for such a reaction, and our understanding of photocatalytic reactions generally remains poor. It is now demonstrated that gold–titania nanoparticles are effective catalysts for producing hydrogen from ethanol, and the rate is independent of gold particle size.

Convergent and stereospecific synthesis of complex skipped polyenes and polyunsaturated fatty acids

Skipped polyenes (that is, 1,4-dienes and higher homologues) are stereodefined components of a vast array of biologically important natural products, including polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although widespread in nature, these architectures are generally considered to represent significant barriers to efficient chemical synthesis. Partial reduction of skipped poly-ynes provides a pathway to a subset of such structures, but general chemical methods for the preparation of skipped polyenes that contain varied stereochemistries and substitution patterns are lacking. Here, we describe a metal-promoted reductive cross-coupling reaction between vinylcyclopropanes and alkynes (or vinylsilanes) that provides stereoselective access to a diverse array of skipped polyenes through a process that establishes one C?C bond, generates up to three stereodefined alkenes, and can be used to introduce stereogenic centres at the central positions of the skipped polyene motif. We also demonstrate the significance of the present bond construction by preparing substituted and stereodefined polyunsaturated synthetic fatty acids. A convergent route to stereodefined skipped polyenes, which proceeds through the direct union of vinylcyclopropanes with alkynes, is described. Overall, C?C bond formation occurs in concert with the establishment of up to three stereodefined alkenes, through a tandem stereoselective metallacycle-mediated coupling/stereospecific fragmentation sequence.

Dihydrogen contacts in alkanes are subtle but not faint

Alkane molecules are held together in the crystal state by purportedly weak homonuclear R–H···H–R dihydrogen interactions. In an apparent contradiction, the high melting points and vaporization enthalpies of polyhedranes in condensed phases require quite strong intermolecular interactions. Two questions arise: ‘How strong can a weak C–H···H–C bond be?’ and ‘How do the size and topology of the carbon skeleton affect these bonding interactions?’ A systematic computational study of intermolecular interactions in dimers of n-alkanes and polyhedranes, such as tetrahedrane, cubane, octahedrane or dodecahedrane, showed that attractive C–H···H–C interactions are stronger than usually thought. We identified factors that account for the strength of these interactions, including the tertiary nature of the carbon atoms and their low pyramidality. An alkane with a bowl shape was designed in the search for stronger dihydrogen intermolecular bonding, and a dissociation energy as high as 12&nbsp;kJ&nbsp;mol−1 is predicted by our calculations. Intermolecular non-polar H···H interactions between polyhedrane molecules may be as attractive as classical hydrogen bonds. A theoretical study identifies the chemical and structural factors that favour such attractive interactions.

Single-atom catalysis of CO oxidation using Pt1/FeOx

Platinum-based heterogeneous catalysts are critical to many important commercial chemical processes, but their efficiency is extremely low on a per metal atom basis, because only the surface active-site atoms are used. Catalysts with single-atom dispersions are thus highly desirable to maximize atom efficiency, but making them is challenging. Here we report the synthesis of a single-atom catalyst that consists of only isolated single Pt atoms anchored to the surfaces of iron oxide nanocrystallites. This single-atom catalyst has extremely high atom efficiency and shows excellent stability and high activity for both CO oxidation and preferential oxidation of CO in H2. Density functional theory calculations show that the high catalytic activity correlates with the partially vacant 5d orbitals of the positively charged, high-valent Pt atoms, which help to reduce both the CO adsorption energy and the activation barriers for CO oxidation. An important goal for the improvement of certain heterogeneous catalysts is to decrease the amount of platinum required while maintaining high catalytic activity. Now, the practical synthesis of a stable catalyst consisting of isolated single platinum atoms anchored onto iron oxide nanocrystallites has been developed that exhibits high activity for CO oxidation.

Radically enhanced molecular recognition

The tendency for viologen radical cations to dimerize has been harnessed to establish a recognition motif based on their ability to form extremely strong inclusion complexes with cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) in its diradical dicationic redox state. This previously unreported complex involving three bipyridinium cation radicals increases the versatility of host–guest chemistry, extending its practice beyond the traditional reliance on neutral and charged guests and hosts. In particular, transporting the concept of radical dimerization into the field of mechanically interlocked molecules introduces a higher level of control within molecular switches and machines. Herein, we report that bistable and tristable [2]rotaxanes can be switched by altering electrochemical potentials. In a tristable [2]rotaxane composed of a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) ring and a dumbbell with tetrathiafulvalene, dioxynaphthalene and bipyridinium recognition sites, the position of the ring can be switched. On oxidation, it moves from the tetrathiafulvalene to the dioxynaphthalene, and on reduction, to the bipyridinium radical cation, provided the ring is also reduced simultaneously to the diradical dication. The construction and operation of interlocked molecular machines often rely on the mutual recognition of different building blocks through a range of non-covalent interactions. Researchers have now shown that the versatility of bipyridinium systems can be increased by taking advantage of the complexes formed between their radical cations; with this approach they have been able to make electrochemically switchable bi- and tristable rotaxanes.

A combinatorial approach to the identification of self-assembled ligands for rhodium-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation

An effective and efficient means to catalyst discovery is the high-throughput screening of catalyst libraries. However, the current status of this approach suffers from a number of limitations, namely access to structurally diverse and meaningful ligand libraries and the enormous effort required for massive parallel screening of the resulting catalysts. We report an integrated solution to these drawbacks, which combines a diversity-oriented ligand synthesis, a catalyst-generation process driven by self-assembly and, finally, a combinatorial iterative library deconvolution strategy to identify the optimal catalyst. As a test case, rhodium-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation was studied and, from a library of 120 self-assembling catalysts, highly enantioselective catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of different olefinic substrates were identified within 17 experiments. Comparison of the results of the iterative library deconvolution strategy with those of the classic parallel-screening process confirmed the validity of this approach. Monodentate ligands with complementary hydrogen bonding units can self-assemble to form pseudo-bidentate ligands. Here, a combinatorial approach to the synthesis and analysis of reactions using these ligands allows the rapid identification of the most suitable ligand pair for highly selective rhodium-catalysed asymmetric hydrogenation.

An organic redox electrolyte to rival triiodide/iodide in dye-sensitized solar cells

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have achieved impressive conversion efficiencies for solar energy of over 11% with an electrolyte that contains triiodide/iodide as a redox couple. Although triiodide/iodide redox couples work efficiently in DSCs, they suffer from two major disadvantages: electrolytes that contain triiodide/iodide corrode electrical contacts made of silver (which reduces the options for the scale up of DSCs to module size) and triiodide partially absorbs visible light. Here, we present a new disulfide/thiolate redox couple that has negligible absorption in the visible spectral range, a very attractive feature for flexible DSCs that use transparent conductors as current collectors. Using this novel, iodide-free redox electrolyte in conjunction with a sensitized heterojunction, we achieved an unprecedented efficiency of 6.4% under standard illumination test conditions. This novel redox couple offers a viable pathway to develop efficient DSCs with attractive properties for scale up and practical applications. Although the triiodide/iodide redox couple works efficiently in dye-sensitized solar cells it restricts functionality by absorbing visible light. Now, a disulfide/thiolate redox couple that has negligible absorption in the visible spectral range is presented, which in conjunction with a sensitized heterojunction, displays an efficiency of 6.4% under standard illumination test conditions.

Exceptional ammonia uptake by a covalent organic framework

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous crystalline materials composed of light elements linked by strong covalent bonds. A number of these materials contain a high density of Lewis acid boron sites that can strongly interact with Lewis basic guests, which makes them ideal for the storage of corrosive chemicals such as ammonia. We found that a member of the covalent organic framework family, COF-10, shows the highest uptake capacity (15&nbsp;mol&nbsp;kg−1, 298&nbsp;K, 1&nbsp;bar) of any porous material, including microporous 13X zeolite (9&nbsp;mol&nbsp;kg−1), Amberlyst 15 (11&nbsp;mol&nbsp;kg−1) and mesoporous silica, MCM-41 (7.9&nbsp;mol&nbsp;kg−1). Notably, ammonia can be removed from the pores of COF-10 by heating samples at 200&nbsp;°C under vacuum. In addition, repeated adsorption of ammonia into COF-10 causes a shift in the interlayer packing, which reduces its apparent surface area to nitrogen. However, owing to the strong Lewis acid–base interactions, the total uptake capacity of ammonia and the structural integrity of the COF are maintained after several cycles of adsorption/desorption. The uptake of ammonia by a covalent–organic framework (COF) containing a high density of Lewis-acidic boron sites has been found to be significantly greater than that exhibited by other state-of-the-art porous materials. The ammonia can be removed by heating under vacuum and the structural integrity of the COF is maintained during adsorption/desorption cycles.

Highly enantioselective synthesis and cellular evaluation of spirooxindoles inspired by natural products

In biology-oriented synthesis the underlying scaffold classes of natural products selected in evolution are used to define biologically relevant starting points in chemical structure space for the synthesis of compound collections with focused structural diversity. Here we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of natural-product-inspired 3,3′-pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles—which contain an all-carbon quaternary centre and three tertiary stereocentres. This synthesis takes place by means of an asymmetric Lewis acid-catalysed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an azomethine ylide to a substituted 3-methylene-2-oxindole using 1–3&nbsp;mol% of a chiral catalyst formed from a N,P-ferrocenyl ligand and CuPF6(CH3CN)4. Cellular evaluation has identified a molecule that arrests mitosis, induces multiple microtubule organizing centres and multipolar spindles, causes chromosome congression defects during mitosis and inhibits tubulin regrowth in cells. Our findings support the concept that compound collections based on natural-product-inspired scaffolds constructed with complex stereochemistry will be a rich source of compounds with diverse bioactivity. A Lewis-acid-catalysed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition provides rapid access to a variety of substituted spirooxindoles. Initial cellular evaluations supports the view that compound collections based on natural-product-inspired scaffolds constructed with complex stereochemistry, and decorated with assorted substituents, will be a rich source of compounds with diverse bioactivity.

Cleave and capture chemistry illustrated through bimetallic-induced fragmentation of tetrahydrofuran

The cleavage of ethers is commonly encountered in organometallic chemistry, although rarely studied in the context of new, emerging bimetallic reagents. Recently, it was reported that a bimetallic sodium–zinc base can deprotonate cyclic tetrahydrofuran under mild conditions without opening its heterocyclic (OC4) ring. In marked contrast to this synergic sedation, herein we show that switching to the more reactive sodium–magnesium or sodium–manganese bases promotes cleavage of at least six bonds in tetrahydrofuran, but uniquely the ring fragments are captured in separate crystalline complexes. Oxide fragments occupy guest positions in bimetallic, inverse crown ethers and C4 fragments ultimately appear in bimetallated butadiene molecules. These results demonstrate the special synergic reactivity that can be executed by bimetallic reagents, which include the ability to capture and control, and thereby study, reactive fragments from sensitive substrates. Tetrahydrofuran can be unexpectedly cleaved by bimetallic sodium–magnesium and sodium–manganese bases. At least six bonds are broken in the one-pot reaction, but all fragments are separately captured to form crystalline compounds.

Self-assembling nanoprobes that display off/on 19F nuclear magnetic resonance signals for protein detection and imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most promising techniques for the non-invasive visualization of biomarkers and biologically relevant species, both in vivo and ex vivo. Although 1H MRI with paramagnetic contrast agents, such as Gd3+ complexes and iron oxide, is widely used, it often suffers from low contrast because of the large background signals caused by the abundant distribution of protons in biological samples. Here we report the use of supramolecular organic nanoparticles to detect specific proteins by 19F-based MRI in an off/on mode. In NMR spectroscopy these designed probes are silent when aggregated, but in the presence of a target protein they disassemble to produce a sharp signal. This ‘turn-on’ response allowed us to visualize clearly the protein within live cells by 19F MRI and construct an in-cell inhibitor assay. This recognition-driven disassembly of nanoprobes for a turn-on 19F signal is unprecedented and may extend the use of 19F MRI for specific protein imaging. A 19F magnetic resonance imaging signal from a protein-specific binding agent can be used to detect the presence of the target protein in live cells. The signal is switched off in the absence of target protein due to aggregation of the probe into nanoclusters.

Iridium-catalysed direct C–C coupling of methanol and allenes

Methanol is an abundant (35 million metric tons per year), renewable chemical feedstock, yet its use as a one-carbon building block in fine chemical synthesis is highly underdeveloped. Using a homogeneous iridium catalyst developed in our laboratory, methanol engages in a direct C–C coupling with allenes to furnish higher alcohols that incorporate all-carbon quaternary centres, free of stoichiometric by-products. A catalytic mechanism that involves turnover-limiting methanol oxidation, a consequence of the high energetic demand of methanol dehydrogenation, is corroborated through a series of competition kinetics experiments. This process represents the first catalytic C–C coupling of methanol to provide discrete products of hydrohydroxymethylation. Methanol is an abundant, renewable chemical feedstock. Here, a homogenous iridium catalyst enables a byproduct-free C–C coupling of methanol and allenes, producing higher alcohols that incorporate all-carbon quaternary centres.

A tri-continuous mesoporous material with a silica pore wall following a hexagonal minimal surface

Ordered porous materials with unique pore structures and pore sizes in the mesoporous range (2–50&nbsp;nm) have many applications in catalysis, separation and drug delivery. Extensive research has resulted in mesoporous materials with one-dimensional, cage-like and bi-continuous pore structures. Three families of bi-continuous mesoporous materials have been made, with two interwoven but unconnected channels, corresponding to the liquid crystal phases used as templates. Here we report a three-dimensional hexagonal mesoporous silica, IBN-9, with a tri-continuous pore structure that is synthesized using a specially designed cationic surfactant template. IBN-9 consists of three identical continuous interpenetrating channels, which are separated by a silica wall that follows a hexagonal minimal surface. Such a tri-continuous mesostructure was predicted mathematically, but until now has not been observed in real materials. Porous materials with very different pore sizes and structures are commonly used for various applications. But although bicontinuous pore networks — with two interwoven yet unconnected channels — have been reported, tricontinuous structures have so far only been predicted theoretically. Now, researchers have prepared a mesoporous silica with three identical, interpenetrating channels.

Water-oxidation catalysis by manganese in a geochemical-like cycle

Water oxidation in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms is catalysed by the Mn4CaO4 cluster of Photosystem II. This cluster has inspired the development of synthetic manganese catalysts for solar energy production. A photoelectrochemical device, made by impregnating a synthetic tetranuclear-manganese cluster into a Nafion matrix, has been shown to achieve efficient water oxidation catalysis. We report here in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies that demonstrate that this cluster dissociates into Mn(II) compounds in the Nafion, which are then reoxidized to form dispersed nanoparticles of a disordered Mn(III/IV)-oxide phase. Cycling between the photoreduced product and this mineral-like solid is responsible for the observed photochemical water-oxidation catalysis. The original manganese cluster serves only as a precursor to the catalytically active material. The behaviour of Mn in Nafion therefore parallels its broader biogeochemistry, which is also dominated by cycles of oxidation into solid Mn(III/IV) oxides followed by photoreduction to Mn2+. The development of an effective, cheap and robust water oxidation catalyst is crucial to the development of solar water-splitting technology. A manganese catalyst inspired by the water oxidizing centre of photosystem II is now shown to dissociate and reform into nanoparticles resembling the known natural oxidant mineral birnessite.

A biocompatible condensation reaction for controlled assembly of nanostructures in living cells

Through controlled synthesis and molecular assembly, biological systems are able to organize molecules into supramolecular structures that carry out sophisticated processes. Although chemists have reported a few examples of supramolecular assembly in water, the controlled covalent synthesis of large molecules and structures in vivo has remained challenging. Here we report a condensation reaction between 1,2-aminothiol and 2-cyanobenzothiazole that occurs in vitro and in living cells under the control of either pH, disulfide reduction or enzymatic cleavage. In vitro, the size and shape of the condensation products, and the nanostructures subsequently assembled, were different in each case and could thus be controlled by tuning the structure of the monomers. Direct imaging of the products obtained in the cells revealed their locations—near the Golgi bodies under enzymatic cleavage control—demonstrating the feasibility of a controlled and localized reaction in living cells. This intracellular condensation process enabled the imaging of the proteolytic activity of furin. Chemists have very few tools at their disposal for controlling synthetic processes under physiological conditions. Now, a monomer has been prepared that oligomerizes in living cells under the control of various triggers (pH change, disulfide reduction and enzymatic cleavage), showing promise for imaging or therapeutic applications.

A coordination chemistry dichotomy for icosahedral carborane-based ligands

Although the majority of ligands in modern chemistry take advantage of carbon-based substituent effects to tune the sterics and electronics of coordinating moieties, we describe here how icosahedral carboranes—boron-rich clusters—can influence metal–ligand interactions. Using a series of phosphine–thioether chelating ligands featuring meta- or ortho-carboranes grafted on the sulfur atom, we were able to tune the lability of the platinum–sulfur interaction of platinum(II)–thioether complexes. Experimental observations, supported by computational work, show that icosahedral carboranes can act either as strong electron-withdrawing ligands or electron-donating moieties (similar to aryl- or alkyl-based groups, respectively), depending on which atom of the carborane cage is attached to the thioether moiety. These and similar results with carborane-selenol derivatives suggest that, in contrast to carbon-based ligands, icosahedral carboranes exhibit a significant dichotomy in their coordination chemistry, and can be used as a versatile class of electronically tunable building blocks for various ligand platforms. Rather than tuning metal–ligand interactions using carbon-based substituents, the effect of icosahedral carborane moieties — boron-rich clusters — on the coordination chemistry of phosphine–thioether ligands has been investigated. Depending on the positional attachment of the sulfur atom, the carboranes acted as either strong electron-withdrawing or strong electron-donating substituents.

Experimental probing of conical intersection dynamics in the photodissociation of thioanisole

Chemical reactions that occur in the ground electronic state are described well by invoking the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which allows their development to be rationalized by nuclear rearrangements that smoothly traverse an adiabatic potential energy surface. The situation is different, however, for reactions in electronically excited states, where non-adiabatic transitions occur between adiabatic surfaces. The conical intersection, in which two adiabatic surfaces touch, is accepted widely as the dynamic funnel for efficient non-adiabatic transitions, but its direct experimental probing is rare. Here, we investigate the photodissociation of thioanisole and observe a striking dependence of the relative yields of two reaction channels on the photoexcitation energy as indicated by a dynamic resonance in the product branching ratio. This results from the interference of two different adiabatic states that are in close proximity in the region of a conical intersection. The location of the observed resonance on the multidimensional potential energy surface thus reveals the nuclear configuration of the conical intersection and its dynamic role in the non-adiabatic transition. Direct experimental probing of conical intersections is rare but here, in studies of the photodissociation of thioanisole, a striking dependence of the non-adiabatic transition probability on photoexcitation energy has been observed, revealing the nuclear configuration of the conical intersection and its dynamic role in such transitions.

Alloys of platinum and early transition metals as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts

The widespread use of low-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells for mobile applications will require significant reductions in the amount of expensive Pt contained within their cathodes, which drive the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Although progress has been made in this respect, further reductions through the development of more active and stable electrocatalysts are still necessary. Here we describe a new set of ORR electrocatalysts consisting of Pd or Pt alloyed with early transition metals such as Sc or Y. They were identified using density functional theory calculations as being the most stable Pt- and Pd-based binary alloys with ORR activity likely to be better than Pt. Electrochemical measurements show that the activity of polycrystalline Pt3Sc and Pt3Y electrodes is enhanced relative to pure Pt by a factor of 1.5–1.8 and 6–10, respectively, in the range 0.9–0.87&nbsp;V. Improvements in the activity and stability of catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions are needed to make low-temperature, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel-cells viable for mobile applications. Pt3Sc and Pt3Y are shown experimentally to have greater catalytic activity than pure Pt after being identified through computational investigation of Pt- and Pd-based alloys.

Activating catalysts with mechanical force

Homogeneously catalysed reactions can be ‘switched on’ by activating latent catalysts. Usually, activation is brought about by heat or an external chemical agent. However, activation of homogeneous catalysts with a mechanical trigger has not been demonstrated. Here, we introduce a general method to activate latent catalysts by mechanically breaking bonds between a metal and one of its ligands. We have found that silver(i) complexes of polymer-functionalized N-heterocyclic carbenes, which are latent organocatalysts, catalyse a transesterification reaction when exposed to ultrasound in solution. Furthermore, ultrasonic activation of a ruthenium biscarbene complex with appended polymer chains results in catalysis of olefin metathesis reactions. In each case, the catalytic activity results from ligand dissociation, brought about by transfer of mechanical forces from the polymeric substituents to the coordination bond. Mechanochemical catalyst activation has potential applications in transduction and amplification of mechanical signals, and mechanically initiated polymerizations hold promise as a novel repair mechanism in self-healing materials. Latent catalysts are usually activated by heating them or adding an external chemical agent, but now it has been shown that mechanical force is also an option in some instances. Ultrasound can be used to dissociate polymeric ligands from metal-containing complexes to reveal the innate catalytic ability of one of the two fragments.
